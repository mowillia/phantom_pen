It’s Wednesday, May 29. 

‣ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that if a Supreme Court seat opens up in 2020, he would hold a vote to confirm President Donald Trump’s nominee, a reversal from 2016, when he blocked former President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee because it was an election year.

Here’s what else we’re watching:

It’s Mueller Time: In his first public comments since his appointment two years ago, Special Counsel Robert Mueller reiterated the findings of his office’s investigation into Russian interference, and said he doesn’t have anything new to tell congressional committees should they ask. “The report is my testimony,” he said.

+ Mueller’s statement was a reassertion that the Justice Department has done all it can, and a call for the legislative branch of government to do more, reports Russell Berman. It’s your move, Congress, Mueller seemed to say.

+ Minutes after Mueller finished speaking, prominent Democrats began discussing the question of impeachment. A line of presidential candidates “emerged as though from a clown car” to weigh in on the topic, placing increasing pressure on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to green-light the proceedings, report Elaina Plott and Elaine Godfrey.

+ Work at the White House came to a standstill while Mueller was at the podium this morning, Peter Nicholas reports from the West Wing. Their obsession comes from Trump himself, who has tweeted twice as much about Mueller’s investigation as he has about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of his prime political foes. Following Mueller’s statement, Trump tweeted once more: “There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed!”
