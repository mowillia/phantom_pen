It’s Monday, May 6.

‣ More than 370 former federal prosecutors signed a statement asserting that, if he weren’t the president, Donald Trump would have been charged with obstruction based on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s findings.

‣ Over the weekend, Trump reversed himself to say that Mueller should not testify before Congress. (Trump said last week that it was up to Attorney General William Barr whether Mueller testified, but Barr said he had no issue with Mueller testifying.)

Young Dems Are Mad at Their Party: Sixty-eight chapters of the College Democrats are protesting the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee after it instituted a new policy to protect incumbents from primary challenges. Their outrage is notable not just because they’re the younger voters in the electorate—but because they’re some of the party’s key organizers.

Iran’s Murky Intentions: In a Sunday-night statement, National Security Adviser John Bolton announced that U.S. warships were headed to the Middle East, and invoked unspecified Iranian threats to the U.S. and its regional allies. But he also hinted at a more serious step: the threat of violence. “The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime,” Bolton said, but “any attack on United States interests or those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force.”

“By the mid 2020s, if a preponderance of young voters support an issue, the Democratic Party will probably have no choice but to make it central to the platform. Today, 43 percent of self-identified Democrats are either Gen Zers or Millennials. By 2024, by our calculations, this figure might rise to 50 percent. If the Democrats are not already the party of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, they will be soon.” → Read on.

“We are not a nation of political theorists or economists; we are ahistorical and poorly read. We can no more discuss the views of Karl Marx and their continued relevance today than we can chat about quantum mechanics with a kangaroo.” → Read on.

“One thing at least will follow from the president’s Twitter campaign: It will become even more difficult than before for the shamefaced remains of what used to be mainstream conservatism to separate themselves from these grifters, racists, and liars.” → Read on.
