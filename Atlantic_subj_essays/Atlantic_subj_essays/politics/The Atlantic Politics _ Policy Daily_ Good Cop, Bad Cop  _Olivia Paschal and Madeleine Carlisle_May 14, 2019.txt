‘Good Cop, Bad Cop’: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Russian President Vladimir Putin today, and Trump allies are trying to spin the president’s chumminess with Putin as just one part of a complex U.S. strategy toward Russia, Peter Nicholas and Kathy Gilsinan report. But who’s really being played here?

Moon Money: The Trump administration wants to put American astronauts on the moon again by 2024—and it’s asking Congress for $1.6 billion to do it. But 2024 is awfully soon, reports Marina Koren, and NASA has a long way to go to get a moon mission off the ground.

The Tariffs Start Coming and They Don’t Stop Coming: The Trump administration said it’s preparing to impose $300 billion in additional tariffs on Chinese imports, in retaliation against China’s retaliation. But Trump’s approach fundamentally misunderstands how tariffs work, argues Annie Lowrey: “The Chinese government is no more apt to fork over billions of yuan for Trump’s tariffs than Mexico’s government is to pay for a border wall. Rather, tariffs fall on the American importers of Chinese goods, who often pass those cost increases onto American consumers.”

The Root of a Conspiracy Theory: There’s a program that’s paid out about $229 million a year from 2013 to 2017 to people who claim they’ve been injured by vaccines. This federal-government initiative has “long percolated at the heart of misinformation and misunderstanding” over the safety of vaccines, writes James Hamblin. He looks at how the program came to be; why the government, not drug companies, is making payouts to alleged victims; and how the program became a flash point for conspiracy theorists.

Revisionism Is Winning in American Politics (Megan Garber)

Russia Has Americans’ Weaknesses All Figured Out (Jim Sciutto)
“U.S. military commanders, national-security officials, and intelligence analysts have a definitive answer: Russia is an enemy ... But the public has been slow to catch on, polls suggest, and Trump has given Americans little reason to believe that their president recognizes Russia’s recent actions as a threat.” → Read on.

Democrats Need to Place China at the Center of Their Foreign Policy (Thomas Wright)
“There is an incentive to think about new approaches that draw a stark contrast with Trump but also depart from the Obama administration.
