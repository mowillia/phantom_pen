12:48 AM October 11, 2014
Today I attended a ‘workshop’ held by “G Research”. They are a financial research wing of a Bank/Financial Institution in the UK. The workshop was half employer information session and half problem solving session. During the event, the attendees formed roughly six teams of four to five people and were given a problem they to work on. Over the course of three hours, we worked on two problems and afterwards there was a general question session. 
	I should say that I was very reluctant to attend this event. The advertisement posed it as a session which dealt specifically with Financial Modeling, something which I had no experience in. Although, a later email stated that one did not need any finance background to understand the problem, it turns out the original advertisement was essentially correct and the solution to the first problem was greatly aided by some background financial knowledge. To see a draft of the problems search for the pdf file “sp_misc_questions”. The problems (and the solution my team came up with) are at the end. 
	I learned some more general things about myself during this session. 

Anxiety: Something which is somewhat obvious. It is impossible to think when you are highly anxious. More precisely, it is difficult to think clearly, and if you are not thinking clearly you might as well be not thinking at all. During each problem session, my thoughts felt clipped and disorganized, like I was only using a small impotent part of my brain. I made simple mistakes (converting a .3 to a 1/3 for example) and I couldn’t follow careful logical arguments in my head. 
It was as though my mind had resorted to a lower order thinking style. I imagine such a style differs for all people, but for me it boiled down to mindlessly falling back on mathematics without thinking conceptually about the problem I was trying to solve.  
	In order to learn how to think better in such situations I either need to learn how to think while highly anxious, or I need to learn how to be less anxious in typically anxiety-producing situations. 
	
A Good Solution: It strikes me, now that I have thought carefully about it, that there was no ‘solution’ for at least one of the problems. There were good solutions and worse solutions, but since the problem was contingent on the behavior of other teams, and this behavior was in essence unpredictable and subject to change you could only choose a solution which minimized the adverse effects of possible behavior. However, if your solution was somehow known by the other teams, their solution could then be changed so that yours was less than optimal. In essence there was no single solution to the latter problem, only good an bad solutions. Sometimes this is what we need to look for in a problem. In stead of attempting to solve the problem exactly we need to work to eliminate the aspects of our solution which make it completely untenable. 

Concepts/Calculations: This point follows from the discussion about anxiety. I noticed there was a discrete difference between the way I looked at the (2nd) problem and the way the other graduate students looked at the problem. They were mostly concerned with conceptually understanding the problem and intuitively stating a solution according to the requirements they deemed it should have. I instead went straight to the mathematics and attempted to derive ‘the correct’ solution almost as though I was working on a textbook exercise. This was a silly approach because a few moments thought allows you to realize that the few analytic solutions you could obtain were not very useful when you considered the fact that other people’s behavior needed to be factored in. 
I am going to chalk this up to anxiety, but it is a problem that I’ve had in the past. Often,
when I don’t feel like thinking I simply grind through pages of mathematics hoping that the sequence of algebraic steps would faithfully leave me at the doorstep of the final answer. But in truth any problem which could be solved with such little thought is probably not worth solving. The conceptual situation surrounding a problem should be established before any mathematics is ‘grinded through’.

The Stretch: So this was a good experience for me. I learned quite a bit more about myself and how I think/how I want to think. But I didn’t really want to do it. I really just wanted to stay home and watch new episodes of ‘The Knick’ and ‘Please Like Me’. I only went because I had more or less made an unstated promise to myself to do so, and I had already accumulated enough self loathing for one week to renege on it. And I am indeed glad I went. To be candid, I do not always feel hopeful and inspired after I step outside my comfort zone like this. But, ignoring my fragile state of my mind for a moment, extending yourself in this way is really necessary. Saul called this the “Tension”. I call it the “Stretch”. The idea is essentially that you have to face the awkwardness, the discomfort, and the fear if you want anything which exists beyond what you currently do/experience. There is no easy way through to a better place, a place removed from your own daily cycle.
	Now if I were self-disciplined and mentally stable, I would claim that the lesson I should take away from this is that I should constantly put myself in situations where I will be forced to “stretch” in some way, the goal being that even if I fail within the context of the situation, I will still come to the end of it with more self knowledge, a self knowledge which could never be obtained through quietly writing in a room alone. But I am neither self-disciplined nor mentally stable, so I will not try to dictate the terms by which I should live my life. The truth is nevertheless acknowledged: if you want to grow, you have to get uncomfortable.  


10/17/14 7:07 pm
Every Friday night I go out to a club, so that every Saturday morning I am reminded of why I hate going to clubs. I had just left the office. Early, as I typically try to do on a Friday. Quietly closing the file cabinet and swiveling out of the squeaky chair as to not alert any other party to my premature escape. As a rule, there can be no eye-contact with the still cubical dwelling denizens of the office during the trip from your desk to the back door. Their judgmental gaze can positively ruin the first hour of a Friday night. My head low and my eyes fixed to the oatmeal colored carpeting I lighted across the floor passing Bill and Janice and Julie, without any incident. But of course, perfection is ever so rarely attained. Before the back exit stood Bob, patiently flipping and skimming a large packet of papers as though he were waiting for something. As though he were waiting for me. 

In spite of the fact I was still in the office at 5:15pm on a Friday, I managed to pull together a smile before Bob raised his head. 
	‘Ah, Ade’ he said. He had said my name but he had not pronounced it correctly. He said it like the end of the word ‘Band-Aid’ when in fact I had told him twice already that it was pronounced ‘Ah-day’. The smile was quickly fading under the weight of these circumstances. I had to move quickly to maintain appearances. 
	‘Did you get to the Technology Reports for Professor Hideki’s Mass Spectrometer?’
	‘Yes,’ I said, the grin failing by the second, ‘I just sent you an email.’ It was a lie, but desperate circumstances and all that. 
	‘Oh,’ he said. He reached into his pocket and glanced at his phone for less than a second. ‘It must be in my spam folder.’ 
Fuck. I thought. That wouldn’t be the last time a smart phone screwed me over that night. He returned the phone to his pocket and looked back up at me. 
‘Well’, he said with a smile which was too wide and enthusiastic to be inauthentic. ‘Have a good weekend.’
	I smiled back weakly and moved past him to the elevators. I could almost taste the outside air. The elevators were taking their sweet time riding up to the 6th floor, and I was suddenly seized by the fear that someone might come out through the elevators and try to talk to me. This was unacceptable. I had no choice but to take the stairs. 

I smiled back weakly and moved past him to the door. Entering the hallway, the air in the building seemed to change and it felt like I could taste the air outside. I walked to the elevator, and checked my phone to see if Salud, had replied to my message about his plans tonight. Nothing. 
	As I stood before the elevators I peered through the windows outside to see an alchemy of blue, black, and white shading the streets below. It was still snowing and forecasters had projected that it would continue to do so until late that night, but I decided I would remain committed. I would go to STATUS and I would for the second time talk to Marisol.
	I heard a ding for the elevator some floors below me, and I was immediately seized by the fear that I was losing my window of solitude. Any minute now someone might come through the elevators or from the office and try to chat me up, ask me if I had plans for the weekend. This was unacceptable. I had to take the stairs. 
	Going down 6 flights of stairs is less of a death trap of a workout than the reverse process, but it is no less tedious. Yet, sacrifices must be made for the greater objectives which lie beyond them. When I reached the ground floor, I realized this was all for nought. Damon was at the front desk, and I couldn’t reasonably pretend to not see him. I dug deep and restored the half smile to my face, as I walked up to him. His feet were on the desk, something he’s told me he isn’t supposed to do. When I had asked him why he continues to do it even though the building manager has told him repeatedly not to, he said “What’s the worst thing she could do? Fire me?” “Yes,” I nodded, “She can fire you.” He had shrugged and interlaced his fingers on top of his head. “What do I care?”, he had said. 
	As I walked towards him, Damon’s eyes were glued to a hidden corner of his desk. His eyes stayed there as he spoke to me. 
“So where are you off to so early, my good sir.” he asked. 
“I finished up early, so I’m just going to head home and catch up on some sleep,” I said. 
“Ahh,” Damon said as he took his feet off the desk and placed them on the floor looking at me for the first time. “Sleep is very important.”
“Yes,” I agreed, more with his act of self preservation than with his statement about sleep. Sleep was important to me, but given that I wasted so much time at a despised office job, whenever I got home I always worked to make up for the lost time and watch all the TV and play all the video games, I would have played if I didn’t have a job and could still magically bring in an income. Sleep took a back seat to ensuring I was sufficiently saturated with entertainment before I had to endure the next day. 
“So all you’re going home to do is sleep?” he asked, “I just got a text from Salud. He told me he was going to the club tonight. He said you might be coming along”
Salud. That bastard.

“Yes,” I agreed, more with his absent minded act of self preservation than with his comment about sleep. Sleep was important to me, but given that I wasted so much time in a cubicle confined existence, whenever I got home I always worked to make up for the hours lost and watch all the TV and play all the Far Cry 3 I would have played if I didn’t have a job and could still mystically bring in an income to purchase all of these distractions. Every night, when it got to be around 1 am, and I realized I had to make an explicit decision about whether I wanted to catch any extra Zs before another barely endurable day in the office, I typically ended up choosing entertainment over sleep. Of course, each morning I cursed my lack of forethought during the previous night, and made a vow, inevitably broken, to get more sleep the coming evening. 
	“So all you’re going home to do is sleep?” Damon asked, “I just got a text from Salud. He told me he was going to STATUS tonight. Said you might be coming along.”
	Salud. That bastard.
	“Right,” I said attempting to recover. “That was the plan, but he never got back to me. I assumed he had better things to do.”
	Damon nodded taking this in without comment. There was a silence which should have been interrupted by a change in the direction of the conversation, but instead just lingered on. Damon continued looking at his infernal screens and I continued standing there like an idiot. The silent treatment. I didn’t give a shit. I wasn’t going to break. I was a rock. I could not talk for hours. Hell I did it every day at work. 
	“If anything comes up,” I heard myself say, “want me to let you know?” Fuck. I thought. Where did that come from. 
	“Thanks,” Damon said like he was firing a bullet from pre-drawn fire arm, “but Salud already invited me and I can’t make it. I’ve got plans. Hot date.” 
	Hot date. Who says shit like that anymore? Especially without any sarcastic inflection or anything. Incurious and without any notion of a witty retort, It was my turn to nod silently. Why was I still here anyway? Sitting at the reception desk was Damon’s job. He had to be here. While, by the layout of the building I was only topographically required to be in the general vicinity of the front desk for the 30 or so seconds it took to walk from the elevators to the front door. 
	“Well,” I said stepping towards the door, “Have a good night.”
	“It’s with Marisol, in case you were curious.”
	I stopped at the name. It was involuntary but noticeable, and I had this sense that Damon was watching the back of my head, waiting for me to turn around and respond to this news. So Marisol wasn’t going to be at STATUS tonight. What the fuck? What kind of shit was Salud trying to pull? He had just spoken to Damon so he probably knew where Marisol was going on a date with him. No, he definitely knew. Was that why he wasn’t responding to my texts? I thought about this in a flash. I didn’t trust myself to meet Damon’s eyes without betraying anything, so I maintained my direction. 
	“She’s cute” I said with my hand on the glass panel of the door. “Good luck,” I added as I walked outside. 
	It was just as cold outside as it looked from the windows inside. The concrete was wet with melting ice and I treaded over the slick surface death traps like a debutante walking through a muddy country road. But I still kept up my speed. I was still pissed. I mean What The Fuck? If Marisol wasn’t going to be at the club was there any point for me to even go? I needed to talk to Salud. I dialed his number again, standing on the edge of the side walk. Just when it was about to go to voice mail, he picked up. 
	“Yo,” was the laconic first statement. Bitch, I thought to myself, you owe me more than a Yo. 
	“So, I just spoke to Damon.” I said as a means of a start. 
	“I was afraid of that,” he said immediately, “So you won’t believe what I learned last night. Your girl, Marisol, you know the one I was going to invite to STATUS tonight. Yo, she’s into Damon.  Like really into him. She texted me like a thousand times, trying to get me to set something up. And you know I tried to shift her attention a bit, I dropped your name a few times, but the girl wasn’t biting. She was focused. So I caved. I told Damon about her. You mad?”
	First Marisol, isn’t or wasn’t yet (and now maybe never will be) my girl. I talked to her at Salud’s Halloween party last weekend, but nothing, as they say, was in the bag. But damn was I interested. I mean the girl was beautiful. Like actually beautiful. Not just hot or cute, but that sort of beauty those post-medieval Italian artists dedicated to murals or some other shit like that. And she was a brain. Getting her Master’s in Chemistry before she went off to Pharmacy School because she actually liked science. And now my chance with her was slipping (had slipped?) through my fingers. And not to be a dick, but what would a girl like that see in a guy who worked reception for a building with a bunch of no name companies. Was I mad? Yes. But was I going to let Salud know this girl already had so much power over me? 
	“Dude,” I said, “I didn’t even like the girl that much.”
	Salud let out a short “Ha” then said “You don’t gotta lie to me man. But you’re right. It’s not a thing to worry about. Plenty more monkeys in the jungle. And you’re going to find another one tonight.”
	The hell I was. I was no longer in the mood to do anything tonight. Except of course fight the ancient demon boss in Far Cry 3. 
	“Yea, about that.” I started. “Right when I was leaving the office my boss saddled me with half a dozen more tech reports he wants done by Monday. I was going—“ I was cut short. 
	“Don’t give me that shit, man.” Salud said, “That girl’s just not interested in you. Don’t let her fuck up your Friday night too. We are going out tonight. I know where you live, and I can find you.” 
	This would have sounded more threatening if Salud hadn’t set me up with my current living situation: staying in a sublet owned by his Aunt. 

There’s something I need to tell you about Salud. He’s better with women than I am, but he’s not the best I’ve seen. Mostly, he has better rates than I do simply because he makes more attempts, or at least that’s what I tell myself. 

(Why doesn’t this character like people?)
(Why doesn’t he like Damon in particular?)
(Is sarcasm something intrinsic to his character?)

“I’m profoundly interested in the psychological condition of the Negro in this country,” Houston said. “Only a few people see and understand the complexity of this problem. And don’t think that my interest is solely political. It’s not; it was there long before I ever thought of entering politics.” He smiled cryptically and let his eyes wander over the icy landscape flowing past the train’s window. “My personal situation in life has given me a vantage point from which I’ve gained some insight into the problems of other excluded people.”
 […]
“We are not now keeping the Negro on such a short chain and they are slowly entering into our culture. But that is not the end of this problem. It is the beginning. . . .”
   “What do you mean, Ely?” Father Seldon asked. 
   “I mean this,” Houston hastened to explain. “Negroes as they enter our culture, are going to inherit the problems we have, but with a difference. They are outsiders and they are going to know  that they have these problems. They are going to be self-conscious; they are going to be gifted with a double vision, for, being Negroes, they are going to be both inside and outside of our culture at the same time. Every emotional and cultural convulsion that ever shook the heart and soul of Western man will shake them. Negroes will develop unique and specially defined psychological types. They will become psychological men, like the Jews. . . . They will not only be Americans, or Negroes; they will be centers of knowing, so to speak . . . . The political, social, and psychological consequences of this will be enormous.”
	- pg. 128 The Outsider Richard Wright

 
She smiled and laughed, but in her eyes there was a false brightness, and as she spoke she seemed to do so as a performance, as if behind her words there was a hidden message that constantly affirmed the distance between us, and in which she said “I talk to you here and now because I am polite and reasonable, but if we were the only souls walking in opposite directions down a long hallway, I would rather stare at the light fixtures on the ceiling than acknowledge you exist.”

Today I listened to a podcast in which Aisha Tyler discussed how she felt about being with people. In her discussion, she repeated the common refrain used to describe the difference between introverts and extroverts: “Extroverts,” she said “recharge their batteries by being with other people. While introverts recharge their batteries by being alone.” When I heard this for the umpteenth time today, I reflected back on my own experiences and thought about when I felt drained by those around me and when I felt more energized. True to the rule, I could cite many experiences where being surrounded by people left me exhausted and dull for sometime afterwards. But I could also cite some cases when being around a certain group of people galvanized something in me. 
	People say the division between introverts and extroverts is genetic and ingrained, but I think these people blur the line too much. For me its not an absolute rule that being by myself energizes me. It inevitably depends on what I do by myself, and often the thing that I believe will energize only further reduces my spirits. And it is again not a given that I dislike being around people because of the energy it requires. True, in most circumstances, being in large groups of anonymous strangers is not a positive place for me, but being in other groups with people I know and feel comfortable with is. 
	Moreover, I don’t think what ultimately divides people into introverts and extroverts is genetic: for me it was experiential. Through accumulated experiences, relationships with peers, and authority figures certain people learn that it is OK for them to express themselves honestly, and that when they do so they will not be faced with rejection or persecution. Other people do not fare so favorably and thus learn that if they are to be accepted by their communities, they must, while they exist in these communal spaces, pretend to be other people. This pretension requires energy and thus the people who engage in it feel drained when they’re continually forced to do it. For them it’s simply easier to just be alone than pretend to be someone else while you’re in a group.
That I think is what divides introverts and extroverts: introverts are people who have learned they have to hide themselves to be accepted by other people, while extroverts are able to move freely throughout the world because through repeated experiences they have learned they will be accepted wherever they go.  

In a way everyone is an extrovert when they are in a space where they feel safe and accepted, and everyone becomes an introvert when they feel these qualities of environment are missing.

And in went on like this for days. Everyone running around like decapitated poultry. No one stopping to question why the managers would give us an assignment like this or what would happen to the people we recruited. We were all driven by the myopic externally activated focus which made some students so successful in school.  And each time any of us spoke outside the office, the spectrum of our conversation remained narrowly focused on the assignment. “Have you collected your three yet? I’m thinking about getting this guy who lives in a floor below me. Last winter, when I asked him to water my plants for Thanksgiving, he never showed up. My poor azaleas had all but withered away by the time I came back. I mean, some people. . . .” It was three days in when I realized what was happening to me. When you enter these morally evacuated spaces where an objective acquires a primacy it would otherwise not have from a wider perspective, you need to watch yourself to make sure that the ethics on which your life was defined are not lost in some dubious means and ends analysis. I felt myself slipping. I now needed to do the work to return to who I thought I was.

There were about three ridges between me and the cliff summit, and they existed before me like mountains in of themselves. Julia must have seen the look on my face or seen that I lingered too long on the ridge below because just as I’m reaching pulling and reaching for the next ridge her hand juts out to reach mine like some kind of ethereal anchor meant to save me from an unfortunate descent. Notwithstanding the casualty of a bruised ego, there are some benefits to having a climbing partner beat you to the summit. I should have been prideful and struggled my way up alone, but the body wants what the body wants.

To tell you the truth. I’m pissed. 

I’m not mad that he didn’t tell me he was gonna do it. I’m not even mad about the $20 I loaned him that I’m now never gonna get back. No, what really pisses me off is the lost time. It’s all the times 
we were hanging out together shootin’ the shit about our classes and the girls who kept ignoring us when we could have been talking about something real. I mean, I don’t imagine that we would have ever talked about suicide; we were friends, but even I wouldn’t tell someone if I really planned on doing it. I don’t know why. It just wouldn’t be an interesting topic of conversation. But the reasons for why offing yourself seemed reasonable, now that is some deep shit. 
Cause you know there’s a lot of surface shit in the world, and I know you’re supposed to be fine pretending like that’s all there is, but sometimes it’s more work to pretend than otherwise. It’s like when you were a kid and you played hide and seek and you were the seeker, and you held your hands over your eyes, but after a while your arms got tired so you decided to peek a little. That’s how I felt back then. I just wanted to see the world as it was for a little bit. 
	And just my luck, here was someone I was friends with who must have also sensed something hidden behind what everyone else saw and took for granted. Now, his might have been a darker vision of the world than mine, but damn, we could have at least talked about it. We could have compared notes or something. I’m not saying I could have stopped him. But at least we could have talked about the reasons a hypothetically sane individual living in the world today might want to consider that route. Now, that is a conversation you can have without invading anyone’s personal space. And we could have had it. 

What pisses me off about it, is all the times we were hanging out and he pretended to be happy. I mean I don’t expect him to tell me he was planning to do it, but at least he could have referenced the way he felt. 

Just so we both knew that neither of us

Mobolaji = Mo-ba-o (hyphen underneath) la-ji = “I arrived with wealth” (ola = wealth, ji = to wake up)
When I was delivered, my father got a better job with more money. And the family had moved into a larger apartment. These were signs of comfort. And with wealth you have comfort. 

Olukayode = Oluwa – ko – ayo – de = “God has brought joy for us“ (Oluwa = God, ko = gather/pick, ayo = joy, de = ‘bringing home /arrive’)

Adegoke = Ade – gun – oke (gun = to climb, oke = height)
Name given to my father by a relative. My mom chose this name. The youngest of my father’s grand mother’s siblings gave him the name Ade Go Ke.

My parents had just delivered a girl, and they wanted a boy. And then I was born. Nigerian families typically want at least a boy and a girl. 

Ajo(hyphen)ke(hyphen) = A – jo – ke (A = we, jo = together, ke = to care fore)
We have to gather together to take care of this child. My father’s grandmother’s name. Grandmother was the first child of great grand parents. 

Olajumoke = Ola-jumo-ke (jumo =to rally/ joining forces or resources together)
We gathered our resources together and will take care of her. 

si = into

Questions
I am once again learning of the importance of asking questions. Homework assignments are always so restricted in what they require of students. There is so much focus on learning the correct techniques and concepts for a subject that there is little opportunity for students to practice asking and answering their own questions about what they learn. In order to properly teach students how to engage in a subject, teachers need not only teach them how to jump through hoops, but also how to make their own hoops to jump through.

Feel Free to Take Other Classes
I know you feel you have to take the classes you’re told to take and work to finish your course schedule as quickly as possible, but for your own sake I implore you to have a mind of your own. You have said repeatedly that you dislike physics, and assuming that this expression contains a kernel of truth, you must consequently devote yourself to exploring subjects outside of physics. This is primarily for your own sanity. If you only take physics courses, you will feel claustrophobic and unhappy. Look at the Data Science course you’re taking this semester. It doesn’t fit into a Physics only frame of course scheduling, and yet it is your favorite class this semester. So, don’t confine yourself to the box dictated by the subject you’re ‘supposed to study’. There is a subject worth studying out there if you’re willing to look for it outside of the standard curriculum.

Exploratory Analysis
A week ago I attended a talk on teaching problem solving to students in a science class. The talk was rather good, and had a fun exercise that I would like to try in a class room some time. But one thing that jumped out to me was one of the descriptions of the scientific process. I don’t remember the exact steps outlined in the process (perhaps I’ll email the speaker and get a copy of her talk), but one thing which stood out to me was the step of exploration. It’s something which is typically not outlined in the standard depiction of the scientific process, but it’s also something that you need to successfully work on any research project. 
	This exploration stage also tends to be more akin to a game, than an algorithmic method. You generate ideas, pursue the ideas in turn, and from these pursuits generate more ideas.
	The idea so jumped out at me because I realized I had been doing essentially the same thing in my Data Science course. For the problem sets, most of the problems required techniques that I did not know, and which I thus had to search for to find. Implementing the learned techniques in the assignment was a continued exercise in trial and error. I had to explore my way to a solution. 
	In a way, all students have to do this whenever they solve a problem in an assignment, but I think there should be greater involvement on the part of students in determining which questions direct their exploration.

Loosing Passion
I know I’ve written about this before, but alas I do not yet have a means to check the material for my new entries against topics I’ve covered in the past. So repetition is likely. 

I have often asked myself “What’s happening to me?” with regard to my relation to physics. I mean how can something I claimed to have loved so much, become such an impetus for frustration and anger? Before, I tried to deny it, or I at least tried to wrangle back some sense of control of the subject, but it’s all been for naught. Now, I’m trying to struggle less and see more. I’m no longer going to try to fight the regression. Instead I will try to observe it and understand what is happening. Even if I cannot stop it in the case of physics, perhaps I will be able to save some future passion from being lost to forces which are as of yet invisible to me. 

SO What’s my guess for what happened? I think it came from a mixing and an inconsistency between the physics I learned in school and the physics I taught myself. And it seemed that he more I engaged with the former, the less interest I had in physics. I was seeing physics as it was depicted in the curricula and assignments of educational institutions. I was no longer studying subjects because I wanted to study them; it was because I had to study them because physics was my major. And it seems, just like moving from courtship to marriage can smother the initial flame which founded a relationship , the imposed obligation of working slowly killed the nascent desire which originally motivated the work.  

Or maybe it was something else entirely. Maybe my insecurity, and the gaps in my heart caused me to attach too much existential importance to my work in physics. Finding little else in relationships to buoy me, I attempted to overcompensate for deficiencies in my psychological nutrition by trying to be sustained by physics alone. And like a child who eats too much of one thing and soon learns to hate his sole consumption, I too learned to hate physics. 

These are ideas. And only that. I don’t think I will ever know exactly what has happened. But working it out in this way is cathartic. Or at least I like to believe it is. 

11.17.2014
“But,” Adetunde asked, “How can they hate me? They don’t even know me.” 
“It’s quite simple, really.” Robert replied, “When they look at you they just replace an image of who you are with an image of who they think you are, as formed from the various people they’ve met who look like you.”

11.18.2014
What keeps you bound and trapped and unable to breathe is this sense of obligation. You have this idea that you have to be something otherwise your life will have no meaning. And you allow this something to be defined by the tasks assigned by the institutions which structure your life. It would be like if you were in high school and believing your existence was tied to how skilled you were at historical analysis. You would spend months reading texts, outlining, and drafting doing work which is not motivated by something intrinsically interesting about the work itself. It would be a sort of fevered work ethic, both in its pace and its effect on the human who holds it. Everything you do would bear a mark of shame for you know it is not the good work which could be done and also because you know it is not the work that you wish you were doing.

Few things reveal the extreme subjectivity in which most people live their lives than general self help books. Recently, I’ve realized that most of these books are not written to some unidentified community of people who may be going through some of the problems the author wrestled with in his or her past. Rather, the authors of these books are writing for and giving advice to past versions of themselves. When the author writes “You [general ambiguous decontextualized reader] should put people at ease by laughing at their jokes even when you don’t think they’re funny.” what he is really saying is that in his own past he found such a disingenuous display was useful. 

Because really, what does this author know about the details of your life, the context which surrounds your interactions with people and the way you feel? What does this author know about what it’s like to live in your head? This broad brush approach, suggesting how other people should live their lives even when you have no idea what their lives actually consist of, is not made in bad faith. It is done in ignorance, and a somewhat deluded belief that the experiences and beliefs which are important and true for me must also be so for everyone else.

Most of the time I’m self conscious, and unnecessarily observant, abstracting patterns from events which don’t have any underlying consistency to legitimize my conclusions. I react to the noise, and my mind jumps from glance to nod to look away trying to get some sense of meaning from the meaningless minutiae of each minute. And it is exhausting. And most of the time I can’t turn it off. But in those few oft times when through no decision on my part I’m thrust into cognitive realms of higher clarity, I feel unburdened. It is an active motility and flexibility of mind. It is like I’m a man who emerges from the viscous retardations of a summer pool onto the aerated concrete deck. I had been resistance training and all of a sudden the resistance has been turned off. 

And you know, I’ve seen this before. I saw it yesterday in fact. It was a rainy night and there were puddles strewn like aqueous land mines all the way from Dudley house to the Barker center. As I walked I kept my eyes to the ground, watching my feet and making sure my shoes, ill-suited to this aquatic environment, never stepped into too deep of a puddle. But as I tread carefully between the web like interface of cement and water, someone else passed by. Undisturbed by the water I was working so carefully to avoid, she walked as though the puddles weren’t even there. In fact, as she passed me and came to a stretch where the puddles were confined to a single side, she walked straight through the puddles and didn’t step onto the relatively dry walk beside her. At the time, I thought she was crazy, or like one of the strange externally non-conformists students I saw at MIT sometimes. Students who, to me, seemed to champion their difference the way a child might show off a brand new toy truck. 

But today I have a different interpretation. This girl perhaps wasn’t insane or superficially contrarian. Maybe, she walked through the puddles so easily because she felt safe, because she had protection, because she was wearing boots. You know, maybe because she had these boots on and had them on for such a long time before I had first seen her, she gradually learned to not even see these puddles. I mean maybe to her, they weren’t there because they were no longer relevant variables in her life. Whether she avoided them or didn’t avoid them, the result would be the same: she wouldn’t get wet.  

And you know, with winter coming and the weather getting worse, I can’t help but think that I need to get me a pair of boots too, so I can stop caring about these puddles, and so I can walk and look at the world instead of watching where I step and how and if I might get wet. Cause there’s a certain myopia which develops when you don’t have boots. You’re blind to the world because you have to spend so much time watching your feet. You have to make the puddles irrelevant in order to start seeing everything else. [//]

In Orbit
What keeps you bound, what keeps you static and stuck like an insect caught for thousands of years in an amulet of amber? It is your ideas of yourself and what your future is supposed to be which makes you incapable of appreciating your life at the moment. You are terrified by the distance between your idea of what life is and what your life currently is. You feel yourself being torn apart by the breadth. You believe there is this ‘X’, this final destination you can reach where you will be at peace and finally be able to breathe. You nod at the philosophical truth of “the journey being the destination in of itself”, and yet you still you seek some fixed point. But the world has no responsibility to conform to your idea of how it should be. All men have visions of the world, visions of better futures for themselves, and their family, and for people who look like them. They pursue these futures, dedicating their lives to their fruition, believing that a promised land exists and can be reached. You too believe in a promised land. And your belief in it guarantees that you will never see it.

The Contradiction at Work
Here we see an example of the contradiction at work. You want to be both “the prodigy” and “the amateur genius”, the “clear favorite” and “the underdog”. You want to be the student who didn’t do well in college because he felt un-motivated and bored, and yet you also want to be the stellar student with the perfect GPA. You can feel the two conceptions of yourself pulling at your sides, fighting over which will dominate at this moment, which identity you will claim as your own. But of course both identities are false, contextually empty notions of any individual. They are narratives pasted onto the lives of so called great men as a means of explaining away their greatness. But find any one man who’s achievement is explained because of one narrative, and you’ll find another who’s achievement is explained by the very anti-thesis of that narrative. 

The conclusion? You are trying to compare your life to the lives of historical figures, trying to conjure up some rubric for where you are and where you should go. This rubric, as stultifying and restrictive as it is, has gotten you to where you are, but the problem is that it seems unable to take you any further. There are stories we tell ourselves in order to give us comfort that the direction we have chosen is a correct one. Finding no analogous paths in the lives of men around us we may turn to history in an attempt to find a sense of solidarity. But your personal history is unique and accretes in the moment. Why should it be bound by the histories of men who are different and independent of you? 




12.2.14

First, there is the mistake, and then there is the anger for having made it. And if one is not careful the anger sits and loses its passion and slides into a surface level fear. Your horizon constricts and your world becomes slightly smaller as you try to organize your life so that you live with the least amount of disappointment possible.
The mistake was in not recognizing the anger as the opportunity it was. People are so often looking for unambiguous signals to tell them what to do with their lives. Most of the time we’re slightly bored and just getting by and when we’re not, we feel afraid, frauds who are pretending to be this thing that only professionals are properly trained for. We don’t know what we’re doing, and we don’t always know why we’re doing it. We hunger for something to direct us, to tell us whether what we’re doing is correct. And then when we make a mistake we fail to recognize it for the signal that it is. A mistake properly recognized and sufficiently cherished provides that unambiguous direction we’ve been searching for. It is a signal with bright lights telling us, “Not this way.” and if we are so willing we can then work to find another way to go. Assuming we are not making the same mistakes repeatedly, our mistakes indicate that we are living our lives at a precipice moving beyond the familiar and into a new territory where we are somewhat unprepared and unready to cleanly navigate the challenges it contains. The lack of mastery of a certain domain suggests that the domain is a new structure in our lives. These mistakes are not only indications of adventure but can also direct us to where more adventure is possible. 

Second draft: 
First there is the mistake, and then there is the anger for having made it. And if one is not careful, the anger loses its passion and sits and slides into something less useful: fear. Next, your horizons constrict and the world becomes smaller as in response to this fear, you try to organize your live so that you encounter the least disappointment possible. 

What we have here is a mistake duplicated. First there was the incorrect action, the initial mistake, itself, and then there was the inability to recognize the initial mistake for the opportunity it was. 

Many of us are getting by in the world, piecing together lives from what the mediated culture reflects back at us. And when we manage to begin something truly of our own devising, we feel like frauds who are pretending to be a thing that only other people were meant to be. In both cases we feel lost, not exactly sure what we’re doing, not exactly sure why we’re doing it. And so we hunger for something to direct us, to tell us whether the daily grind is moving us in a better direction. And a mistake properly recognized and appreciated does just this. 

There are two types of anger in this world. There is an entropic anger which is all noise and pain. It clouds the mind by drowning our thoughts in emotions which have no actionable outlet in the world. Then there is a cleaner anger, one that extracts from the event which elicited it the signal which may induce its own alchemy. And if we don’t think and we only react, all our anger can ever be is entropic, a viscous force to retard our progress in the world. But a more patient analysis of the event can suggest a future response so that the anger does not come again. And so we are changed. And so we have direction. 

Assuming we are not repeatedly making the same mistakes, each new mistake is an evidence of a special mode of living, each new misstep shows that we are living life on a precipice moving beyond familiar territory to a place where we are somewhat unready to cleanly navigate the challenges there in. Like the struggling sprouts of green on a desiccated and infertile ground, these mistakes are an indication of life and its potential if we so choose to see them that way.

Notes on Education: Why Only the Answers

It has always stricken me as strange that most textbooks in their presentation of a subject focus almost entirely on providing answers in the absence of the questions which historically motivated them. Taking in at a glance a typical physics text, one gets an overwhelming sense of “the what”: What the main principles of the subject are, what basic questions the subject can answer, what techniques are used to answer those questions, etc. But there is a much less clear sense of “the why”:  Why was this subject developed? Or more precisely, in response to what need, as an answer to what question, were the basic ideas of the subject formulated? If one more carefully looks at a subject, the motivating questions can usually be vaguely intuited but why aren’t they more explicit? To really get a sense of why a subject was developed, one typically has to leave the arena of pedagogical texts and look towards the historical books which document how the new field developed on the precipice of and an extension to some other old ideas. 

Perhaps the point is moot. The goal of a technical education is to teach students how to use a subject flexibly to solve problems and engage with a different aspect of the world. And in order to use a subject one need not know which questions originally motivated the development of the subject because inevitably the questions a student will answer in the future will be different from those which elicited the first investigations which developed the subject. 

And so, with regard to teaching, it is both a reasonable and easy strategy to leave out why the ideas you’re conveying were first developed. After the fact, one can always explicitly state why a subject was developed by referencing the questions the subject now helps answer. In the moment, however, one can only vaguely state the possible future directions of the subject, and since learning and education are primarily about the future (e.g. the student learns in order to solve future as of yet un-encountered problems) it is perhaps pedagogically safer to simply omit any historical sense of motivation and simply allow the student to find his/her own motivation when he encounters a new problem the methods he learned help him solve. 

Also, sometimes subjects become so firmly established in the canon of a field and serve as the foundation to many other pedagogical and research directions that having a concrete discussion of why the subject first developed and which questions the subject helps us answer seems unnecessary and redundant respectively. After some time, the original historical motivations for developing/learning subject become supplanted with new motivations grounded in what other subjects this first subject serves as a pre-requisite for. And by the time these other subjects are learned it is clear why the first subject needed to be learned before them. 

But independent of these justifications and looking at subjects distinctly from their service as pre-requisites to more advanced material, I think learning suffers when students learn techniques and methods independent of the questions which led to their development. It doesn’t matter that the new questions the student answers through these acquired methods will certainly not be similar to the questions which initially elicited these methods. A knowledge of the latter type of questions does not detract from the ability to answer the former, and moreover in order to properly learn a technique one need not only understand the algorithmic steps which encompass it, but also why the technique is important, namely the questions it helps us answer. Clearly, 

A presentation of science according to the questions, rather than decontextualized answers, will also better model the scientific process. New quantitative and qualitative techniques are not developed in a vacuum, but are responses to particular needs. Future techniques will be similarly developed and the student who realizes this will walk away with a clearer understanding of this important aspect of the scientific process. Textbooks, in their presentation of techniques first and motivating questions induce the false notion that in science it is the technical apparatus of a subject rather than the larger questions the subject answers which are the significant part. 

Still, I recognize the equal (or perhaps even greater) importance of preparing for future applications rather than being bound by what has been done in the past. This is why I think a middle ground is preferable. Teachers can certainly present both the historical motivations for the development of a certain technique and also the possible future arenas where the technique may be conducive to application. In fact for subjects which have been developed on relatively recent time scales the latter inevitably implies the former, and the two can be treated simultaneously. 

Summary Recommendation: When teaching a technical subject, don’t only present the technical details of the subject apart from the motivations of these details. Begin with the larger questions, and then gradually develop these questions, making them more precise until you are led to a question which justifies the development of the new technique.

My Father’s Stories

Adekunle’s Father
Today my father told me a story about his grand father on his father’s side. He said that from the age of six to nine, he would sometimes go to his grand father’s house. His name was Gbadebo (spelling?). My father tells me that with his grand father he would eat freshly caught fish, stew and bread for breakfast. They would drink tea or coffee with condensed milk. It was from my Gbadebo, my father tells me, that he learned how to make bread and stew. 

Before my father was ten years old Gbadebo passed away. Apparently, Gbadebo did not have a good relationship with his son Adekunle, my father’s father. In Gbadebo’s will he requested that before any of his requests were read that his son should leave the premises. Gbadebo’s estate was then given to his daughter, my father, and some of my father’s siblings. 

Phenomenal Calculator
My father’s great grandmother, the mother of Ajoke who is herself the mother of my father’s mother, worked in a market. My father tells me she was a phenomenal calculator. She could instantly count the change needed for market transactions and she had that rare ability to tell you what day of the week a random date in the future fell on. Her husband was some sort of imam for Lagos. My father says he remembers him clearly, because of what he told my father when my father was near four years old. My father was his great grandfather’s first great grandson and because of this apparently his great grandfather would give my father dimes whenever he was doling out nickels to his grand children. 

Not Sister but Mother
A funny story involves my father and his mother. He says that until he was eight years old he called his mother “sister”. He did so because he was the first born and grew up on a compound with many of his mother’s siblings and cousins. They always called her sister and as children are wont to do, he parroted what he heard in his environment and called her sister also. He was eventually set straight when Ajoke, his grand mother, told his mother to correct him.

Honesty about interests
I have been saying it for so long that I think I’ve forgotten that it is not really true. It seems that I’m not really interested in theoretical biophysics either. This is primarily because I’m not really interested in biology. Still the prospect of working in theoretical biophysics gave me a feeling that the prospect of working on the problems Professor Thaler proposed did not. I don’t know how to zero in on this prospect to specifically determine what I’m interested in, but at the very least I should stop lying to myself about my professed interest in biophysics.

About Wool
I finished reading Hugh Howey’s Wool yesterday morning. I really enjoyed the book. One particular element of it still reaches me. The characters of the novel live in a post-apocalyptic world which was intentionally created by some generation of people before them. And, in my mind, I can’t help but see something extremely cathartic in being able to look out at your world, see its problems, and then be able to unambiguously point to the parties responsible. In such a situation, you could then completely bypass the series of thoughts which would ordinarily lead you to the nihilistic conclusion that although the world seems to be in decay, this is simply the way the world has to be. You would know that the world need not be this way because you would know that this world was intentionally created. You could tell yourself and believe that the world could be made anew, that there is nothing immutable or at least inevitable in the life you and your fellow world citizens live. 

But maybe this depiction of the clearer sense of agency in a dystopian world functions specifically like an analogy and not merely as a fantasy. These man-made dystopian futures are like our own in that they were brought about by the decisions of men. How then could I honestly claim that a human sense of agency only legitimately exists in one?

Explaining the Loss
Another installment of the ongoing series. 
It was maybe four years ago that I lost the ability to appreciate the small problems in physics. And after this loss of appreciation of the smaller every day aspects of the subject came the larger loss of interest in physics as a subject of work. I often reflectively ask myself why I lost interest in physics, what happened to me, what did the institutions which were meant to protect my interest do to it. But it was not these institutions which twisted my formerly beloved work into an object of derision. I did that myself. 

It’s not exactly clear to me why I became so deeply unsatisfied with the every day thoughts and work in physics, but I have a few guesses. During this time, I felt that something missing was my life, some emotional or psychological nutrition which was absent from my diet. Physics being the main means through which my agency was expressed, thus became the means through which I sought these deficient qualities. Except I had no idea what was missing, or how to get it back. 

Now I cannot help but see deep truth in Feynman’s statement that there are no small problems in physics. In order to do work in the subject this has to be your perspective. My perspective was just the opposite and I ended up killing all interest I had in the subject. Everyday your enjoyment and sense of pleasure in what you do has to be replenished by the doing of it. You cannot put off your enjoyment till the end of the work and hope to have emotional fuel enough to complete it . The small acts of doing which bring you closer to your goal, need to be enjoyable too. 

I was trying to derive satisfaction from the planned extraordinary events of my life, when I should have been doing the opposite. I was living beyond the edge of the cliff because I felt the cliff wasn’t enough to see anything. But I should have tried to see beauty in the every day simplicity of physics, beyond any sense of validation I hoped it would give me. 

Let it go. This is progress if you le it be.

- I tried to derive from physics something I shouldn’t have

Lessons from Data Science Final Project
I completed the final project for Harvard’s CS109 course last month. As is customary, I think it’s a good idea to outline what I learned from the experience. 
Flexibility: Knowing when (and being able) to abandon the initial impetus of the project for one which is either clearly better or one which is simply more feasible given the conditions under which the project must be completed. 
The initial plan of my project was to explore the intersection between social media and video games by analyzing data provided by twitter and gaming web sites. During one frustrating Thanksgiving weekend I realized that I didn’t have the time/energy to collect the necessary twitter data. Over the next week and a half, I was able to devise a new project objective which was less technically sophisticated than the twitter analysis would have been but still quite interesting. 
It’s also necessary to learn to be OK with not getting exactly what you thought you wanted, and finding something worthwhile in what you find. Sometimes your external conditions preclude your seeking any profit; sometimes you only have the choice of how you will mitigate the costs. 

Utility of a Schedule: Creating a time line of when various aspects of the work need to be completed first ensures a more precise level of accountability and second allows you to have a larger temporal sense of your work. Expanding on this latter point, it forces you to not only think about the work you are doing today but the work which would necessarily come after it. Creating such a schedule is not fun and your find actively works to avoid doing it, but like most things the mind shies away from it is beneficial in the long-run. 

Difficulties of Data Gathering: Gathering data or putting data in a usable form is not always trivial and can often comprise the largest time commitment for the project. 
This point was difficult to appreciate in the CS109 because most of the data sets used for the homework assignments were already in prepared in a “ready-to-use” format. Consequently, I greatly underestimated how difficult and time consuming data gathering could be even when an API is available. In retrospect, this data gathering was rather fun because it forced me to think of creative ways to narrow my data set, get past Giant Bomb’s API rate limit, and determine which specific properties of video games were needed in the analysis.  Still. It was an unexpected time sink which almost stopped my analysis before it began. 

Good Groups: It’s not always better to work alone. Mediocre experiences working with other people have made me somewhat of a loner, and part of me was thinking about following that route for this project. But fortunately, I realized you could learn from other people. In the end I was extremely lucky in who I got as a partner. Aaron’s and my work complimented each other greatly. My somewhat fuzzy and large scale work on the low-hanging fruit of game development fit well with his much more technical analysis of text-classification to give the overall project a balanced presentation. 

Technical Sophistication: There is a place for knowing how to do technical and algorithmic things precisely and correctly. In the past I devalued the utility of techniques because I found that the techniques I had learned did not afford me the ability to answer the questions I wanted to answer. (I’m still struggling to understand how I got to such a place; my current guess is that I was learning these techniques for the wrong reasons or I tried to unartfully apply a learned technique in an improper context)
But the essence  of Aaron’s Naïve Bayes Classification analysis consisted of a precise application a technique in a context slightly removed from where he had first seen that technique applied. His successful adaptation of said technique and the specificity and clarity with which it was used in this new context has given me a new appreciation for those many textbook problems which seem to serve as mental calisthenics for decontextualized algorithms. One could see them instead as the preparation required to adequately learn a methodology before, one can adequately apply it somewhere new. 

Miscalculated Work Ethic: My ideas of what I think I can do in a certain allotted time do not sufficiently approximate what I can actually do in that time. Typically, I over estimate the energy I will have to complete work throughout the course of the day. I may start off strong but my energy eventually tapers off and I find myself half-assing and multi-tasking work which requires long-term concentration. In short I am much to optimistic about my work ethic. 
The first point: how long I can work changes depending on the type of work I’m doing. Right now, I can definitively state that I can do two hours of creative/generative work. This is work where given a topic/idea I create the outline which expands the idea and then I generate the material to fill it in. Writing an essay or a story falls into this category. For physics problem solving (that is problems which are posed by others), I can probably do something like 3-4 hours depending on where the problems fall on the generative/creative vs. algorithmic scale (fewer hours for problems requiring a creative solution). For transcription work (typing up latex notes, or hand written essays) I can do three hours. After these time estimates, my productivity begins to drop and the quality of my work does too. These time estimates need to be factored into any work schedule I create. 
Moreover, these mental exertions cannot be independently accumulated. Inevitably, any creative/generative work I do would leave me with less energy to do something like transcription, so that if I spend two hours writing a personal essay, I might be only able to spend an additional hour transcribing latex notes. 
And let’s not even mention the larger scale problem of assigning myself substantial amounts of work for a day and then finding myself at the end of the day with nothing done. This isn’t entirely accurate; I don’t merely find myself at the end of the day with zero work completed. My mind simply makes a semi-conscious acknowledgment that it does not want to work on this day, and I do nothing to fight it. 
These days crop up randomly, but they also seem connected to my mental endurance: it seems that I cannot do intense multi-hour work every day. Whenever I try to stretch a difficult work schedule beyond four or five days, there always comes a point where the aversion to work is so great that it cannot be discounted. Often, then, I would not only fail to do any work for the day in question, but also for many days afterwards until some small effort pushes me in a more positive direction. For the most part I’ve worked to ignore these lapses in diligence as just that, but they have occurred so frequently as to no longer honestly be considered anomalous. I’m thinking they are an inevitable consequence of concentrating on one thing for too long. It can also be a consequence of the undeniable (yet constantly denied) existential emptiness I feel in my work. I have no idea of a suggested fix. 
Examples from Recent Memory
The weekend of December 5-7. I had spent the prior week doing last minute data gathering for CS109. The CS109 process book was due on Wednesday, I had a Yoruba final exam on Tuesday, and I had a Stat Phys take home exam which was to be handed out on Tuesday also. I needed to study for Yoruba, and begin some data analysis over the weekend but I stopped working Sunday at 3pm and didn’t start again until Tuesday at 12pm, a few hours before my Yoruba final. 
Thanksgiving weekend. After watching a few of Anita Sarkeesian’s Youtube videos as background work for the CS109 final project, I fell into a state of dejection after realizing that a Twitter analysis would be to unwieldy. I ended up not working for the remaining portion of the weekend even though, I needed to begin the final Stat Phys pset and complete the exploratory analysis for Data Science. 

Language before Questions: there is a large advantage to understanding and being fluent in a technical language, long before you need to apply it in a practical context. After countless occasions in formal courses and on my own learning things I later concluded were useless, I posed the question of whether it would be better to only learn a technique when you have an explicit need for it. Since the techniques I was speaking of were exclusively mathematical, and mathematical techniques essentially compass a language, I phrased this as the “Language before or after Questions” problem. Should one learn the technical language before or after he meets a realistic question which requires it. “Both” is the characteristically diplomatic and unhelpful answer. “It Depends” is the even less helpful addition. 
For this project, it turned out to be exceedingly helpful that I already knew basic python commands and how to use these commands to create modular functions, before I began outlining my ideas. Moreover, these basic python skills were necessary to learn the higher level pandas syntax and commands which without question I needed to be competent in before I began the project. I don’t see how I would have even been able to formulate my question, had I not had this programming language somewhat firmly under my belt. 
However, there were also some tangential python/pandas modules and commands which I had never learned because I never saw them as important, until the project necessitated them. 
To resolve the dichotomy also requires one to understand something of the time scale that the question must be answered and the technical content it requires (two things which are never very clear at the outset) 
So, like most interesting questions, the answer isn’t clear-cut. Which approach is better depends specifically on the context. In my experience, you can be precise about it by bringing in time scales and content scales. Given the time scale I had to complete the project, it would have been somewhat unreasonable to expect me to go from zero experience in Python to a proficiency with which I could then learn pandas and conduct data analysis. However, that time scale was sufficiently long that I could supplement deficiencies in my Python knowledge with short online tutorials or answers on stack exchange. In short, any learning which requires you to master multiple hierarchies of knowledge over would be difficult to complete over short time scales, and hence if you need to answer a question quickly it is of course better to come with that knowledge already attained. 
But, also in my experience, being precise like this kind of kills the joy one gets from answering questions and learning. I think the better approach is to chase interests whether those interests lead you to learn something new or pose a question which requires you to learn something new. This is simply because it is your personal interest in a work which gives you the motivation to do the difficult work of either learning it fully or seeking out the other tools and techniques which would allow you to do so. 

Sometimes you’re not explicitly seeking any profit. Sometimes you’re just working to mitigate the costs.

Quotes from The Brother’s K
“
But it was that maimed little remnant of what had once been Papa’s great art form that has really stayed with me. There is a part of me that wants to state flat out that I learned more in the hedge about the defiance of dullness and career death, about the glory hidden in defeat, about the amazing inner capacities of a straightforward, no frills man – even a man stripped of hope – than I’ve learned anywhere since. 
“
pg.153

“
I could call it “detachment,” or “purity of effort,” or “a refusal to judge by results.” But as I watched from the hedge I felt no need to squeeze it into a formula. I was learning not by words like these but by Papa’s destinationless pitches out into the night, that there are genuine alternatives to the black-and-white categories into which most of us dump our lives. I was learning not by thinking, but through a father/son osmosis, that winning and losing success and failure, are like the chalk strike zones I’d watched Papa draw. There was no question that shedball wasn’t aimed at the Bigs, or even at the bush. It was just an oddball backyard hobby built upon the shards of Papa’s old baseball dreams and accomplishments. But while many ex-ballplayers hoard their shards, sucking on them and staining their lives with them the way Papa had done with his Lucky Strikes, Papa himself had finally crunched his shards underfoot, found a new and pure kind of effort to make, and commenced punching walls, swearing, joking, whistling and living his life as if the past had passed. And in the present he was surviving. Perhaps even thriving. He  didn’t know. It wasn’t his business to know. His business was simply to keep making the effort.

Maris was hardly the first technician to attain staggering fame through obsessive effort, only to later regret the cost. In his Autobiography—published a full century prior to Maris’s feat—Charles Darwin made a confession that reads like a manifesto of the One-Pointed Specialist’s inner condition: 

Up to the age of thirty, or beyond it, poetry of many kinds . . . gave me great pleasure, and even as a school boy I took intense delight in Shakespeare, especially in the historical plays. I have also said that formerly pictures [paintings] gave me considerable, and music very great, delight. But now for many years I cannot endure to read a line of poetry: I have tried lately to read Shakespeare, and found it so intolerably dull that it nauseated me. I have also lost almost any taste for pictures of music. . . . My mind seems to have become a kind of machine for grinding general laws out of large collections of fact, but why this should have caused the atrophy of that part of the brain on which the higher tastes depend, I cannot conceive . . . The loss of these tastes is a loss of happiness, and may possibly be injurious to the intellect.

Technical obsession is like an unlit ever-narrowing mine shaft leading straight down through the human mind. The deeper down one plunges, the more fabulous, and often the more remunerative, the gems or ore. But the deeper down one plunges, the more confined and conditioned one’s thoughts and movements become, and the greater the danger of permanently losing one’s way back to the surface of the planet. There also seems to be an overpowering malignant magic that reigns deep down in these shafts. And those who journey too far or stay down too long become its minions without knowing it—become not so much human beings as human tools wielded by whatever ideology, industry, force or idea happens to rule that particular mine. Another danger: because these mines are primarily mental, not physical, they do not necessarily mar or even mark the faces of those who have become utterly lost in them. A man or woman miles down, thrall to the magic, far beyond caring about anything still occurring on the planet’s surface, can sit down beside you on a park bench or bleacher seat, greet you in the street, shake your hand, look you in the eye, smile genially, say “How are you?” or “Merry Christmas!” or “How about those Yankees?” And you will never suspect that you are in the presence not of a kindred spirit, but of a subterranean force.

What is beautiful about The Brother’s K is that often in these tangents which are interesting and artfully posed yet seemingly irrelevant to the rest of the story one finds a lesson or an idea which explains what occurs later in the main storyline. In the part of the book where this quote lies, both Everett and Peter exist on the precipice to succumbing to a “technical obsession” in some form. Everett’s demon lies in his inability to intuit any more substantial reality to his beliefs and character beyond the self described farce he evinces to maintain his standing in college. It gets to the point where Everett, even as he realizes what he has become, cannot stop himself and finds it impossible to express anything authentic or non-ironic. He describes his situation the best when he says that a man living a life of farce, is living according to a script, and hence cannot be said to be human at all. 
 Peter’s flaw is his continual and repeated tapering of his world each time he experiences something disturbing. This flaw, much like Everett’s, initially manifested as a gift, a suggestion that Peter’s sensibilities were higher and perhaps more intrinsically human than those of his peers. This led him to religious texts causing him to delve deeper into the existential questions Christianity tried to carry on its lone shoulders, and in an effort to move deeper to the essence of the questions of life he traveled to India. But in India we find Peter indisposed to the customs he previously so believed he needed in his life. 
 
“
. . . when it comes to renunciation “no pain, no gain” is what I’ve slowly, reluctantly, inexorably come to believe. And when Pete opted for scholarly monkhood, I think he was just trying to outsmart his pain. The Peter who left for Harvard was not looking to integrate or balance his inner and outer selves: he was looking to trick his outer self into nirvana. He’d chosen a diet, not a leap into an abyss. He’d calculated that by considering the physical world “illusory” and burying his nose in metaphysical texts he could go on doing something comfortable while his ignorance and sufferings and hometown troublesome family just fell away like so much ugly excess poundage. 
   Obviously, I question his calculations: to slough off half a self in hopes of finding a whole one is not my idea of good math.

In other words, I had done to myself almost exactly what my sworn enemies in D.C. had done: I’d trapped myself in a script. The Megafarce script reduced me to either an expendable military part or a traitor to my country, while my own script puffed me up into a hero so essential to its own plot that on sunny spring strolls he was greeted as many as 207 times per two miles. But to be scripted at all is to be prepackaged, programmed, pinned to a page. 
	Only the unwritten can truly live a life. 
	So who I was, what I was, had to be unwritten.

There are kinds of human problems which really do seem, as out tidy expressions would have it, to “come to a head” and demand to be dealt with. But there are also problems, often just as serious, which come to nothing that we can recognize or openly deal with. Some long-lived, insidious problems simply slip us off onto one side of ourselves. Some gently rob us of just enough energy or faith so that days which once took place on a horizontal plane become an endless series of uphill slogs. And some—like high water working year after year at the roots of a riverside tree—quietly undercut our trust or our hope, our sense of place, or of humor, our ability to empathize, or to feel enthused, and we don’t sense impending danger, we don’t feel the damage at all, 
	till one day, to our amazement, we find ourselves crashing to the ground.

Insecurity
You have a very high sense of race consciousness. By that I mean, it is always present in your mind the way other people might see you and react to you due to your race. You know the way social culture has depicted people of your race and you know those depictions are not accurate representations of who you are, so in every interaction you’re on guard, attempting to modulate the way people treat you based on who they think you are versus the way you see yourself. 
And while it is true that some people will only see you in the superficial way based on stereotypes and past experiences, it is also true that not everyone will see you that way. And if you assume that everyone is going to react to you in that prejudiced way, and you put up walls of hostile indifference to protect yourself, you will lose the people who don’t come to you with those prejudices.

African Language Program Response

What is the best way to learn a language? What is the best way to learn something period? Schools pretend to know. I mean of course they should know right? They are in the business of turning the ignorant into the knowledgeable, of transferring the unknown realities of the world to those who wish to know them. So, supposedly schools should know all about what it takes to teach students things . But do they really (You said that already). 

ALP Reader Response (Written: 02-20-2015)

It is not merely true that the best way to learn something is to take responsibility for your own education; rather it is the only way to learn something. Institutional education often gives students a false sense of who carries the brunt of the goal to educate. Students, typically unwillingly, spend most of their lives in classrooms and consequently they can develop the sense that the only reason they’re there is because they are told to be. But this perspective on education, although wholly reasonable to someone who dislikes the subjects typically taught in such institutions, is antithetical to true learning. Because in order to learn anything well, one needs to take the time to explore and make connections on one’s own. That is, one needs to develop an ownership of the subject which cannot merely be attained through passive assimilation of another person’s (i.e. the teacher’s) understanding. 

This active and self-directed method of learning is essentially the approach that Izola took, and her success in learning multiple languages provides justification for it. In large part, it seems that all of Izola’s most important learning experiences occurred outside the formal contexts which comprise the majority of most students’ learning experiences. Traveling to a foreign country;  crating a language learning trajectory which is personally significant; writing a thesis in a newly learned languages. Each of these are activities that Izola engaged in of her own volition, but which also immensely contributed to her learning experience. From her story there is a simple lesson. If you want to learn a language, you cannot only depend on formal course work.

From the “One You Feed Podcast” Episode 065: Maria Popova of Brain Pickings 

“Interviewer: And I was like ‘I’m just going to make the show I wish I can listen to’ and there’s such a freedom in doing that and I’m just grateful to be able to have that mindset and I can almost always recognize it when I see somebody else who’s doing something…

Back to that, there’s a blend. None of us is so pure that it’s like “I don’t care what I put out into the world and whatever happens I have no preference.”

I don’t think anybody is that ideologically pure, but certainly for me the more that I can stay on the why I’m doing this and tying it back to what’s going on inside me the more of it remains something that gives me energy, gives me strength vs. the other way around. 

Maria Popova: Hmm. You know Austin Kleon…likes to say ‘Make the thing you want to see in the world. Write the books you want to read. Do the art you want to see. Make the music you want to hear.’ And I very much believe it, but I also think, really, what’s at the root of that is ‘Put the values into the world that you would like to see thrive and persevere.’ 

When you frame it that way then yes absolutely you’re doing it for yourself, but there’s also this element of I actually want to help other people live in a way that is somehow better.

A Drink With: Justin Simien Interview 2014 (http://adrinkwith.com/justin-simien/ )
Justin Simien: Just to get myself to just sit down and do the work, whatever that may be. You know I’m getting home at like 10, and publicity is very demanding job, I get home late but I know I have to crank out my pages and I know I have to set this goal for myself to have the next draft done. Just getting the work done in spite of the fact it’s not an easy sell. There’s no guarantee that even if you write a great script that anything will ever happen. 

Just talking myself through each stage of the process with no guarantee that it will amount to anything, that was the hardest thing. 

Inteviewer: So it doesn’t seem like there was ever a part where you felt like giving up. That wasn’t an option? 

Justin SImien: You always feel like giving up, but (laughs) the alternative is worse. Not doing something that I know I’m supposed to do. And I just felt in my heart and soul that I’m supposed to make this movie, and I don’t know how else to say it…

Emotion and the Artifice. 
The emotion came and you told it to be silent. For it came with a message and a noise, and while the message was difficult enough to accept, the noise was intolerable. So you didn’t wait with the emotion. You did not sit still as it made its case. Instead, you told it to stop and if at all possible to leave and never come again. But the emotion lived inside of you and it could not go elsewhere. So it stayed, but stayed chained to an artifice. An when an event came which would normally induce its appearance, the emotion struggled and writhed against the imposed constraints in your mind, but you were unmoved. The artifice however shifted slightly. And with each new event, came a new spastic jump of emotion, and an associated incremental loosening of the stones of the artifice. All of this was unbeknownst to you of course. You believed you had won. You believed that with emotion chained and dying in your cellar, you had finally defeated an enemy which had made vocal claims on your life. Never mind the interior of your abode decaying from indifference and disengagement. You had conquered the feelings which were unpleasant. What matter the cost?

But emotion, as it withered inside you and as it recognized your attempts to passively deny it the manifestation it required, decided that if it were to die a silent impotent death, it would not do so alone. And so with each new event and with each shift of the artifice, the foundation of your self began to powder, and soon the powder was dust, then stones, and then boulders. And before you knew it emotion had succeeded unintentionally in making good on it’s claim. The artifice had fallen to pieces and your life was soon to follow.

 I read that you have to let yourself feel your primary emotions. You shouldn’t try to suppress them, but that also does not mean that they should be faithfully responded to. Emotions, they say, provide information

I am trying to remember the specific points of a discussion Kanishka and I had this morning. He was explaining Neoliberalism to me and he eventually brought up an example which he stated proved why neoliberalism was unnecessary. He said that if a country like Venezuela could develop and produce its own natural resources (e.g. oil) then there is no reason for it to allow a foreign entity to enter the country and produce the resource even if they pay to do it. I argued that allowing a foreign entity to enter your country and produce your resource made sense if that country paid you more money than you could have made if you produced the resource yourself. Kanishka in turn said that I was confusing two issues. I think we disagreed about the purpose of production. I operated under the assumption that a country produces its goods in order to make money. Kanishka seemed to assume that the purpose of production is to provide goods to a country’s population. He said the only reason a country would logically agree to accept foreign investment into the means of production is if that country could provide technological resources which would make those means more efficient. He said my including money into the calculus of decisions was unnecessary because money was just a proxy for goods and services. 

I believed that infrastructure was something that a country could purchase with the money it obtained from foreign investment. Kanishka argued that the country could just sell it’s home-produced products in order to obtain the money to build infrastructure. 

In essence, he was saying there was no reason a country which can produce it’s own natural resource must accept foreign investments. The natural question, then is why do so many of them do. I wanted to ask this question but there was something else about his argument that I questioned. Something which I don’t remember at the moment and which this explication was supposed to (but did not) flesh out. 


The only reason this may be necessary is because since neoliberalism purportedly tries to create a global market, where exchanged are mediated with the American dollar, the country would need to accept foreign U.S. dollars to produce it’s own resource?

Lessons from Reasoning Minds Data Analysis Project
I finished the project Victor gave me about a month ago, and I have been putting off writing a post-script for long enough. Since the most difficult portions of the project were worked through weeks before the month and a half ago deadline, this post-script will partially be an exercise in memory retrieval. 

Initially Opaque, but over time less Murky: When I first obtained the data sets from Victor, I was instantly terrified by their lack of immediate interpretability. The questions Victor had requested that I investigate seemed so far removed from the data sets that I had no idea how to even begin working towards an answer. Of course, my initial response was to procrastinate, but after avoiding the work for a week or so, I decided to merely try to answer the simplest questions I could with the data set. These weren’t clearly related to the questions Victor wanted me to answer, but working through them made me less afraid of simply trying to deal with the data set. Also, answering these questions made me more familiar with the data so that I was soon able to see paths towards the questions Victor wanted me to answer. So, the lesson is that even data sets which initially appear uninterpretable can become more transparent over time as you play within them and answer simple questions with them. 
This suggests a more general lesson for working on projects whose objectives seem improbably far from the entry points available to you. Clearly, you can only begin at an entry point, but by familiarizing yourself with the technical and conceptual space around this entry point—most often by playing in this space—you can obtain enough of a footing to move beyond it and become slightly closer to the far off objective. Over time, by repeating this process and making incremental steps you can reach some worthy objective even if it’s not the one which initiated the journey. To affect this process, you need to 1) be willing to start at the places you can, 2) have patience with where you are, 3) have faith that you’ll get some place of value. 

The Intellectual Challenge of Data Wrangling: After years of working with theoretical models of nature, I developed an unconscious lack of respect for the task of putting data into a form in which it is interpretable through a quantitative or qualitative model. (Talk about the Quiz/Exam analysis section) 
Specifically, the form in which data is obtained may not be the form which is needed to answer a motivating question, and converting the data from the former type to the latter may be a substantial problem in of itself. 
One question for the Quiz/Exam section of the analysis was to determine how exam scores related to the lesson scores. The initial roadblock to answering this question was putting the data into a form in which exam and lesson scores for a student could be simply read off a table. In other words, I wanted to have individual students listed down a row and the students’ performance scores in lessons quizzes, or exams listed across a column. Thus a single cell would correspond to a particular student’s score in a particular lesson, quiz, or exam. 
It was difficult to put the data in this form because the original form of the data was very heterogeneous. In the original data set, a single row defined a single action in the Reasoning Mind interface, and specific columns corresponded to particular types of data which characterized the event. The actions were labeled with an integer index and across a row, you may have categories such as “LESSON”, “STUDENT”, “CORRECT”, etc. So in order to create the desired table, I had to first create a function which singled out the “STUDENT” and “LESSON” columns and used the “CORRECT” column to compute the particular student’s score for the particular lesson. Dealing with the quiz/exam scores were another challenge entirely. 
In all, the process of dealing with the data in its initial form and “massaging” it into something more useful was just as difficult as determining how to answer the larger question the data was supposed to help answer. 

Importance of Exploratory Analysis: Just as a method of familiarization, you will ask stupid questions at the beginning of your analysis, questions whose answers you most likely will not use in the final results. This is fine. But of course you will still have an intuitive sense of which questions you really want to answer, and the distance between the questions you currently can answer and the questions you want to answer may be so great as to be depressingly frustrating. 
Still, as I mentioned in “Intially Murky, but over time less Opaque”, this initial analysis is always necessary in order to familiarize yourself not only with the format of the data set and the questions it can answer but also with the methods which can best help you answer those questions. This preliminary analysis is typically exploratory and thus need not follow the clean outline of tasks necessary for a more involved analysis. 
The important thing in this case is just to concretely answer whatever question you can using the data, and to then use these initial answers to frame more specific questions. After a few cycles of this you should become sufficiently familiar with the data as to have an idea of how to answer your larger question. 


Bar Graphs without Error bars Don’t Exist: This is a tongue-in-cheek quote from Verena and is more specific than the other lessons discussed in this post-script. Quite simply, if you have data which can be represented in bar graph form, most likely that data includes some form of error or variance which must also be included with the bar graphs in order for them to have a less ambiguous meaning. Including these variances with the bar graph is an attempt to curb the “flaw of averages” mistake in statistics (i.e. explaining a range of data with only average results often provides an incomplete picture of the data). 

Concise, Quantitative, Declarative Sentences: When you are presenting the results of a data analysis to an audience, it’s important to present the results in the format of “least reducible cognitive units”. The audience in the short moments they are receiving your information cannot take the time to parse and interpret partial results, so you need to put your results into a form in which their meaning is manifest without interpretation. You do this by stating your results in short, declarative sentences which incorporate numbers. If you read some of Wolfram’s work on network analysis of Facebook data, or some of the articles on fivethirtyeight.com, virtually all of the results are presented in this way. 
I was unable to incorporate this presentation structure into my website report, but the power point for my talk follows this format more closely. Here are a few example sentences I use in my talk:

“On average, students in the 2014-15 school year scored 5 percentage points higher throughout the curriculum, than their 2013-14 counterparts in Harlandale.
“Within a lesson, the average student timed out on about 7% on an average question throughout the curriculum.”
“Typically, only one or two RH events within a lesson caused the majority of time outs.” 

The Utility of Decontextualized Problem Solving/Logic Puzzles: Although, I enjoyed them as a teenager, over time I became less enamored by the decontextualized problems and brain teasers which formed the crux of mathematics contexts and standardized exams. Back then my disillusionment grew because I eventually realized that problems that you would actually have to solve in work or general life related situations rarely come in such a well-defined and decontextualized form as they do in school. Now, I have the experiences to argue the counter-point that despite their artificiality these problems do have a role in making you more effective at solving more realistic problems. 
While it is true that I did not immediately encounter any “well-defined and decontextualized” problems in my analysis, many of the smaller problems I needed to solve in order to make progress towards answering some larger question, bared some resemblance to the exercises and problems I solved while working through “How to Think Like a Computer Scientist”. For example, many times I had to define a function to automate some procedure. To write the function I had to determine what I wanted the output to be given my available inputs, but afterwards building the function was an obvious act in problem solving. Of course, in these cases the problems were contextualized by the larger question I wanted to answer and I had to define them according to what I hoped to derive from their solutions, but I can still recognize the value in simply being able to solve these problems in a more prepared form. 
The following analogy (which I believe I’ve written out before) is apt in explaining the utility of these problems: The decontextualized and artificial exercises you solve in a textbook are like the calisthenics and drills you use to become stronger or more technically proficient in a sport. Of course, these exercises, even if they are fun to do, can have no larger meaning unless you use the skills they build in some large context. Playing or competing in an official game provides these skills with a larger context and your having built them gives you a larger toolbox by which to achieve any necessary objective. 

Skill of Problem Definition/ Question Formulation: I’ve been waiting and searching for some tangible post-academic life experience to justify my new found belief in the importance of the skill of question formulation, and I finally have it. 
As I mentioned in the above comment, this project has given me a newfound appreciation for decontextualized problem solving, but before I solved any problem over the course of my analysis, I had to define it sufficiently well so that a solution was possible. These problem definitions always extended from a desire to bridge some gap between where I was and where I wanted to be in my analysis, and I soon became well versed in translating a need into a problem statement which vaguely mirrored the problem statements I previously found in textbooks. 
	I don’t think it is presumptuous to claim that this skill is necessary for any large scale analysis. As a review, the process of formulating a well-defined problem is as follows: 

Larger Question -> Immediate Need -> Problem Statement to Address Need

That is, you begin with some large question you want to answer. From that large question, you acknowledge a need which must be addressed before any other progress in answering the question can be made. With the need acknowledged, you then express the need as a well-defined problem, that is, as a problem with a clear starting point and a clear objective. Finally, with the problem defined, you can then work solve the problem and by so doing fulfill the need. You repeat this process—noticing and addressing needs by defining and solving problems—until you sufficiently answer your larger question. 

	I went through this process many times while I was completing this project. One example, involved the Quiz/Exam analysis section. In order to develop a linear regression model which attempted to predict student Quiz/Exam scores given their lesson scores, I needed to first calculate the Quiz/Exam scores. The raw scores were not provided in the data set. Instead, for each Quiz/Exam there was a breakdown of the questions the students answered correctly or incorrectly. There were also scaled scores which were functionally useless because there was no clear way to tell how they were computed. For example, a data entry for a student’s quiz may look like 

“Q1A: 1, Q1B:1, Q2: 0, Q3A:0, Q3B:1, Q3C:0 ; Points = 67”

The “Points” were the useless scaled scores. The meaning of the question breakdown was as follows: there were two parts for question 1 and the student answered both correctly; there was only one part for question 2 and the student answered it incorrectly; there were three parts for question 3 and the student answered only one correctly. My goal was to use this question breakdown to compute a raw score for the student’s performance on this quiz. The problem statement could have looked something like this: 

Using the question-breakdown format exemplified above, write a function which takes this question breakdown and outputs a raw score. 

For the quiz, each net question was weighted equally, each part within a question was weighted equally, and the total weights of all parts summed to 1. So for the example above, Q1A and Q1B were both weighted .1666, Q2 was weighted .333, and Q3A, Q3B, and Q3C were each weighted 0.111. The raw score would be then 0.1666 X 1 + 0.1666 X 1 + 0.333 X 0 + 0.111 X 0 + 0.111 X 1 + 0.111 X 0 = 0.444. 

This is easy enough to compute on paper, but thinking of how to convert the string statement into something which was numerically interpretable was not easy. 

In this situation the Question-Need-Problem process looked like this: 

- How Do You Predict Quiz Scores from Lesson Scores
- Need to Convert Question Breakdown into Quiz/Exam Score
- Convert Question Breakdown into Quiz/Exam Score

Personal Aspects of The Project


Coping with Stress: Working on this project has showed me that I am very unskilled in regulating my own levels of stress. There were many times when, feeling overwhelmed by the amount of work seeming required of me, I would experience a breakdown and become incapable of thinking let alone doing any substantial work. This happened quite often near the beginning of the project when I was trying to balance the demands of the work with my classes. But even after I developed and maintained an explicit schedule of work, I often found myself on Friday nights vaguely beleaguered by thoughts of inadequacy and hopelessness. It was during these times that I would start eating uncontrollably, apparently trying to escape my feelings of worthlessness through the speed at which I consumed whatever was in front of me.            Strangely, these anxiety induced binge-eating episodes seemed to exist in harmony with an increased intensity in exercise. Over the span of this semester, although I arguably had less time to do so, I exercised more frequently and consistently than I had ever done since I practiced Taekwondo. I have always known that my mental state after a particularly challenging aerobic exercise is much clearer and stable than typical, and perhaps banking on this knowledge and constantly feeling under siege by an unclear mind, I turn towards exercise as a simple way to control my anxiety. But the high was always short lived and seemed to require more intense bouts to further sustain it. The result was that I would spend a night exercising to exhaustion only to still feel shitty, demotivated, and inadequate twenty four hours later. This would lead to binge-eating, thus justifying a more intense workout in the future and starting the process again.            All is not hopeless however. Recognizing, I had a problem and anticipating the seriousness of any further degeneration in will power, I signed up for therapy. It feels strange to apparently become an additional victim in our culture’s preoccupation with mental well-being but I think this was long-coming. One strategy, I’ve learned from the therapy is to sit with the feelings of inadequacy when they come instead of attempting to run away, and indirectly affirm them, from them through some self-destructive means. 


Outside Institution Work: Although it was a challenge to complete this project and my mental health suffered from my inability to adequately estimate the required demands and what was necessary to meet them, I am still glad I chose to do the work. Besides the explicit things I learned about managing a large project, working on it at the same time that I took classes seemed to clarify the kind of work I enjoy doing more so than if I had simply taken classes alone. It seems this is reminiscent of the time I studied physics on my own in high school. My high school mandated that all students take certain required courses and beyond these requirements students were given a modicum of freedom to define their own curriculum. But back home every night I was studying something which wasn’t required of me, and doing so during that year developed my internal agency and an interest in physics which clarified what I would do in college.            I think it is fair to say this is typical. Often when you find yourself operating within an institution, you find that your actions are constrained by the structure of the institution itself. You experience a greying away of a personal identity as you are influenced to act in ways consistent with peer behavior and the expectations of authority. Within this structure it is exceedingly easy to lose oneself, and lose sight of a personal drive which would lead to personally meaningful life goals. But if you can find some space of work which takes you outside of the institutional expectations, it becomes much easier to find that center which defines you and keeps you from the precipice of existential meaninglessness.            This semester, this “center” was found by working for a non-profit organization, as opposed to working alone in my room, and I think this represents an improvement in my own ability to make my ideas actionable. In the frame of Emerson: It is easy to be yourself, when you are alone; It is easy to abandon yourself in the midst of a crowd; But what is best and what is most difficult is to be yourself when in an environment which denies your values.           I think that is the most concrete point of this way-too-long bullet point: Do personally meaningful work outside of whatever institution surrounds you, but don’t simply work alone in your room. Strive to connect that work to some person, community, or group outside of yourself.

(Last Point)

The Importance of a Long-Form Schedule: At the start of this project, I was overwhelmed. It was a new semester, and I was trying to determine which electromagnetism class to take, debating what I should do about a research direction, and taking a stochastic optimization course which I was arguably unprepared for. After many days spent in my room, with the blinds drawn tight and the door firmly shut and my body hardly ever leaving the bed, I eventually realized that in order to complete the Reasoning Mind project and not fail all my classes for the semester, I needed to change the way I worked. 
	In the weeks prior, I worked rather thoughtlessly, only deciding what I would do on a day when I woke up to meet it. I obtained results, but unsurprisingly, the results were meager and somewhat rushed. Which was surprising given the vast amounts of free time I had during that January. Thus, at the start of the semester the change came in the form of an explicit weekly constructed schedule kept on Scrivener. Friday of every (or nearly every) week, I would create a list of my academic responsibilities and the objectives I hoped to complete in the project. As I would go through the week I would cross out the work I completed, and elaborate on the schedule where necessary. I would typically manage to complete all my academic work, but seldom did I ever finish the work I assigned myself for the project. This was OK, though, because simply having a schedule constantly informed me of how far behind I was in the project and hence how much work I needed to complete in order to catch up. 
	Often, when working on a small scale project it is OK to have vague ideas of the completion schedule of each aspect of it; if shit hits the fan, you know (or at least, believe) you can crank out the entire work before the deadline. Not so with a larger project. I was understandably terrified of the prospect of blindly working “just as much as I could” and then finding at the end of two months that I was far behind where I needed to be. 
	This schedule although built week to week did have a larger arc to it, and I think this is what gave my weekly work some deeper meaning. The schedule was constructed with the finished product in mind and each of the minor objectives involved completing some aspect of the finished product. Moreover, since the “product” consisted of webpages and code divided into half a dozen largely independent sections, I structured the work as to complete a section at a time so I could have a finished mini-product as soon as possible on which to model the other sections. 

Main Lesson: For large scale projects (like a book or contracted work, for instance), it is crucial to devise a schedule of work even if it is a schedule you cannot scrupulously maintain. 




Lessons from AM207 Class and Final Project

Personal Impetus vs. Borrowed Idea: I have always believed that it would be impossible for me to feel committed to working on a project that I did not choose to pursue for myself. This was one of those approximate truths which is valid often enough that a lazy mind can substitute a haze of gray for a line separating the black from the white. The Reasoning Mind project is the most recent counter example to this belief. I didn’t choose the project, but, sans the stress, anxiety, and mental instability I experienced, I did enjoy working on it. (That last sentence sounds more sarcastic than I intend). It taught me things about project organization, the utility of decontextualized problems, the importance of question framing. Not to mention it was an interesting exercise in large scale data analysis.  

I mention all of this because of what I was going to say about the AM207 final project. I was going to say I didn’t enjoy doing the final project because the project was essentially given to me from Verena. But this is an incorrect argument. The fact that I didn’t really enjoy completing the project is clear. Whether it was because the inciting idea was not my own is suspect. 

Instead, I think the project was such a slog because I was unable to find anything personally interesting about it. Because really, that’s what made the Reasoning Mind work so interesting eventually. Yes, I was working to answer the questions Victor wanted answered, but somehow I was also doing something that I found interesting, something which aligned with what I thought was interesting about the world. 

So, my advice here is that instead of placing all your work in a dichotomy of borrowed idea vs. personal idea, try to find something personally interesting in any work you have to do. If you can’t find something you believe is worth doing, then the work will not be enjoyable and the work will suffer regardless of if you think the inciting idea is your own.

Complications of Partner Work: I was so fortunate to find such a good partner in Aaron Meisner, that I was led to believe that working with a partner is almost always better than working alone. I may still hold this belief but I’m thinking of replacing the word “always better” with “sometimes”. It’s difficult to say what was different about working with Aaron compared to Rodrick, but it’s easy to say I dreaded the times I would have to meet with Rodrick. Maybe it was because Aaron was way more experienced than I was, and hence made most aspects of the data analysis breezily straightforward. His part of the project was largely appropriated from a homework assignment, but it was sufficiently well-defined that we (or at least he) didn’t spend too much time wavering about which direction to go. Maybe with Aaron I was working on the project with a minimal difficulty setting, and so when I started working with Rodrick, at a normal difficulty setting, it was inevitable that I would be unprepared for real partner work. 

The real difficulty was that we couldn’t get a really solid project definition off the ground. Verena gave us some starting points, but our general unfamiliarity with the techniques of the class made it difficult to turn these starting points into larger scale project ideas. We ended up waffling most of the time, and I (like I always do) made project promises that my work ethic and/or my abilities could not fulfill. In the end, I never really felt like the work came together. It just kind of skidded to a halt. Immaturely and wrongly, I blame Rodrick for this. But more honestly, I know I stopped really working on the project about two weeks before the deadline (I point to a semester of burning myself out each week, for this). And most honestly, I don’t think either of us were sufficiently familiar with the methods of the class to be able to           did not have the responsibility of another person’s grade on my shoulders. 

There should be a point to this. Working with people is complicated? True, but that could have been established without the paragraphs. How about this: Working with a partner may produce better work, but it still may not be work you’re proud of and for you Bolaji, sometimes the reasons for this are out of your purview of control. 

Completed Work As a Compromise: For this project, like in most of my projects, the objectives I started with were not the objectives I completed. In this case, it was more like I fell short of my intended objectives rather than fulfilling a different largely equivalent set, but I’m going to take this to be an outlier (to be honest, it’s more of a mode.)

I have said this many times, but I think it is something I should always remind myself of: completed work is always a compromise; a compromise between where you want the work to go and where it has room to go; a compromise between how much work you want to do each day and how much work you can reasonably do. You always have in your mind this ideal for the project, and every time you work, you do so in the direction of this ideal. But you need to recognize that although it can act as a useful compass, this ideal is pretty poor as a rubric. Your final work should not be judged by the naive objectives you decided upon when you knew the least about what you were going to do. 

Completed work is always a compromise, and you need to shift your focus away from trying to achieve every little aspect of your vision for the work and towards simply completing it and letting it develop in the directions it suggests. 

Be present, be receptive, be engaged. Don’t be controlling. 

Listen and hear. Look and see. Don’t replace an image of what is there, with what you want to impose. Be motivated by a question, but don’t be chained to it. 

Your motivating question is rarely, the question you end up answering. This is OK. This makes sense. 

Combining Disparate Ideas:  The crux of my part of the project consisted of combining two classical problems in stochastic optimization. And although the combination of the two problems proved interesting, it also seemed somewhat empty, as though I were performing an intellectual exercise. The problem I think was that although I claimed to have made the combination in order to answer a question which required elements of both of optimization problems, the question itself was so limited in scope and so purely technical that the answers I found didn’t seem interesting enough to justify the investigation. The question I attempted to answer seemed half-formed. It was concrete, yes, but it seemed to lack good justification, because the actual real world justifications proved to be too difficult to incorporate into the assumptions of the problem. 

I have often read and often parroted the claim that creativity consists of combining different ideas. Putting aside the question of whether creativity should be pursued for its own sake we have the related question of whether simply combining different ideas is enough to create something new and justifiably relevant. I think something more is required. 

One cannot only combine different methods or concepts, close his eyes, and hope for a good outcome. He needs to ensure that the combination is purposeful, that it answers a real question which would have been difficult to answer in another way. 

Importance of Narrative Relevance: Related to the failed microscopic combination of ideas affected in my part of the project, more macroscopically Rodrick and I failed to adequately integrate our individual contributions. This really seemed to be a major reason why the project never felt like it “came together”; quite literally it never did. Finding it difficult to come up with a single large question which yielded enough work for two people, Rodrick and I simply decided to work on two different questions which used somewhat related data sets. The methods we used for each of our questions were similar, but the fact that the larger questions were distinct and arguably disconnected made our project feel like an ill-thought out mixture of two projects. 

I have always recognized the basic importance of a narrative in an investigation. More deeply, I now realize that although answering many questions can be the starting point for an investigation, it is never enough to just stop there. There must be a sensible narrative which justifies the questions and flows naturally from one to the next. This narrative does not need to be known before the questions are answered individually. But after the questions are answered one certainly needs to do more work (either by eliminating extraneous elements or conducting smaller investigations in the gaps defined by the main questions) to ensure that the narrative is apparent and continuous. 

Time Constraints DO NOT Abridge Thinking: 

While working on the project, a new question or a new approach would pop into my head only to be denied further thought because I knew I did not have enough time to follow through with it. I had to work on the bare bones of the project, the aspects which were needed to make the project submittable, and I could not devote too much extra thought to any other matters, not at least, while the clock was ticking. 

Of course, if I more scrupulously managed my time and my energy I could have been able to pursue these detours. Still, I think this sense of an unfulfilled possibility will inevitably mar any project. It is technically impossible to escape time constraints, because any finite piece of work will be completed in a finite period of time. But then again, there are always areas of the work which could be improved or extended. 

Here, again, is another compromise of a completed project. You have a deadline to meet, and because of that deadline you cannot complete all the work which can be completed in a project. Still, this inability does not suggest that the work you are able to finish is incomplete or inadequate. It only means that there is more to be done. 

Time constraints do not abridge thinking, they demarcate it and exist as stopping and starting points for continued questioning. 



On Data and Theory: When I started learning about and trying to develop mathematical models outside of physics, I would always find after I derived the equations of the model that the model felt empty and incomplete. It was as though I was merely playing with a toy version of something real, and the real thing lay frustratingly inaccessible. Eventually, I concluded that the source of this ‘incompleteness’ was the fact that I was only dealing with abstract models which were disconnected from any real life situation which could justify them. I think this was part of the reason I took a course in data science. Years spent manipulating variables and integrals, without any clear sense that what I was doing was connected to something in the world made me hunger for something which was quantitative yet manifestly  concrete. Of course, in physics the relevant data lay in tables and can be found with some effort, but for more pedestrian models it’s more difficult to get a sense that your model is connected to something real unless the associated data lie before you. 

For this project, however, I have seen the other side of that divide. It is not always true that a model constructed with respect to some data source will feel more real than one which is abstractly defined by variables alone. Even with data, models can feel contrived and irrelevant if the model is not defined by any larger question you hope to answer. 

One could argue that the data source I used for the AM207 project was lazily chosen. It wasn’t raw data, the kind of data which requires the analyst to sift through it and understand what is relevant for the question he is trying to answer. It was pre-digested data, presented in a format used to answer a question I was not really concerned with. And so in order to use the data, I had to modify my question to fit its presentation, and perhaps this was the reason the model built from the data felt contrived. 

I still believe one requires both for a good model: theoretical abstraction and a good data source. But it is not merely true that having both in an analysis will automatically generate a reliable model. One needs to define his or her question a part from the data sources available, and then work to find data which can help to answer one’s question. And moreover, while one does so, one cannot take the easy route and use pre-digested data but should use data in its most raw form. This is not only to ensure that the data is relevant and accurate to the question you’re trying to answer, but also to clarify in your mind all parts of the data manipulation process.

Our habitual narratives about technology begin with respectful disparagement of what came before and move on to idealize the new. So, for example, online reading, with its links and hypertext possibilities, often receives a heroic, triumphalist narrative, while the book is disparaged as “disconnected.” That narrative goes something like this: the old reading was linear and exclusionary; the new reading is democratic as every text opens out to linked pages—chains of new ideas. But this, of course, is only one story, the one technology wants to tell. There is another story. The book is connected to daydreams and personal associations as readers look within themselves. Online reading…always invites you elsewhere.

The Conjurer
The conjurer begins by attempting to elicit a new feeling. Something unlike all that has been expressed before. Its novelty gives it an immediate power in the mind, grabbing the conscious observer and pulling him away from any previous occupation. Like a leaf in a gale storm, he is pushed and directed by forces he lacks the resources to comprehend. And when the prelude ends, the real show begins. After the wind comes the clouds and with the clouds comes the rain and the electric currents surging from the sky. We have all observed such things, but few can be parties to them. But often, what we create when we loose it upon the world metastasizes and grows in ways we never could have foreseen. What is conjured forgets its origins, forgets the intention of its creator and begins to live a story distinct from the original tale. You listen, and although the base notes can still be perceived, they are obscured by the denouement you see without effort. The creator’s task is nevertheless fulfilled; his audience has taken what he has made, and through the idiosyncrasies of their own vision they have changed it, multiplied it, and turned it into something greater than his efforts alone could have achieved.

When we are smaller than ourselves
There are moments when we are smaller than ourselves. When, in the same way that cognitive worlds contract, our morality and standards of conduct recede and we begin operating deep within the margins of our typical generosity and kindness. What causes this is not merely indifference. True, apathy superficially can be seen in abandoning former mores of conduct, but beyond the emotional content of the actions there is a reason a world which previously had meaning to an individual loses that meaning and becomes something else. It is this shifted world that causes people to forget who they were, forget who they wanted to be, forget who they can become. 
	But of course, the world has not changed; it is only that one’s experiences have been augmented. And through some combination of nature and choice, from these experiences one abstracted a new set of general principles of living which colored the world as more gray, less worthy of preoccupation. When you begin to no longer care about what you say or what you do, the world patiently works to confirm your nihilism. The shade spreads, leaving your room and seeping into the hallway which connects your door to the street. Soon your entire city is blanketed by the feeling and your mind makes the natural extrapolations. 
	Your memories next. Purity and fondness are lost as the past is placed in the new context which you defend as correct because you apparently have only now obtained the ability to see. What defines a man at such a point? What defines him at any point? There is a philosophy which can be inferred from a man’s actions, a philosophy more true and robust than what he tells himself he believes. To find the definition of such a man who has experienced a graying of the world, you need to look at what he does, not at what he claims to think. For some, the process has not yet been completed and they continue to work and aspire as though they still believed the world had meaning, and of course some, potentially growing, part of them does still believe. But in others, the new vision of the world runs deep, and they walk and talk and act without animation. They neither attempt to enlarge their world nor escape from it. They exist in purgatory with time made irrelevant and only defined as a scale of decay. 
	For how long does this smallness last? It can go on unimpeded, eating up years like seconds, but it is not true that those of us experiencing this reduction of self have no control in the matter, although this new self will struggle against this faith. It is difficult to recognize your agency when the world you live in so consistently denies it. Still, in this way, habits can save just as often as they can destroy. You run headlong into a world which resists any intelligent attempt at engagement, and so you return to a less purposeful and more automatic mode of acting, hoping that when you re-emerge you will find a space where your actions produce results. Whether they do depends on what that mode fundamentally is.

The First Planned Meet Up
When he emailed me yesterday, I didn’t want to do the video chat anymore. For a few days I had been developing the sense that he wasn’t really into it. The correspondence had been somewhat one sided, with me responding within an hour to emails which would take him about a day to return. One narrative painted him as the ever busy yuppie. A less naive, if more cynical, narrative simply painted him as uninterested. And now here he was somewhat late to a meeting he suggested. Forty minutes past nine, he emailed me saying we could still do the video chat today, if I was around, but that it would have to be soon because he had to go to bed early. Otherwise, we could do it Friday night or some time Saturday. Reactively, I wanted to tell him we should do it some other night, but then I thought that if this thing wasn’t going to happen, I would rather know earlier than later. So I told him to give me ten minutes. 

I was surprised when his image first popped up on the Skype window. I don’t know if it was the overshadowing connotations of a Craigslist hookup or my own selective and inaccurate preconceptions of the spectrum of faces East Asian men have but he was more attractive than I imagined he would be. After sometime, I realized he looked somewhat like the online images I saw of Philip Tanedo. Strangely, this fact is more disconcerting now, than it was in the moment. You often think about meeting your heroes, what you will say to them, and what advice they’ll give you about your own aspirations. But rarely do you ever fantasize about sleeping with their dopplegangers, and when the prospect presents itself the seriality can be so great that you don’t immediately recognize the strangeness of it until it’s long over.

But this is really far from over. It hasn’t even begun, and if the field reports in this arena of male sexuality are to be believed the odds are against it ever happening. And so I am trying to temper my expectations. I imagine the worst case scenario is that he never emails me his address, or he emails me a wrong address, or he emails me the correct address and doesn’t answer the door. These are the musings of a weak and insecure mind. I try not to give that part of myself too much license over my attachment to things. But in moments like these, when a long stifled desire obtains a glimpse of its fulfillment and subsequently runs wild imagining the sickeningly sweet possibilities, it’s nice to have a counterweight to balance the expectations.

So it didn’t happen. You know this already. You may have forgotten the details though. The plan was he would email me during the weekend to let me know his address. But instead on Saturday afternoon he emailed me letting me know that Sunday night was no longer a good time because he had a roommate coming in. He asked if I could do Sunday afternoon between 3 and 5 pm. I thought this was a strange choice of time for what we were planning to do, but in truth I was available. 

During the TF meeting on the Friday before we were supposed to meet, all the TFs had to schedule their office hours. TF’s could volunteer for any session they wanted, and I initially chose a Sunday 3-5pm session to ensure my Sunday night was free. But through some reshufflings, my time was changed to Tuesday 7-9pm. So, yes, I was free on Sunday from 3-5pm. But I told him I wasn’t because I didn’t want to do anything in the middle of the day. In the same email that I told him I was unavailable I asked him if he could make it Saturday night (that night), or later in the week, and that was the end of our correspondence. He never emailed me back. 

Initially, I took it in stride telling myself that he owed me nothing, that this had happened before and nothing at all guaranteed that it would not happen again. I would be OK, I told myself. This will not change me. But it was a lie. 

That experience and some other bad experiences talking with body-less faces in chatting apps, made me lose my religion. I mean here I was operating according to a value system whose utility was supposed to be universal, and yet I was constantly finding environments which proved that my values were irrelevant. Respect, compassion, empathy. Do these qualities and attributes still have a measure of worth if they fail to help you live a better life? If living according to these qualities makes you constantly a victim, makes every new venture simply a new opportunity for pain? Who then can blame you if these values are abandoned? 

There is a narrative to this that I have alternately embraced and abandoned. A narrative where the roles stay the same but the actors change, drifting on and off the stage like understudies at a rehearsal. It is only now that I remember Christine and Sarah and Stephan and Lesley and Jessica. But even before this recollection, I made a decision to change how I lived my life. Finding my value system make contact with a reality which seemed to deny its relevance, I realized that the value system was not my own. It was something I borrowed from a book, from society, from a source distinct from my own experiences. Perhaps it was not necessary to be honest and upfront with other people. Perhaps it was not necessary to be vulnerable in the hopes of obtaining true attachment. Perhaps people need not be respected and treated as human beings. Perhaps they could be taken as the abstractions they paint themselves as. Perhaps I need not be concerned with another person’s pain. 

Such are the thoughts of a sociopath, and this was a pathology I decided to fight no longer. In the days following the incidents I wrote many posts on CL pretending to be someone I was not. The goal was to try to get as many people as possible to feel what I felt, that sense of loss at having been denied the acknowledgment deserving of a human being. 

-- I had to stop writing it was getting to be too self pitying.

If you’re going to write a story about it you should get the reality right. Elizabeth hung out with him ever before the incident. She did continue to do so afterwards, but she also said he was an asshole if that means anything. The way I would write it is that the girl doesn’t stop hanging out with the guy after the incident, but there is a cooling off. Smile and wave in the hallway, but now when he calls for a drink at night she tells him she’s busy. 

Ways that I killed my interest in physics
- Telling myself that the work I could do was unimportant, and that only  some other work was significant.
- Learning and studying physics because it made me feel vaguely superior to other people.
- “ “ because it made me feel smart
- “ “ because I wanted it to provide existential validation for my life
- Learning physics because I wanted to imitate the lives of the people I read in biographies
- Following a script of what I had to do in order to become a great physicist
Working and learning topics I felt I had to learn 
Focusing only on the end result and failing to appreciate the small steps of progress

“It’s a piece of advice given by the German Romantic Ludwig Börne. ‘For three successive days, force yourself to write, without denaturalizing or hypocrisy, everything that crosses your mind. Write what you think of yourself, your wives, Goethe, the Turkish war, the Last Judgment, your superiors, and you will be stupefied to see how many new thoughts have poured forth. That is what constitutes the art of becoming an original writer in three days.’ ”

July 19, 2015

I have listened to hundreds of podcasts in the past year, and yet when I try to reflect on the details of the ones I most remember, I’m left with the fuzzy outlines of a story with nothing specific to point to. I think this poor memory might be because of the way I listen to these stories and the rate at which I listen to them. So I’m trying something new here. For most of the podcasts I listen to I’ll try to write down a short summary of the main story and maybe something about my reaction to it. 

The Education of Little Tree
This podcast began with the description of a book. The Education of Little Tree is a story about an Indian boy whose parents die and who is then made to live with his grand parents. His grand parents teach him many things about how to live in harmony with nature, such as not taking more resources/food than you need, and how to treat other people with kindness and respect. The story seems to be in that large genre of children’s books which have some moralistic message.  The Giving Tree is another book of this type that comes to mind. A high school student who had been assigned to read the book states he very much identifies with the main character because like the boy he wants to better himself. The podcasts narrator then states that The Education of Little Tree is claimed to be an autobiography of the author’s own life and thus is supposedly a mirror to the lessons he learned from his own grandparents. But it turns out that this is a lie. 

The podcast then seemingly takes a non sequitur towards George Wallace. George Wallace was the Governor of Alabama during the Civil Rights movement of the early 1960s and is most famous for a speech he gave with the memorable lines “Segregation Now, Segregation Tomorrow, Segregation Forever.” However, these lines were not Wallace’s own. Asa Carter, Wallace’s speech writer and a poet laureate of (Alabama?), penned the famous words, and the podcast claims that while Wallace was actually ambivalent about segregation in the south, Carter was the true hard liner. Carter deeply hated negroes and once tried to organize an attack agains Nat King Cole because he didn’t like the idea of a black man singing to white women. He also hated jews and hated the supposedly corrupting influence they were having on America. The description the podcast gives is that Carter believed that if “Negro music” was a virus in America, Jewish producers and businessmen were the syringes injecting the virus into the American body. 

As Wallace grew older and his views on segregation did a complete about face, he apparently distanced himself from Asa Carter. This was around the 1970s when Wallace went on an apology tour to black communities and establishments in Alabama. This is where the story switches to an apparently new character. 

I can’t exactly remember the location where Forest Carter is introduced, but he is introduced in the context of a couple. The couple met an affable and social indian man by the name of Forest Carter, and Carter told them many stories about his youth and upbringing. The couple conveyed the fact that they thought Carter was an incredibly open and kind man and they were glad to have known him. Forrest Carter eventually wrote a book describing his earlier life and this was the book first introduced in the podcast: The Education of Little Tree. After talking about the various tours, Carter went on to promote the book the podcast introduces a previously introduced character who claimed to have seen and recognized Carter from one of his TV appearances. This man stated that Forest Carter got a tan and lost maybe 20 pounds, but he was indeed the one and the same Asa Carter. 

The podcast then presents various audio snippets of people talking about whether Asa and Forest are the same person, with the verdict eventually falling on the fact that they are one and the same. Finally, the narrator of the podcast ask how is it possible that someone as deeply racist as Asa Carter could have written something so seemingly open and positively moralistic (by our modern standards of morality) as the book penned by Forest. Three theories are floated in this regard. The first, supported by lovers of the book, is that like Wallace in his later years Carter’s views on race and the world softened and resulted in the more inclusively philosophy shown in the book. The second theory, is that Carter did not change at all and simply wrote the book as a mockery of liberal left. The third theory, presented by Carter’s long time friend Roy Taylor, is that Carter neither had a change of heart nor did he write a tongue-in-cheek book. Instead, The Education of Little Tree is entirely consistent with Carter’s previous views and that it is only readers who are interpreting the book such that it conflicts with those views. 

This last theory seems to be the best supported as Roy Taylor presents the podcast interviewer with a signed copy of The Education of Little Tree which has some inscription to the effect “To Taylor, one of the last soldiers still fighting with me for the southern struggle.”

The podcast narrator seems to reject this, theory, however. He mentions reading the book to his daughter and not being entirely sure how to interpret some passages. There’s a passage in which the grandparents explain to their grandson that it’s OK that a hawk killed and ate a bird because nature functions to improve itself by allowing only the strong to live and reproduce. Is this a passage merely explaining the cycles of nature, or is this a veiled justification of the attitudes which frame white supremacy. The narrator is not absolutely sure, but he seems to understand that most people walk away with the former interpretation. He then facetiously concludes by stating that the Asa Carter would certainly have hated this book written by Forest Carter.  [//]

Willpower is Ambiguity Itself 
I have just started reading James Baldwin’s Giovanni’s Room, and it’s incredible. I’m enjoying it so much more than I am Go Tell It on The Mountain. There’s something about the way Baldwin crafts the sentences in the GR so that they’re simultaneously lyrical, precise, and insightful. Check out this passage from the end of the first chapter. 

For I am—or I was—one of those people who pride themselves on their willpower, on their ability to make a decision and carry it through. This virtue, like most virtues, is ambiguity itself.

What does he mean by this? How is willpower “ambiguity itself”? Perhaps, it’s because people’s sense of control cannot help but be tied to the circumstances they are trying to control. And it is of course possible to live your life such that the challenges and potential chaos you face lie well within your spectrum of agency. You would thus find great utility in your willpower, but this willpower, seeing as it was never truly stretched or contested, can never be conclusively claimed to exist in the way you think it does. 

People who believe they are strong-willed and the masters of their destiny can only continue to believe this by becoming specialists in self-deception. Their decisions are not really decisions at all—a real decision makes one humble, one knows that it is at the mercy of more things than can be named—but elaborate systems of evasion, of illusion, designed to make themselves and the world appear to be what they are not. 

The decisions a strong willed person makes paint the world as less unruly than it truly is. It is in this way that such a person maintains their sense of control and power. How does this painting proceed?

This is certainly what my decision, made so long ago in Joey’s bed, came to. I had decided to allow no room in the universe for something which shamed and frightened me. I succeeded very well—by not looking at the universe, by not looking at myself, by remaining, in effect, in constant motion. 

David attempted to sequester from his world any possible recurrence of the experience which originally made him question himself. He seemed to do so unconsciously, by simply blurring his eyes against self reflection. 

What happened was that, all unconscious of what this ennui meant, I wearied of the motion, wearied of the joyless seas of alcohol, wearied of the blunt, bluff, hearty, and totally meaningless friendships, wearied of wandering through the forests of desperate women, wearied of the work which fed me only in the most brutally literal sense. 

Another beautiful passage in its entirety, but what jumps out at me is the last sentence. I interpret it as meaning that the jobs he held over the years supplied him with the funds to buy food for sustenance and nothing more. The work was not meaningful to him outside of this bare utility. What is interesting is that this approach to work seemed to be a reaction to his attempt to control his life by subtracting from it the experiences with which he could not positively identify. Strangely, by amputating a part of his identity, and claiming that a previously affirming experience really was not ‘who he was’, he may have also cut off his ability to recognize and pursue work which could be personally fulfilling. 

Perhaps, as we say in America, I wanted to find myself. This is an interesting phrase, not current as far as I know in the language of any other people, which certainly does not mean what is says but betrays a nagging suspicion that something has been misplaced. I think now that if I had had any intimation that the self I was going to find would turn out to be only the same self from which I had spent so much time in flight, I would have stayed at home. But, again, I think I knew, at the very bottom of my heart, exactly what I was doing when I took the boat for France. 

 Is what he says in the first few sentences true to life? Is it true that when people endeavor to find themselves, what they are truly looking for already resides within them? A personal identity denied so consistently and for so long, that one can no longer see it from introspection but can only perceive it, somehow, reflected back at one from the outside? In honesty, when I went to New Orleans two years ago, it was both as a respite and as an attempt to return to a mode of work I felt I lost at MIT. So yes, it was an attempt find again something seemingly misplaced, but was I trying to “find myself”? I suppose when you travel halfway across the country in attempt to find that former peace- and confidence-giving alignment with life, even the unctuously overused “trying to find yourself” is an appropriate description.

“The RET theory of depression states that when people merely wish, prefer, or desire to achieve goals (such as succeeding in school, work, or relationships) and when they fail to do so and think they will continue to fail, they will tend to feel distinctly…sad and regretful but not depressed. When, however, they consciously or unconsciously escalate their desires and preferences into absolutistic demands and commands and powerfully convince themselves that they should, ought and must…achieve the sucess and approval they desire, they then make themselves depressed.
…
In the RET view, sorrow or sadness vary in intensity from 1 to 99, but depression goes off the regular intensity scale and ranges from 101 to infinity.”

As I see it, pride (rather than sexuality and hostility) is the nonacceptable central core or dynamic force of our lives…Further, I would like to hypothesize that both depression and suicide derive from this secret pride or grandiosity… .
	To those self-pitying souls who experience the allegedly universal “existential despair,” which is seen to justify suicide, I would say that such despair or self-pity comes only when people cannot reconcile themselves to not being God—with all the answers—and when they refuse to accept their finite humanity.

“Here are several indications of musts creating or inciting anti-empirical cognitions.

When disturbed people feel hopeless and helpless about the future—“Because I got rejected by this partner, I’ll never enjoy a good relationship with any good partner—they probably do so because they believe: “Since I must be thoroughly competent in relationships and must never get rejected, and since I flouted this law of the universe and did act incompetently and did get rejected, in the future I will still always be incompetent and rejectable (as I must not be!) and therefore I will never enjoy a good relationship with any good partner.”

Finding What Was Lost

When I walked into Conant, I saw the stack of books I had seen that morning and days prior. It contained novels mostly by black women authors (Zadie Smith’s White Teeth, Morrison’s Song of Solomon and Love, Zora Neale Hurston’s Fiction Collection, a few novels by Edwidge Danticat). Completely out of character to the collection, I also saw Paul Graham’s dry biography of Paul Dirac. I had picked up Song of Solomon and a book by Edwidge Danticat but, out of greed or deeper curiosity, I wanted to ensure the stack had no other treasures remaining. And this is where it all started. 

Before I came back to Conant, I had gone to the Science Center homework boxes to pick up the last set of homework for Phys-S1a. I then went to my office in G2 to pick up my notebook, Investigations: Alpha and the books We Own the Night and The Autobiography of Malcom X. After I entered Conant, and after I perused through the stack of literature near the entrance, leaving empty handed, I went up stairs to my room. 

For the next hour or so, I ate toast and crackers, drank cranberry juice and sparkling water, watched the last episode of American Crime, and took a nap. It was only after I woke up from my nap, 15 mins before my meeting with Ricardo, and I looked for the papers that I intended to grade later that day, that I realized something was amiss. 

The papers I needed to grade were missing. Reactively, I began searching my room, going over it multiple   times a task which was quite easy to do, since my move earlier in the day had made the place quite sparse.  So I checked outside my room as well. I checked the kitchen tables and shelves. I checked the table on the floor’s landing. And, nothing. I didn’t find the papers anywhere. But after some time I realized my lost items extended beyond these papers. My notebook and the books I took from my G2 office were gone as well. It was at this point, after retracing my thoughts, that I realized that although I remember having these items right before I entered Conant (there was a photographic image in my mind of me drumming my fingers on the notebook as I walked), I had no recollection of my having them afterwards. So I surmised that I must have lost them in the entryway. 

I ran down four flights of stairs to the entryway, hoping to see the bright blue notebook staring up at me. But all I saw was the same stack of books that I looked through an hour before. That and my copy of The Autobiography of Malcom X. Seeing the copy lifted my spirits. Surely if the book were here the other items had to be nearby. The stack of books and TAMX were on a radiator right at the foot of the stair to the first floor landing. I searched around the radiator and found none of my other items. Finding no graded papers and no notebook, I had the rather stupid idea that I maybe left TAMX near the building’s entrance, but took the rest of the items to my room, and I just had not seen them during my initial search because it was poorly done. (I actually do this a lot; I will search a place half a dozen times because my mind fails to adequately retain the memory of each individual search). So I ran up stairs to fruitlessly search again all the places I had searched before. 

By this point is probably 5pm and I was officially late to my meeting with Ricardo. I decided to go to my meeting and determine what to do about these missing items later. 

As I was packing my books and laptop, I found it incredibly difficult to think clearly. The anxiety from losing my notebook and ungraded papers was seeping in, clouding my mind, making it difficult for me to remember what I needed to pack. When I walked down the stairs I tried to equilibrate my breathing, and move slowly, hoping my mind would take on the features of my physical motion.

I met with Ricardo at six past five, and showed him his exam. As he quietly looked through it, I thought to myself about what next I needed to do to find the missing items. I decided that since I exhausted all the reasonable searching places, someone must have taken my items or at least moved them somewhere else. So I began drafting an email to Hayley, asking her about sending a hall wide email to Conant concerning my missing notebook, graded papers, and book. In the email, I told her that I believe the items were taken or thrown away, the latter of which only popped into my head after I realized it was only my narcissistic persecution complex which led me to believe they were stolen. 

After I met with Ricardo, I sent the email to Hayley and tried to push the matter out of my mind. I intended to go to a classroom in the Science Center in order to start grading the papers I had with me, but then I had the idea that perhaps the papers were taken by a janitor and placed in one of the janitorial closets. I debated whether I should return to Conant or stick to my plan of grading the papers now, and return to Conant later, but I ultimately decided that if I was to find the lost items I would rather find them sooner than later. 

Back in Conant, I checked the Janitorial closet on the first floor. Nothing. For good measure, I checked the kitchen and the two lounges on the first floor. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. So I went up stairs, checking the closets on each floor, finding nothing in each of them, and growing increasingly disillusioned. On the fourth floor, for one final good measure, I decided to check my room and the kitchen again, and even the bathroom. Clearly, I was quite desperate. My last good idea was to check the trash and the recycle bins. Perhaps, I thought, to an untrained eye the loose stack of ungraded papers looked like an unwanted item and was thus deserving of the compost heap. Starting on the fourth floor, I checked the trash and recycle bins on each floor, finding (again) nothing. But when I reached the first floor, inside the recycle bin I saw the vaguely reminiscent hand writing of one of my students. Opening the bin, I saw my notebook, all the ungraded papers, and Johnson’s book scattered inside. 

To say I was relieved would be understating my feeling. In the minutes prior, feeling my anxiety reaching an uncomfortable level, I had decided to begin mapping out a contingency plan. What would I do if I never found the items? Johnson’s book, a 23rd birthday gift from my sister would be an unfortunate loss, but would have been the least emotionally weighty (not because I don’t love my sister, but because books are replaceable). For the graded papers, I had considered giving my students all perfect scores, or simply copying their scores for previous assignments, but I ultimately decided both of these approaches were tacky and showed a lack of character. I instead resolved to be upfront about the issue, telling Louis first that the HWs were thrown away (not, mind you, that I had lost them) and asking him what I should do. For the notebook, I steeled myself for the mourning process. I remember the month when I began the notebook, and from that time it had ever growing sentimental value for me. I melodramatically imagined myself years in the future missing the notebook and vaguely remembering with remorse the day that I lost it. 

But these ruminations, all turned out to be moot. 

————

There are lessons here.

My lessons in mindfulness tell me that when I first entered Conant, I was not being mindful. I allowed the stack of books to so totally capture my attention that my mind had no room for anything else. I find that this is the crucial balance one tries to achieve with mindfulness. On one side of thought, there is the absent-minded machinations of body which people typically term “going through the motions”. On the other side there is the unconscious and uncontrollable myopia which masquerades as focus, but is more debilitating than light attention. One must work to stay between these two poles if awareness is to be properly applied. 

And yet, there were times when awareness naively would have taken me down a path which led to me never reclaiming the books. As I walked back to Conant from my meeting with Ricardo, I told myself that I needed to stop searching for these items because I was clearly losing my mind to anxiety. I had done all I could, I said to myself, I searched all the reasonable places. And now I sent the email to Hayley.  The issue was now out of my hands, and now was not the time to drive myself crazy with obsessiveness, but was the time to wait. And yet, something still nagged at me. Something that I could not push out of my mind. It was the possibility that there was a place that I had not checked. My lessons in mindfulness teach equanimity and focus and the clearing of the mind away from distractions, and here was an apparent distraction which I could not relinquish. And it was only by succumbing to the pull of the distraction that I found what I lost. 

What is the meaning of this? Perhaps it is that the skills developed during meditation cannot be uncritically applied in the hopes of always achieving some positive outcome. In the same way we can use the concentration developed from mindfulness to push out false psychologically harmful thoughts, we can also use it to skim past ideas and inclinations which have a legitimate basis in reality. Thus, what we need is not a superficial application of the skills of mindfulness, but something deeper. Mindfulness, truly concerns not merely paying attention to something, but being ‘aware’. Not being aware of anything in particular, but rather existing in a ‘state of awareness’ where external information and your own actions are not lost to rumination or inattentiveness. 

Perhaps, then, my compulsions were heeded and pursued not in spite of my mindfulness training but because of it. I believed my responses to my anxieties had nothing to do with mindfulness because I felt I could not control these anxieties, but maybe the fact that I was able to use these feelings as a motive force for action, rather than being reduced to inaction by it, suggests that the feeling did not need to be absent. And of course my steadily increasing anxiety did have a basis in reality, because the loss of the items would have been heavy, and I knew that as time went on, the chance of finding them decreased. 

Also, although my searching proceeded within a subtle background of anxiety, the searches themselves revealed thinking which could only have resulted from ‘awareness’. In other words, my fear did not render me incapable of clear thinking, for after exhausting one possible location for the lost items I was repeatedly able to think of another, all the while constantly constructing narratives for how my items could have ended up in the new place. 

What am I trying to say here? That my meditation practices have been successful? I suppose they have. But I can also remember times when I demonstrated aspects of this “thinking in the context of anxiety” ever before I started mindfulness training. Still, from the training I am able to name and recognize these aspects for what they are, and hopefully I can become better at employing them.

I’ve had the experience of doing work which had meaning only to other people. You become a conscript to a cause you don’t believe in, living for the ideals and values of someone else. Now, I don’t believe man has ultimate and unlimited control of all the aspects of his life, but I do believe that the faith which allows him to contend with and manage his partial impotency can only exist if his life is lived according to a value system he identifies with.

“Confusion is a luxury which only the very, very young can possible afford…”
pg. 61 Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin








	‘Tell me,’ I said at last, ‘is there really no other way for you but this?’ To kneel down forever before an army of boys for just five dirty minutes in the dark?’

	‘Think,’ said Jacques, ‘of the men who have kneeled before you while you thought of something else and pretended that nothing was happening down there in the dark between your legs.’

	‘You think,’ he persisted, ‘that my life is shameful because my encounters are. And they are. But you should ask yourself why they are.’ 

	‘Why are they—shameful?’ I asked him.

	‘Because there is no affection in them, and no joy. It’s like putting an electric plug in a dead socket. Touch, but no contact. All touch, but no contact and no light.’ 

pg 82 


‘You are—how old? Twenty-six or seven? I am nearly twice that and, let me tell you, you are lucky. You are lucky that what is happening to you now is happening now and not when you are forty, or something like that, when there would be no hope for you and you would simply be destroyed.’ 

pg 80


Jacques followed my look. ‘He is very fond of you,’ he said, ‘already. But this doesn’t make you happy or proud, as it should. It makes you frightened and ashamed. Why?’

	‘I don’t understand him,’ I said at last. ‘I don’t know what his friendship means, I don’t know what he means by friendship.’

	Jacques laughed. ‘You don’t know what he means by friendship but you have the feeling it may not be safe. You are afraid it may change you. What kind of friendships have you had?’

	I said nothing. 

	‘Or for that matter,’ he continued, ‘what kind of love affairs?’
	
	I was silent for so long that he teased me, saying, ‘Come out, come out, wherever you are!’
	
	And I grinned, feeling chilled.

	‘Love him,’ said Jacques, with vehemence, ‘love him and let him love you. Do you think anything else under heaven really matters? And how long at best, can it last? since you are both men and still have everywhere to go? Only five minutes, I assure you, only five minutes, and most of that, helas! in the dark. And if you think of them as dirty, then they will be dirty—they will be dirty because you will be giving nothing, you will be despising your flesh and his. But you can make your time together anything but dirty, you can give each other something which will make both of you better—forever—if you will not be ashamed, if you will only not play it safe’ He paused, watching me, and then looked down to his cognac. ‘You play it safe long enough,’ he said, in a different tone, ‘and you’ll end up trapped in your own dirty body, forever and forever and forever—like me.’

- pg 84


This passage depicts the awakening of some feeling within the character. Or at least the reemergence of a feeling he always had but kept subdued through denial. What is ‘friendship’ in this context? I initially believed it was being used euphemistically, but perhaps I simply need to expand my definition of the word. Many of David’s previous friendships, as he described them, were ‘bluff, blunt, hearty and totally meaningless’ perhaps because he only gave to them the parts of himself he knew would be safely accepted. What Jacques is insisting on is a reality beyond these boundaries David had been operating within for so long, and this reality is arguably the only reality which could exist for David since his previous life consisted of living by a constant denial of what was real to him.

Jacques sets himself up as a foil for David urging him to acknowledge what he feels now regardless of how safe it feels lest he end up trapped in the safety he so urgently defended. Throughout the book there is a motif of missed opportunity often conveyed through Jacques reflection on the contrast between his own and the narrator’s life

Confusion is a luxury of the very, very young, and you are not so young anymore. 

Be glad what’s happening to you, is happening to you now and not when you’re forty, because if it happened then you would surely be destroyed. 

By the end of the above quoted passage, David seems to finally listen to Jacques advice.

Learning to Walk

Learning something new in physics is like exploring for yourself an unmapped city. You go from unknown house to obscure apartment gradually expanding the frontier of what is familiar and internalized while constantly seeking something never before seen. The mode of transportation is particularly important in such exploration because it would be impossible to reach the city hall at the city’s center if you did not have a way to first make a single forward step. 

This is where mathematics is relevant. Mathematics is often touted as the natural language of physics, and it is of course necessary in precisely defining and describing aspects of the physical world. But beyond its function as an analog to and extension of our written and verbal language, mathematics has the unique function of also serving as the way to move beyond the concepts encompassed by that language to other concepts or to ideas which have not been observed. If in our “city”, the school and the church represented distinct physical concepts or results (e.g., Newton’s Second Law and the Work Energy Theorem), then the way of moving between these locations would be mathematics. 

Thus, mathematics exists not only as the background language of the physical world but also a means of moving between logically consistent descriptions of that world. When we are learning the mathematics relevant to physics, we are consequently learning how to walk through physics. If we mistakenly enter some new terrain of physics, without knowing the basic mathematical framework which defines it, we are crippled and blind in our work, unable to move and unable to see clearly where we might move if we could. 

For those who intend to become physicists, perhaps it is constantly evident why mathematics is important.  But for everyone else who learns physics and questions the utility of mathematics, a simple dictum can be recalled: “By learning mathematics you are learning how to walk.”

Amir’s New Information
We live in these worlds which are fixed only in so far as we believe them to be. We realize this because every now and then aspects of the world which we could never see emerge from dark corners and announce their presence. Our world so fixed and reassuring is destabilized and inanely we don’t believe we could have been so naive as to believe we understood some, if any, even limited representation of the world. 

On Friday Amir told me he probably isn’t taking new students this year. He said probably, but it wasn’t clear if it was a “probably” intended to soften the blow of a definitive reality or meant something more true to the word. He said he was not completely opposed to taking new students but seeing as he currently had three students he felt he he was saturating the bound of the students he could take on. (Not his exact words) So it’s strange that I never saw this coming. I was just blithely plodding along like a donkey believing the path I was following would lead me somewhere if not better at least innocuous. Quietly devastated was what I felt after the meeting. I intended to work, but I found I could not do so. So I went to the Andover Theological Library and slept in one of the many westward facing chairs which were near the window. I had planned to go to the gym later in the day, but exhaustion wrangled me like water laden clothes from a rain storm. So I went home. EJ, Fidelis, and Kwadwo were preparing to leave for Kwami’s wedding and I was staying behind alone in the house. And in the house, I did no work. I just slept, and ate  and watched TV. Now, almost 48 hours later I have only begun to emerge from this episode.

But I can’t help but feel I’m unconsciously being dramatic here. In the past month, I’ve done some of the most fulfilling and insightful work in physics that I’ve accomplished in years. Some of that work extends from the project I worked on with Amir, but much of it does not. Does this new information change that reality? What has really changed? Perhaps only a name on my resume and the life path an association with that name would entail. Strangely, Amir gave me this information on the same day that I met with Reece (months after our initial meeting) to discuss my previous project ideas. Within the span of hours, as I was attempting to open one door, another door was preparing to close. But of course, as of now, neither door is in a concrete state. They can both close. Or they can both open, and although I may sometimes like to believe I have no agency in defining these states, I must admit a more thoughtful recounting of my history tells a different story.

The Emergence from the Fog
I am just now emerging from an episode of what seems to be called “mental fog”. It started while I was in school this afternoon and didn’t even partially lift until after I took a shower 30 minutes ago. Here were the characteristics I observed during this period of mental fog. 

Inability to Focus
Inability to Think; Impaired Cognition (e.g. I found it impossible to even outline the possible procedure of a grid search algorithm for my Kovacs analysis)
Elimination of Short Term Memory
Physical Fatigue (e.g. Getting up from bed and leaving the couch was difficult)
Feelings of Emptiness 
Lack of Motivation 

I’m thinking this might be due to the Nyquil I took late last night. This of course isn’t the first time this happened. I don’t know what causes it. I’ve been eating plenty of healthy foods (an orange in the morning, spinach the night before) and I got a good amount of sleep last night. And yet I still had this episode. I wonder if it is more physiological than nutritional. Is something wrong with my brain? Should I see a doctor about this?

The First Cup
Today I had my first cup of coffee in months, perhaps in the entire year. Earlier this morning I sat in Lamont library inexplicably exhausted and lethargic and I realized I’ve been feeling like this for weeks. Further I had a flash of insight that I wouldn’t be able to do the work I wanted to do this semester if I kept having these periodic and uncontrollable dips in energy. Feeling tired and defeated I decided I would go home early today and sleep and hope somehow I would have more energy tomorrow. But as I walked along the back campus path from Lamont towards Mass Ave, I decided to return Peskin and Schroeder to the Physics Library. It was an overnight copy and I didn’t want to have to worry about carrying it back to school tomorrow. To get to the physics library I walked through the Science Center and within the Science Center I passed a coffee stand. I passed it, but then I stopped to look back, contemplating whether I wanted to step off this edge. I could either return the book and go home or I could get a cup of coffee and see if I can continue to work. I partly already made the decision through my hesitation; I needed to work, so I got the cup of coffee. 

It worked almost instantly which suggests perhaps I didn’t need it. But with my energy returned I was again able to work. So begins my renewed addiction to this substance that I eliminated from my life in the Spring of 2012.

Differential Geometry
Yesterday, I attended a first class in differential geometry. The class was interesting and it was nice hearing formal definitions for things one understands intuitively, but what was really surprising was the problem set handed out at the end of class. The instructor prefaced handing out the assignment by saying that he hadn’t yet taught us the material relevant for it, but strangely I still expected to be able to complete  at least one of the problems. I couldn’t do a single one. I had the vague belief that for an introductory assignment it should be possible to use my own current knowledge to work out some preliminary answers, but this wasn’t the case. The assignment used definitions and terminology that I had not seen before. The lesson here is that if I am going to learn differential geometry for some future project I will have a large amount of work to do towards it. 

By the way, for a future project on functional integrals and stokes theorem, some of the subjects I’ll probably need to learn are
Differential Geometry
Topology
Functional Analysis 

Store of Problems 
This is only tangentially related to the differential geometry experience: There is a great utility in having a large store of solved problems for a subject that you intend to research. I previously spurned course assignments and their unmotivated problem contexts, but having a collection of clear examples of how to apply the theoretical techniques of a subject precisely and correctly gives you a reference for when you’re working on related problems in less understood contexts. This is also why it’s useful to type these problems into a pdf document. This way they are easily searchable for key terms and all your notes can be stored on your computer for easy reference. Of course, my new perspective on working through textbooks leads me to qualify this by saying there should be a larger personal purpose/goal for working through a textbook.



Misleading Superficial Superlative 5:00pm
I think whenever someone is trying to explain success or some optimal achievement, there is a tendency to overemphasize a superficial superlative as the direct cause of the accomplishment. It’s like the human mind, when confronted by shear noise can’t help but select out the fluctuation with the highest amplitude as the one true signal. 

In the first lecture for AM203: Disordered Systems and Stochastic Processes, Amir talked about the Hardy-Weinberg law and its history. Apparently, Hardy formulated the law as a note (and not even a full paper) to a journal of biology. The mathematics of the law is simple and easy to understand but the implications are profound. After he introduced the topic, Amir mentioned that the law showed that there is no strong correlation between the complexity of a theory and its depth. When he said this, my mind flashed to special relativity. 

Special relativity given its physical depth is ludicrously simple to formulate. A high school student without a knowledge of calculus and knowing which questions to ask could theoretically construct it herself. Of course, general relativity is also physically deep, and is much more difficult to formulate mathematically (so too is quantum mechanics), but it still deserves mention that not all physically deep results in physics require difficult mathematics. 

And you wouldn’t expect this to be so according to the “misleading superficial superlative.” We all “know” that physics (and perhaps science in general) is potentially mathematically abstruse and difficult to understand, so we would naturally expect that the results in physics which have the most depth, that is the results with the farthest reaching implications would also be the most difficult to formulate mathematically, but this is not always or even primarily the case. (I think one can do a study/inventory of the difficulty of the mathematical formulation vs. the physical depth of the result to see how the two relate to one another. Should string theory be included? Many of its results are indeed physically deep, but we don’t really know if they are true representations of the world.)

Similarly, given how intellectually “difficult” physics is, we would also expect that really only the most intelligent physicists would make the most deep contributions to the subject. But assuming our measure of intelligence through IQ is valid (and there are many reasons to assume it’s not), it’s clear that there is no clear correlation between an individual’s IQ and the quality of science he or she produces. (Why is it clear?) Einstein and Feynman are notorious for having relatively high IQs but not sufficiently high as to justify their correspondingly outsized contributions to physics. 

For the physical depth of a theory and the quality of work a scientist produces, mathematical complexity and intelligence, respectively, are misleading superficial superlatives. Other examples abound: the strongest football players are also not the best defenders, or quarter backs; the students with the highest IQs don’t get the best grades, and the students with the best grades don’t have the most fulfilling careers. In a plethora of cases, when we attempt to transfer the judgment of one metric an individual is eminent in to another situation we find the results incompatible. 

I think the application of the superficial superlative comes from a positive place in humans. It comes from the desire to understand achievements which seem anything but random. But this desire lazily directed causes people to conflate eminent performance in some holistically defined arena to eminence according to a one dimensional metric. It stems from the human desire to reduce a definitive result which is objectively the result of many competing causes to something which is primarily (and falsely) the result of one.


It’s not true that the most attractive women will be the hardest to date (patriarchal)
It’s not true that the most attractive men will be able to date the most women (patriarchal)
The strongest football players are not the best defenders or quarter backs
The students with the highest IQs don’t get the best grades. 
The students with the best grades don’t have the most fulfilling and/or successful careers
The student who answers the most questions correctly in class doesn’t always have the best understanding of the subject


The Will To Take It 10:40 pm
It seems that the people who do good work in science and in life are not always the ones who are the most intelligent or most transparently perceptive or capable. Instead, it seems that the people who managed to achieve things we now see as great, primarily had a huge desire to achieve them (Am I falling into the misleading superficial superlative here?). It’s not that they weren’t intelligent, or that they weren’t disciplined. Surely they were all these things, but they also had a clear will to pursue and present the ideas that interested them to the world. They chose to actively create the world they wanted to live in, to create the things they wanted to see in the world. It wasn’t really specific eminent ability which set them apart; I think it was more a clear sense of what they wanted and a ever present will compelling them to take it.

Lessons of Work In Physics
From the past month of doing some physics work on my own, I’m beginning to correct some misconceptions I had about what I needed to do to produce interesting work. Here are a few of the corrections

When reading a physics paper, you don’t need to understand everything in the paper for parts of the paper to be useful to you. 

Your work does not need to be as mathematically abstract or difficult to understand as the most abstract papers in a field in order for it to be valuable

If you find a technique or idea in a paper or a textbook interesting, then it’s a good sign that it can be useful to you. 

Also, this point deserves it’s own paragraph: Reading papers. I think the greatest impediment to you publishing your own work is your unwillingness/inability to engage with the current literature. Part of the cause is that you were largely uninspired by the papers you read, but the other part is that you were possibly also trying to engage with them as textbooks (that is, trying to completely understand everything about them before you move on). Hopefully, with the above lessons you’ll be able to engage with physics papers more effectively. 

Following Subtle Intuition to Insight

Self Determination 1:39 AM
I am thinking back to my work with Jesse Thaler and today, perhaps for the first time, I have realized my error. I was relying entirely too much on Jesse to set the agenda for my work. Of course he’s the experienced Professor and he arguably should have been directing the work, but with years gone and with the remnants of my work languishing in rarely opened tex files I could not help feel a sense of resentment that I had not been able to publish anything from all that I did. I worked through three projects (Multiple R-Symmetry Breaking, Hidden Local Symmetry, Multiple SUSY Breaking and DM) dedicating two years of my life to this work and none of it resulted in any papers. Not that publishing papers is the end-all-be-all for physics, but I would like to see my work in the literature once. And my undergraduate thesis does not count in this regard because I think its crappy work. I would like to see work that I value and that I’m proud of published, and for the longest time I partly blamed Jesse for seemingly denying me of that. But really how could I expect him to provide something he had no ability to provide? Does he know my value system? Does he know whether I think a project is worthwhile because it’s intrinsically interesting or because I am a peon at the bottom of hierarchical structure and must therefore do what I’m told? 

And here I am again, apparently, fulfilling the expectations of a student researcher. Working on a project I did not exactly choose under a direction I cannot completely understand. And of course I think the result may be different, and it of course may indeed be. But it would be to the luck of the draw and not really through any conscious action on my part. 

I hate this tendency to fall back on old skills when confronted with a world which is intractable according to a newly learned approach, but perhaps there is something to it. What defined my physics work in the past was that it was primarily self determined. I went to New Orleans to try to reclaim that spirit and almost killed myself in the process. But I  think if I try to reclaim this spirit, while not trying to hide it, but instead trying to present it to the world the psychological outcome will be different. 

Who was it that made the banal pronouncement that the best way to solve a problem is to keep trying different approaches? (It was Feynman) Yes. I think it is time for another approach.

There is Always an Answer

People say what distinguishes homework and math contest problems from research problems is that for the former you always know there’s a solution. I disagree. I think if we define these problems more generally as questions, then the argument is that there are always answers to homework and math research problems but there are not always answers to research problems. This can’t be true

There is always an answer. It may not be the answer you expect because the question was formulated out of ignorance of the fundamental properties of the related subjects, but an answer in its general form always exists. Instead, what distinguishes research problems from the problems one encounters in more artificial contexts is the time scale for solution. You can expect to answer math contest problems and homework on the order of weeks at the most, typically because they are stated as to be simply solvable and the methods you use to solve them are evident from the question format. Instead for research problems, a large part of the problem is finding a more appropriate question/problem to ask and to do so requires exploring a sometimes large space of possible questions multiplied by the space of possible ways to answer each of those questions. 

For both types of problems, the existence of an answer at least in the form of added knowledge of a more intelligent way to engage with the question is established. The question is only concerned with how long it will take to find it. 

Another distinguishing factor is the completeness of the answer.  
* I need to mention why this is true. It comes from two sources: the consistency of the world we live in and the correctness of our physical theories in describing certain aspects of the world. Because these theories cannot describe everything, but are still valid in certain regimes and can still describe a consistent world we can proceed with the faith that there are theories which extend beyond our current ones and describe aspects of the world which are inaccessible to us.

Climbing the Mountain
I (and many other people before me) liken research to exploring a large unknown territory. The most crucial discoveries are extended and well connected patterns in the terrain. Let’s call them mountains. Many people spend large portions of their lives climbing never before seen mountains looking down at valleys and telling the rest of the world what they see. Really a large part of our education is climbing the mountains which were first discovered by other people, and thereby hopefully learning the techniques which will help us climb such structures on our own. 

Often there are research trends where large communities of people work and work to understand the terrain of a single mountain. They look from various perches on the mountain at the valley below, trying their best to describe what they see of the world. But sometimes there is someone who for ignorance of the proper path or simply disdain for it decides to look for something else. She takes a different path, by all current understanding, the wrong path. She walks this path, and walks and walks until she finds some elevation. Over time she recognizes the elevation was really a hill and even later she sees that all this time she was really climbing a mountain, some new mountain that she never heard of before. 

She continues to climb this mountain and when she gets to the top she looks across the landscape to the mountains that her compatriots climbed and she sees how seemingly far away it is, but recognizes it’s true proximity. Just months before had she taken the right path, she would now be somewhere on that mountain rather than where she is. 

And where is she? She looks down at the valley which her mountain shares with the other. She knows this valley because the news of it was shouted and announced throughout her own education, long before she learned how to climb mountains of her own, long before she climbed the mountain where she stands. And yet, looking down at this valley from her perch, she sees things she never heard about before. The news never mentioned the dense jungle she sees, or the river she flows through it, and she also sees why. From a vantage point on the other mountain, the entire valley cannot be seen. A part of the valley is obscured by a ridge which looks like a natural and unimportant part of the terrain, but which really hides a bank and a forest and a river. How far does the jungle extend? What of the world does it contain that we have never before seen? To where does the river lead? She does not know the answers to these questions, but she does know that in her own lifetime it will be impossible to explore this new terrain on her own. No, she will need some help. She will need some of those people on the other mountain and maybe some others who have yet to learn how to climb themselves. And she will need to show them how so long ago, taking a wrong turn led her to this place. 

*I just realized Climbing the Mountain is the name of Jagdish Mehra’s biography of Julian Schwinger


Creating New Accounting File
I want a new accounting file in order to keep track of how much money I’m spending and saving. This is to ensure I remain on track with my financial goals for the year. 

I did not remain on track with my financial goals this year because there were some unanticipated expenses (The homeowner bill I paid for the house during the month of January, rental payments for moving to a new location, road trip, new laptop) and also I stopped being conscientious about how much money I was spending. This was partly because keeping up with my accounting file came to be too much work. Finally, parts of my budget were unrealistic. The budget fit an ideal of how I wanted to spend money and not how I actually spent it. For example, I didn’t include costs of travel or buying new books. 

So I need a new system which is simpler
don’t keep track of each expense every day. (Maybe just total weekly expenditures)
have a monthly savings goal. 
have a discretionary fund to pay for books, clothes, shoes, flight tickets, extracurriculars 
(Keep Track of These Expenses?)
Still send money to dad, but talk to Joke to discuss how much she can send as well
know where you’re going to get more money (odd jobs? librarian position? etc.)

Desired Expenditures
New Glasses -$200
Clothes -$100

Google Page Rank as a Random Walk 09/10/2015
In AM203 (Introduction to Disordered Systems and Stochastic Processes) today Amir explained Google Page Rank in a really simple way. He said the kernel of the idea is that web pages are ranked not only by how many other webpages link to them, but the rank of these webpages as well according to the same metric. For example, a web page with receives many links from sites which themselves receive many links would be linked higher than a webpage with which receives many links from sites which don’t receive any links. The way one encompasses these ideas in a “random walk” is to imagine each web page as a node on a network. Now, assume there is a certain probability for us to move from one node to another (i.e. there is a certain probability to link from one website to another). There is also a probability to stay at the same node. Then given an initial probability to be at each node, we can compute the long time probabilities to be at any node. It is possible to prove that for certain types of networks (ones where the defining transition matrix is not symmetric and which has all diagonal elements filled I think) you can always get a stationary distribution.


Some questions: 
How is the probability to go from one web page to another related to the actual process of moving from one web page to another? 

How is the final (i.e. stationary) distribution of webpages related to the ranking of the pages? My guess is that the nodes with the highest probabilities are ranked the highest, and those with the lowest probabilities are ranked the lowest.

How does this network picture and the associated probabilities relate into the actual process of searching for a webpage?

Tired
I’m tired. I’m so tired. It comes everyday now. A loosening of concentration. An inability to hold and maintain the various strands of a thought. I am becoming less than myself. It is like those two months after June 24 last year, except there has been no prior breakdown. I feel like I am experiencing dementia. I’ve felt like this for so long, but it also affects my memory blurring the outlines of emotional events so I am not exactly sure when all of this started. I need help?

Peripheral Vision 
At night, our central vision which makes use of the cone cells in our eyes is much weaker than our peripheral vision which primarily uses rod cells. The cone cells respond to shades of color, thus making them less useful in low light where colors are difficult to distinguish. Thus peripheral vision is much better for distinguishing objects and movement at night. We could say that in order to see something the most clearly at night we must focus on it but look away from it.  

Whenever I’ve looked directly at physics and my work in it, I always seemed to enter this evacuated space of values. In this space physics was the most important thing in my life and it seemed that if I failed to achieve what was my present goal, my life was meaningless. What was worse was I could not see that this perspective was really an interpretation of life. It was not life as it had to be lived but life as I chose to live it. When my work went well, while I had this perspective I felt strong almost as though my life had a resonant meaning that I was only now coming to terms with. But when my work did not go well, when it faltered or I reached an impasse for longer than I deemed acceptable I could not envision anything less than death as the only recourse. My life had shrunk to this small moment, this infinitesimal event in a spectrum of events, and I could not see beyond it. 

I emerge from these episodes in myopia with a temporary clarity, but I nevertheless remain susceptible to a future loss of perspective. And when I fall back into it, the spiral always manifests in my actions. A decision to work more on my project instead of reading a book or writing; A decision to return to a former calculation instead of going to sleep; A decision to complete a set of notes instead of studying for a tangential class. Soon enough my value system is again warped and I stand on the precipice of a cliff dancing and singing ignorant of the fall I may suffer. 

It happened last night, which means it was really happening for at least a week prior. I was operating within an evacuated space of values and within this space the message was clear: you are worthless because you cannot achieve your goals. Two assertions, existing as interpretation, masquerading as hard truths that my mind could not disprove. It was true, it said, You are a failure. You could say these are just thoughts in your head, yes, but they are legitimate nonetheless. And so there I was again, unable to see anything beyond these goals which remain beyond my grasp. Unable to see my sister and my mother and my father; unable to see the people I’ve connected with; unable to see the books I’ve read or the stories I’ve written. As blind as a man staring at a painting in the darkness. 

But as I slept, my mind worked to expand my consciousness. Thoughts of my family and others seeped in, and when I awoke I saw the lies I had been telling myself all this time, the lies I was living as though they were truths. I had spent so long looking directly at my goals, seeing them and only them in the spectrum of motivations which could give life meaning, that I could see nothing else. I was in that place I was last year before I came to Harvard. A place where life has no meaning because I had finally succeeded in throwing away all the other meanings besides the one I believed was important. I wish, future reader, I could leave you with some lesson that you can take away and apply to your life so this does not happen to you, but it is a strange fact that existing in a mode of thought and recognizing it’s wrongness does not also afford one with the ability to escape it. It was not my choice to leave this space of thought, and so I cannot tell you how to do so if it befalls you as well. 

What I can suggest is that you construct your life so that it doesn’t happen. These goals you so desperately want to achieve cannot be achieved with the tension and feverish intensity you believe they require. Such focus would suffocate you, leaving no space and no air for the other values which contextualize and support the one you currently champion. You would exist like an eye at night, struggling to see something by looking at it directly. Instead, I suggest you look away from this thing you supposedly value, see it with soft eyes which are not driven by fear. It is only then that you will truly be able to see it. 

Gravity and the Quantum
What is important is the question. Sakharov’s idea was just one way to encapsulate your own ideas in a mathematical framework. There is no reason to be attached to his formalism. Focus on the central idea, explore various mathematical frameworks of quantum field theory and gravity and see if any of them could encompass what you’re driving at. It is a truism of physics that all new theories are initially abstruse and mathematically complex because they are inevitably interpreted and written within the language of previous theories. It is not always possible to escape this quality of physics, and you should not limit yourself by believing you have to.

Learning String Theory
So I think I have to learn this subject that I’ve avoided for so long. I mean it still feels somewhat antithetical to the spirit of what I want to do in physics, but in order to properly criticize it I need to know something about it. I think in order to not be overwhelmed by the amount of material in this subject, I need to clarify some goals that I want to achieve from this study. Primarily, I want to be able to understand how gravitation is manifest in String Theory and how the AdS/CFT correspondence is formulated. The former so I could get a sense of if the formalism is correct and the latter because Reece mentioned that one could interpret it as a sort of induced gravity framework.

Narcissism and Insecurity
	Last Thursday afternoon I emailed Victor, requesting that he be a recommender for my fall fellowship applications. When I finished the data science project, I told him about the fellowships I was applying to and he generously agreed to serve as a recommender for me, so this email was to act as a confirmation of his previous agreement. In the past he had usually responded to emails quickly, so I expected to hear something back within a day. But when the weekend came and I hadn’t received a response, my mind began the preparation for panic. I tried to rationalize the silence. Maybe they found a flagrant mistake in my data analysis? And maybe the mistake was so large that Victor was embarrassed to speak to me? Or perhaps, since Victor was the one who hired me and paid me almost $3000 for my work, my work was so shoddy and the compensation so out of proportion with what was deserved that Victor was fired. He was fired and maybe he wasn’t replying my emails because he was alternately angry for my failures and embarrassed he was fired.
	It’s strange how writing out these previous thoughts paints them as patent signs of a distorted reality. The last one (Victor being fired because of me) was unquestionably entertained, but it was certainly taken less seriously than the rest. More assuredly, almost to the point of complete belief, I thought that Victor wasn’t contacting me because ultimately Reasoning Mind was unhappy with the work I completed. I was so absolutely convinced of this that I began composing an email to someone else in Reasoning Mind, trying to find someway to contact Victor. Mentally, my plan was to ask him what I had done wrong in the project, so I could do better next time (This is is still probably good to do). 
	Alas, Sunday afternoon Victor emailed me back. In the email he asked how my classes and work were going, stated that of course he would write a recommendation, and informed me of a positive report about the Reasoning Mind platform by SRI international. 
	A symptom of narcissism is an inability to interpret external events as caused by factors completely unrelated to oneself. And when one mixes insecurity into that already debilitating psychological bag, the result is a perspective on the world which is simultaneously self-referencing and self-negating. I don’t know how often I engage in such inaccurate interpretations of reality because rarely do I have the opportunity to juxtapose them with reality itself. But this episode, if I am able to keep it in my memory, should serve as a hard example of my recurrent inability to see the world as cleanly as it presents itself. (30 mins to write)

The Classic Narcissist
A symptom of narcissism is an inability to interpret external events as caused by factors completely unrelated to oneself. The classic narcissist sees every person and every action within a sufficient physical radius as mirrors to his self, and thus only sees them in so far as their propensity to react to his own existence. His vision is biased and incessantly self-referential, making walking through a crowd an almost insurmountable burden because of all of the people “watching him”.  He looks at the world and like most people he does not see it, he only views those aspects which confirm his own vanities.

Learning String Theory II
Two days into learning string theory, I became completely overwhelmed. Not only was there so much to learn, the implicit questions the subject sought to answer were distinct from questions I internalized in my study of quantum field theory. I could intuit no direction for the subject, and consequently I could not see why I should be studying it. Having lost all motivation to cross this wall that I felt I needed to cross, I felt defeated. 

Coincidentally, this experience came at the same time that I was re-reading sections of Kuhn’s Structure. In a later chapter (Chapter 12) Kuhn mentions that scientists with opposing paradigms differ in three main arenas,

	1.) their ideas of the problems and questions an acceptable paradigm should answer (e.g. Newton’s theory was initially rejected because unlike Aristotle and Descartes’s theories, it did not explain what caused the attractive forces between particles of matter. It only postulated them.)
	2.) the meaning of terms used to describe the world (e.g. Copernicus was called mad because he claimed that the earth moved. The men who called him this were not specifically wrong, because what they meant by earth was primarily the fixed coordinate system that we all exist in)
	3.) the effective “world” that they each live in. (This is the most vague of Kuhn’s differences and in a way is really a combination of the first two. The two scientists essentially can’t communicate fully with one another because their fundamental premises of what science is and what questions it should answer exist at cross-purposes.)

Thus a scientist in an older paradigm interpreting the structure of a new paradigm of science would always find it to be somewhat off because it would be operating within a space which doesn’t make clean reference to all the things he feels are important in a theory. 

Kuhn’s discussion is more of a sociological observation of how science progresses, and I realized it called into question all of my previous reservations against string theory. The seemingly gratuitous expansion to extra dimensions and particles existing in super-multiplets. It is all strange from the perspective a quantum field theory whose goal is to describe how particles interact, but if you accept the premise that the particle world view is limited and hence incomplete, you could then entertain the idea of a paradigm where the concepts of string theory do not seem so strange.

In the past, whenever I started learning a new field of physics, I was almost always initially stymied by my desire to interpret the results of the new field in terms of the questions answered by a different previously learned field. When I learned Quantum Mechanics, I felt somewhat unfulfilled by the fact that I couldn’t explicitly compute the path of a quantum mechanical particle. When I learned quantum field theory, I was constantly searching for what the energy levels of the field theory were and what wave equation one could solve to obtain them. And now with string theory, I am rejecting the foundational work of the subject because it doesn’t feel like it is really relevant to field theory. I know this perception is false, but even if it were true it is beside the point. 

The reason some fields in physics are so different is because they answer different questions. A single framework is incapable of providing all the information we can obtain from the world, so we need many different ones. String theory might seem strange and even wrong from the perspective and standards of a particle based field theory, but this is because string theory is operating within a different knowledge space of problems and answers. Therefore any evaluation of string theory based on the standards of particle physics based field theory is inherently flawed.

Acne and Suicide
Two weeks ago, some of my acne came back. It came in the form of a string of three pimples (nodules) running diagonally along the middle right side of my chin. It scared me. I thought my medication had stopped working. I didn’t want to go outside. It was hard to make and maintain eye contact with people. I couldn’t think clearly. The effects remain until today. Which leads me to something larger. 

I think I need to take medication for the way I feel. My mind has been cloudy all of this week. So much so that I wasn’t able to do any really productive work besides read a paper. Suicidal ideation is par for the course with me, but I don’t know, I feel closer to it somehow. Fortunately, since I cannot think clearly I also lack the ability to completely plan my suicide. I still hate most people. It’s the way they look at me, the way they react to me. The anger induced from this hatred acts as a mental cloud as well. I really can’t do this anymore.

The False Image
You want to be special. You want to be important. So you say I’m going to do something big and grandiose. I will publish ten papers in five years. That will make me important. Or you look at those who came before you. Those who are now famous and well established. You say you will emulate their lives, their work, their decisions and by so doing you will become as great as they are. 

But there is a mistake in this decision. A mistake of value systems. A mistake of motivations. A mistake in the vision of what a life means and thus how it should be lived. 

So often we look at the external of a thing and mistake what we see for the entire reality. We believe that if we can make contact with the external then we will capture somehow the essence. And because we cannot see beyond what a thing appears to be, we fail to see it for what it is.

When I go into classrooms, do you know what the number one emotion I feel in overwhelming waves is? Fear. I’m talking about I teach at NYU and I teach at…MIT and these are the brightest and the best and the most privileged students and they’re fucking terrified. Terrified because of they’re student loans. Terrified because they don’t know if they’re going to get a fucking job. Terrified because of the way economic situation is imposing a cash nexus on people, there’s only value if you do something with money. Terrified because of pressure coming from their peers, the sense of rabid competition.  And so for me, even having my young people, not being completely consumed by this fear that’s being imposed by a society that is encouraging these people to be afraid, that the world is going to be worse. So I’m like, any improvement would be utopian if my students did not feel fear.  

And I don’t mean just your average fear. We’re supposed to feel it. But that constant fear “You’re not going to have a good future unless you do XY and Z”. 

Panel with Peter Thiel, Aubrey de Grey, Eliezer Yudkowsky
There is something to be said to for trying to avoid doing things that too many other people are doing…. There is something…very deep about human nature which is social and imitative…and there are ways in which that’s good,…but in terms of this question of where one can really push the envelope and make a difference it’s important to explore areas that people are not doing. - Thiel 

It’s always appalled me that really really bright scientists almost all work in the most competitive fields. The ones in which they’re making the least difference. In other words, the ones in which if they were hit by a truck then the same discovery would be made by somebody else about ten minutes later. I’ve absolutely never understood that. The only sort of proto-explanation I’ve thought of is that it’s a function of the way we’re educated, especially the way boys tend to be educated which places too much emphasis on competition, and on getting people to be wistful for competition if they’re not competing with the people they perceive to be the other bright people. 

 - de Grey 


The less attention something is getting the easier it is for marginal effort to make a difference. And what you actually have, if I may be permitted a bit of Hensonian cynicism, is status affiliation where you congregate where the people who have the most status already are. And by giving to that organization you affiliate yourself with them and so the large ones have the highest status already so you give more to them  and you affiliate with a larger group of higher status people and the actual object of the philanthropy the people you’re supposed to be helping, the goal you’re trying to accomplish [is never actually fulfilled]. 

- Yudkowsky

There is something about the…problem of the way status is measured in our society. There is something about competition that is…it’s good up to a certain point and then it goes very, very badly wrong. 

[…]

There are too many smart people in my opinion who are in physics in our society, and…that I think is sort of a symptom of the fact that people can excel at a very early age in something like music, or chess, or math or physics, and the competitive thing then ends up tracking people towards those fields rather than to fields where maybe it takes a little bit longer to build up the skill set but ultimately a much bigger contribution can be made. 

If we could get all the superstring theorists to work on either Anti-Aging or AI. They get to choose one or the other, I think we’ll make incredible progress.

Brainstorming

My goal is to develop some problem or question I can answer. The question will likely involve the AdS/CFT because that’s what I’m learning at the moment. 

And I’m trying to think of the most efficient way to simultaneously learn about the AdS/CFT and develop a question I want to answer about it. Getting a set of lecture notes and systematically working through each statement is one way to do it, but it’ll only achieve the former goal. It’s also really boring. Finally, it would be largely consistent with my tendency to avoid engaging with the literature, and I’m trying to get out of that habit.

So instead, I’m going to take a cue from myself, and try to learn and work through solving and discussing problems. I’ve done this before, and although I managed to learn about some field, my work often ended up insular and disconnected. So, I will try to ground my problems in the research literature. 

So each week I will write up a short document/set of notes which hopefully moves me closer to the larger goal. The document would be on a new topic I’m trying to learn and would involve me discussing/solving a problem. 

The possible write up types I originally thought of were
Answering a question from a textbook or set of lecture notes
Abstractly creating a question for myself disconnected from a specific context
Developing a question (no matter how small) from a research paper

Given my larger goal of eventually determining a question I can pursue for myself, I think the last write up type is the optimal route. It will allow me to practice learning whatever new topic I’m concerned with and will allow me to practice formulating questions. 

I know that as I work to develop these problem write-ups, I will have to learn some subjects and do work tangential to them. I will probably have to work through many different exercises. I don’t think I need to write up all of these exercises, but it would be nice to have a way to consolidate them so they’re not lost to me. Lugging around a single notebook for each new project is inefficient and inflexible. Recopying work at the end of the day to a notebook I keep at home is also inefficient. Keeping all my work in my scratch pad hasn’t really worked in the past. Back in New Orleans, I have tons of work in notebooks which I don’t remember doing and which I cannot organize. It makes it impossible to find any one thing I’ve done in the past. 

A better approach I think would be to do the work on white sheets of paper which I will eventually collect and bound together.

Tylenol as Anti-depressant

Here’s how I would describe a depressive episode: when it got to be really bad, it was like I was in a state of semi-consciousness. It was kind of like those waking dreams I used to have. In those dreams I would open my eyes to find my entire body seemingly paralyzed. I would attempt to move my arm but something internal was depressing whatever mechanism was responsible for such motion. And the more I resisted, the more intense the feeling of rigidity and paralysis. 

In a depressive episode I usually experience something similar, but the paralysis is cognitive rather than physical. I become unable to hold together the strands of thought which typically define coherent logic. The last time it happened was Monday night, and it had been occurring for at least a week prior. Strangely, outside of these vague outlines, I can’t remember the exact conditions of my mind when it was in that state. It seems that the state is something which needs to be actively experienced in order to be accurately described, but paradoxically while you are experiencing it your mind lacks the wherewithal to accurately describe anything. 

What I think helped me emerge from the episode was Tylenol. On Monday night, after spending the evening and early night listening to the Halo podcast series Hunt The Truth I had the strange idea that Tylenol could act as a anti-depressant. In retrospect, it perhaps wasn’t so strange. I was listening to the podcast series in a sort of fugue depressive state. I hadn’t been able to work the entire weekend and I had just reached the end of the first day of the week without making up for the weekend’s lapse. I was feeling the not so quiet panic which periodically grips me and makes me question my life status. What’s more I couldn’t feel anything, except an incredible urge to kill myself. I had spent part of the night researching ways to purchase a helium gas tank for a peaceful suicide, and as I listened to the podcast on my cell phone (because for some reason dealing with my laptop was just too much for me to handle) I lazily searched for “signs of severe depression” and “did you ever get over your depression.” So the questions of depression and possible pseudo-solutions were all in my mind, when I finally searched for its relationship to Tylenol. 

After reading that it could indeed be used as an anti-depressant, I walked to CVS (it was 10:30pm at night) and I bought a bottle of Tylenol. I chose regular strength in order to forestall any addiction or sensitization effects for as long as possible. Since Monday night I’ve taken about 12 pills (roughly two pills every five hours I’m conscious) and I’ve noticed that I am indeed feeling better. No, that’s inaccurate. My mind has cleared up a bit, so I am therefore able to do some work, and because I am able to work I feel better. Just today I made good progress on both my gravity/ads/cft work, my Kovacs work, and a personal physics problem. It feels good to be able to think again, and I’m glad for this temporary respite from suicidal ideation. But I am partly scared, for how long can this last before the effects of the medication wear off?

(A Talk About Competition)

In the absence of any larger goal to motivate them, people compete with one another as a means of validating their lives. 


A committee of reviewers is just a new set of masters. I’m not saying you shouldn’t work towards submitting a paper I’m saying you should constantly evaluate your goals to ensure you’re working in a good direction.

Mouse in a Maze

“Some years ago, psychologists used a similar maze puzzle in an intriguing experiment with college students. A cartoon mouse was shown trapped inside a picture of a maze, and the task was to help the mouse find the way out. There were two different versions of the task. One was positive, approach-oriented; the other was negative or avoidance-oriented. In the positive condition, there was a piece of Swiss cheese lying outside the maze, in front of a mouse hole. in the negative condition, the maze was exactly the same, but instead of the Swiss cheese feast at the finish, an owl hovered above the maze, ready to swoop down and capture the mouse in its talons at any moment. 

	The maze takes less than two minutes to complete, and all the students who took part in the experiment solved their maze. But the contrast in the aftereffects of working on different versions of the maze was striking. When participants later took a test of creativity, those who had helped their mouse avoid the owl turned in scores that were fifty percent lower than the scores of students who had helped their mouse find the cheese. The state of mind elicited by attending to the owl had resulted in a lingering sense of caution, avoidance, and vigilance for things going wrong. This mind-state in turn weakened creativity, closed down options, and reduced the students’ flexibility in responding to the next task. 

	This experiment tells us something very important: the same action (even something as slight as solving a simple maze puzzle) has different consequences depending on whether it is done to move toward something we welcome…or to avoid something negative.

Into the Eyes of Prejudice
Each time I sense an overt and subtly hostile distance communicated by strangers, a distance which appears to have a racial motivation, I now try to remind myself that if these people are truly as prejudiced as their actions suggest, it is perhaps not their fault. 

I tell myself most likely because of the lottery of birth, the exigencies of environment, and the probabilities associated with personal inclination these people lacked the opportunity and the requisite desire to interact with others who did not grow up under the same racial or social umbrella as themselves. And since people are inevitably meaning-constructing beings, in the absence of any personally lived experience to the contrary, these parochial souls had no choice but to accept the narratives presented by the media and history as true. And so through no fault of their own, but primarily through the failed collective of the culture in which they grew up, they see me no more than as a caricature of who I am and often have no choice but to engage with me as such. 

And I remind myself of the social, and not personal origins, of prejudice not for their sake, but for my own. Because when I see that someone is attempting to engage with me on a false plane, that is based on a false image of who I am, reflexively my mind attempts to erase their own legitimate existence from my purview. The conceptual representation of who they are becomes fuzzier in my mind and I see less of what makes them an individual. Immediately they are thrust into that nether realm of identity that we place all which is not immediately relevant to ourselves: “The Other”. This is essentially a process of dehumanization, and so I resist it because I know that through this knee-jerk process of dehumanizing another person, I am indirectly dehumanizing myself. 

One of the most unanticipated and often ignored aspects of race relations in America is the intrinsic mirror process of prejudice. Namely, once you deny the identity of one group of people, you must also deny the parts of yourself which bear any resemblance to that group. And since obviously all people are humans in this world, in order to make the prejudice consistent and in place with your personal identity you must go along cutting off whole swaths of your intrinsic human identity in order to maintain your sense of superiority over this other group. 

This is partly what James Baldwin talked about when he discussed “the price of the ticket” European Immigrants paid to come to America in the early 20th century. Then, America was deeply in the throes of a black-white racial caste system and those coming to the country had to operate within it. This meant that all of the immigrants coming from Germany, Poland, or Ireland in the new century eventually had to relinquish their original cultural identities and ultimately only view themselves as the “white” people on a binary racial divide. It didn’t happen over night. It has taken decades for Italians and Irish people to view themselves with an implicit racial solidarity. But through this viewpoint, the process of taking people of differing tribes and cultural groups from West Africa, erasing their individual identities, and homogenizing them as “Negro slaves” came full circle to affect the masters and their 20th century counterparts as well. 

Cognizant of the double edged nature of dehumanization, I try my best not to engage in it. And it is for this reason that, after the initial hardening of my gaze when I encounter prejudice, I soften my eyes and attempt to not confuse the person with the lens through which they see they world, a lens they most likely had no agency in choosing.

Meeting Gavin Aung Thang
I met the creator of ZenPencils today. He had a book signing in the Harvard Coop. I almost didn’t go because I didn’t receive a reminder from Google Calendar, but fortunately I remembered that the event was on either the 12th or the 13th of this month. Before the signing, Gavin talked about his process for creating one of the webcomics (The comic on lifetime learning featuring the lady painting was his example). He also recounted the story of how he left an unsatisfying job and began drawing webcomics full time, a journey he often referenced through his comics and their discussion. I went to the book signing just planning to hear Gavin speak, but I ended up buying both of his comic collections. I had them both signed with my sister’s name, but I think I’ll just give her one of them.  

There was something psychologically refreshing about this experience. Maybe it was just meeting in person someone I had known only remotely. Many of the other fans asked great questions. Jacob Barandes was in attendance as well and he asked Gavin if writing the comic gave him the chance to meet any of the people who had previously inspired him. Gavin mentioned that the day before he met the illustrator for V for Vendetta and was subsequently reprimanded by him for publishing his content for free. He also met the creator of Dilbert (Scott Adams?). 

I took a picture with him as well. I am glad I did this. I am glad I responded to a desire which had nothing to do with my academic work. Doing so seemed to, if only momentarily, open my world a bit. And this was necessary because I’ve been spending the past few days suicidally depressed. This state of mind reminded me of the early weeks in August 2014 when I had decided that I would commit suicide and had bought the supplies to do so, but was just waiting for the right moment. 

I woke up this morning recognizing this state of mind, but getting up in spite of it. Ben (our real estate agent) had to show the house to a potential buyer at 10:40AM today so I needed to be gone by then. At Harvard, I spent the day reading articles from the libraries paper copies of The Atlantic and The New Republic (an experience which was a surprisingly relaxing) and I wrote some notes on The Kovacs Effect. It wasn’t impossible to work, but I did it mechanically tacitly admitting that at some point in the near future I would complete the work which was unfinished from last year. 

But I had made plans to go to the book signing and so I went, and now having done so, some hope has seeped into my darkening perspective. [//]


Gestalt Switch of Work
A gestalt switch refers to a perspectival change where a single object can take on conflicting appearances depending on which side of the change you’re on. The switch often occurs by reflexively choosing what aspects of the object to focus on and the way those aspects should be interpreted. 

I have often seen my work in physics in a bad light, and from this perspective I extrapolated that my relationship with physics had deteriorated to the point of stalemate. I wanted nothing to do with it, and it seemed perfectly fine corroborating the disconnect I felt it had with my internal values. But I had not always felt this way, of course. There was a time when I loved physics deeply and almost lasciviously, and given that the subject had not changed surely the difference was in me. 

When I first moved into the Saybrook house, my vision of physics was much improved. After about a year of borderline apathy, I finally saw its beauty and its potential and I solved problems I valued and which were interesting to me. But as the semester crept on, and I attempted to apply this energy in the typical research directions, I gradually lost this vision and began seeing it through the previous deadened eyes. I had undergone a Gestalt switch in my vision of physics, and this switch was precipitated as all are by choosing to focus on particular aspects of the relevant object while ignoring others. 

From my extensive experience in falling into a desultory vision of physics, I have learned (roughly) what one needs to focus on in order for one to see physics as dead and uninteresting. 

You focus on the papers other people have written and how many citations they have, so you can do work in the same vein and garner similar readership. Only think about the potential community wide impact of your work rather than whether you’re interested in the question the work answers. Spend all your time superficially skimming highly cited papers to see if you can conjure your own highly cited papers. View your work only through the lens of the problems the current community of physicists deems as important and significant.

Spend all your time learning physics in popular research areas and ignore the problems you can solve now because they do not qualify as research.

Claim, not through speech but through your unilateral engagement with this type of work, that the only work which has value is work which can be published and highly cited. Disparage, through neglect and disregard, all work which does not accordingly measure up. 

Do your work in an attempt to fit your life within a narrative that you believe is aspirational and will be viewed favorably by historians. That is, live your life according to how you want your life to be written about. 

Or… You could live your life without constantly looking in a mirror to see how that life may be viewed by some distant observer. 

This alternative is one way to enter the other gestalt. Here are more ways: In addition to removing the mirror from your work (and while you’re at it, your life as well), you can focus on the meaning and concepts which develop organically from the work. Pursue work you’re interested in, an interest which is not defined by a rubric and checkmarks but rather is something felt and actively experienced in the moment. Pay attention, and assign value through that attention, to the work you can do now.

Work to see your work outside of the judgmental background you typically create around it.

Look at your work as “just” a contribution to the existing body of science. A contribution which has value independent of the number of citations it will possibly accumulate, or the awards it will receive. A piece of work which cannot properly be evaluated within the context of the past, because it is not specifically an extension of that past. It is work which has value because of the value you derive from pursuing and completing it, and not because of the value you others derive from it or the value you hope it will bestow upon you as an individual.

The key to being able to do this work is engaging with the appropriate gestalt. You spend too long existing within the wrong one, and you will lose your vision of why the work deserves to be completed, and in an attempt to regain that vision, you will work even harder, again within this wrong gestalt, and only further distance yourself from the healthier perspective. Within the context of the goals you hope to achieve, recognize what your priorities of work are, the priorities which if not fulfilled will make achieving the goals impossible, and do not neglect them.

——————

You can work/view your work in one of two ways. You can look at the work of others. The work which was remembered in history. The work of the past, which is still built upon today. And you could say that this is the only work you can do. You can look at your work and judge it according to its possibility of having import or relevance to the future and you could disparage it accordingly if it fails to measure up. You could

Man in the Desert
I imagine a man in a desert chasing an image. It’s possibly an apparition, that subtle combination of mania and reflected light which makes men see things which are not really there. But he believes that what he sees is real. It is far away and in the distance, but the mere possibility of its existence imbues his life with a fulness which gives meaning to the ordeal to this point. And how could something so inspiring not truly be of the world? Maybe, it is only with time and self-application, that he’ll find some way to occupy this image of the future. So he moves forward, today and tomorrow. But as his feet step and sink into the loose sand, and his quadriceps burn in protest, questioning the value of what he seeks, as his eyes strain against the sun, and his skin bristles and breaks, the image appears to move farther away. To make up for lost time, he quickens his pace, but this only makes the image recede ever faster. Soon the image is so faint that it appears as little more than a dot on the horizon, and some time after that he cannot see it at all. Lost and with his guiding star having sunk back into the blackness of space, the man sits down. To where will he go without direction? For what will he live?

He stands up and walks forward, recognizing a futility and purposeless in his movements which although freeing is altogether unfamiliar. He drifts from shadow to light, from morning to dusk. When it is time to sleep, he sleeps, and when he has slept enough, he walks. And after much time of such walking, his body having grown accustomed to the motion, he can walk with his eyes on the landscape, instead of at his feet. And with his eyes on the terrain he sees the cacti, coyote, and the flora and fauna of the desert. All things he saw before, during his former journey. But now he sees their colors and their shapes without the dominating background of the mirage. He sees them and only them and recognizes the beauty therein. He goes from plant to desiccated tree to decaying carcass, noting the diversity of structures of this world. It was a world that he once only saw as a conduit to a better one, and now he recognizes as a world worthy of inspection itself. 

And after months, and years of occupying this world and living it through documentation and attention, one day he stops and sits down again. And looking around he senses an immensity at his back, something large and something he undoubtedly should have noticed before. He turns around and sees it, up close for the first time. The mirage, he first only appeared to see all those years ago, made real and physical before his presence. 

Now, that’s a nice story, an inspiring story, but is it really a true one? It’s certainly something that you like to believe, isn’t it? These seemingly impossible goals that you dream of and that you measure your life’s progress against are actually false and misleading—the proverbial white whale in the narrative of your life. What you’re saying is that you’ll achieve more, and even indirectly achieve the larger goals you seek, by turning away from the mirage in the distance and focusing on the tangibles of the present. But this too is just another narrative, is it not? How sure are you that you’re not substituting one apparently false narrative for another false narrative that is simply easier to live by?
[//]

What is something that appears real and inspiring from far away, but disappears or becomes grotesque/unrecognizable upon close inspection? A mirage? Our post-pubescent ideas about how to live a life? Our political system?
[//]

Perhaps the depression and emptiness you feel when you chase these things are your mind’s way of telling you that these goals are not really important to you. Maybe your mind is saying, “Enough is enough. I can’t devote any more resources, to things which aren’t fundamentally necessary to your fulfillment.”
[//]

White people and white supremacy
White people often can’t see white supremacy because it forms the background to their entire lives. It is the ground upon which they stand, simultaneously fundamental to the world they occupy and also taken for granted because it is seemingly irrelevant to the internal and external forces they engage with every day. And while white supremacy forms the invisible backdrop of life for white people, it exists as a glaring implacable wall for those who could never call themselves or be called “white”. Thus in America white people and non-white people can often occupy different worlds where lived experiences do not intersect and consequently the arguments which are based on them never really make contact with those originating from the opposite realm. 

There is nothing fundamental about this wall, nothing in our physical or biological world which demands its existence. In America, and in the western world we have constructed it to give us a foundational identity in the absence of any other definitive indication of such an identity. This is despairing of course. To recognize that so much existential pain is not really fundamental to living as the many anglo saxon philosophers of old claimed it was. Instead this pain is created by us and maintained by the institutions we believe are required for our society. Of course, this too, the fact that we created this world, is not wholly tragic because it points precisely to where the agency lies. 

A Possible Comic (In the style of the “What is water?” Fish comic): 

How’s life in our patriarchal white supremacist society, boys?

(A Beat Passes)

What’s patriarchal white supremacy?

To the defendants: It’s not that all the overcome challenges and accomplishments in your life can be invalidated by the existence of a racial hierarchy in our culture, but by recognizing that such a hierarchy exists these achievements could be better contextualized and thus better understood. It may then be easier to see and accept the fundamental truth, rarely discussed and even less seldom acknowledged in this country, that our lives are subject to and determined by a multitude of factors many of which are entirely out of our control.


—-

There is perhaps a clear reason white people feel a reflexive need to reject the implications if not the idea of white supremacy. It is maybe because they realize that the people discussing the idea are saying something they cannot possibly see as true, namely these people are saying “My pain is greater than your pain.” Such a claim is one that all people regardless of race have no choice but to deem as suspect because, no matter the affordances of human empathy, our own pain always feels more real than the pain of other people.

Running List of Lessons From Kovacs Project

When I complete the Kovacs project, I am going to write a post-script essay the way I wrote them for my previous (three(!)) data science projects. Here’s a running list of points I want to include in the essay. 

About Science Projects in General 
Self determination is key: I feel like this project never really got off the ground until I admitted to myself that Amir really wasn’t going to devote as much time to it as I was. This was a lesson I learned in the past, but I have found it difficult to incorporate into my work in graduate school. 
Weekly Schedule is needed: Victor did a really good thing in our data science work. He said that we should meet every week on Friday. This meant that on Thursday/Friday morning I would always be working and if I missed a work deadline I felt bad enough about it to work more during the following weekend.
You are Manic-Depressive/Bipolar/Crazy: You probably won’t remember the number of weeks you spent not working in October. It was pretty much from the last week in September to the middle of October. And before then, there were times that you were so intoxicated with the possibilities of your work that you imagined Nobel prizes and MacArthur fellowships. Yea so you need to work on this ish. 

More on science
Phenomenology is weird: I really hated the parameter fitting parts of the project. This leads me to want to avoid such projects in the future.
New model of question formulation in science: In this project the goal pretty much remained the same throughout the project (Attempt to describe the Kovacs effect with a multimode summation formalism)

The Problems with the Comparison
You shouldn’t judge your ability to do the work according to the confusion you feel while you’re doing it. All of these books and research papers represent finished products. You have no access to how these products were actively created. You don’t know if the paragraph on page 3 took the author three days or three minutes to get right, and so when it takes you a week to understand the sentence on page 5 and you think you’re stupid because of it, you’re measuring yourself according to an imaginary and likely false standard. Listen, stop paying so much attention to how much trouble you’re having working through the process. Stop holding a mirror up to yourself and seeing if you look the way you’re supposed to. Just focus on what is real and actionable: the work. [//]


Ted Radio Hour: The Source of Creativity - September 25, 2015
Guy Roz: The idea here is that practice doesn’t make you perfect, but it does help you stop thinking that you have to be.” 

Charles Lem: Yea, I think that’s true. I would say that anytime external influences are interfering with your brain’s ability to just generate something new it is putting additional cognitive load on your brain that changes the way it’s normally meant to generate new ideas. I think for art, and for high level flow states, the ability to suppress your own brain…the ability to get out of their way [is what makes the art possible].

“Done” on paper is better than “good” in your head. 
Paraphrased Elizabeth Gilbert
[//]

The only real way to combat these feelings of insecurity is by doing the work itself. 

What your mind tells you when you see good technical work done by other people
You should stop trying, since you will never be able to do work like this. 

Since you don’t understand all the steps, and arguments in the work, you’ll never be able to do good work even if it’s not like this. 


Answers which combat the narrative your mind develops
You don’t need to be able do the kind of good technical work you see, in order to do good work. 

Even if your work isn’t as “good” in your mind as the work you see, doesn’t mean that it shouldn’t be completed. 

You don’t need to understand everything in a paper in order to: one, appreciate it; two, be able to use and adapt some of the paper’s results; and three be able to write your own papers.

TED Radio Hour: The Source of Creativity

And what I discovered over the years is not that you have to be fearless…I think what you have to do is recognize that fear and creativity are conjoined twins, and what I see people doing in their lives is they’re so afraid of their fear that they end up trying to kill it, and when they kill it they also kill their creativity because creativity is going into the uncertain and the uncertain is always scary. 

And so what I had to figure out how to do is create a mental construct where I create a lot of space to coexist with fear, to say to it “Hey fear, listen. Creativity and I, your conjoined twin sister, are about to go on a road trip. I understand you’ll be joining us (Laughter) because you always do. But you don’t get to decide anything about this journey that we’re going on, but you can come and I know you’ll be in the back seat in panic (Laughter) but we’re going anyway.

…

The rest of the time for me it’s just been about showing up everyday for the work. And I find that actually what happens is that you begin the work just from a place of diligence and discipline and then if you’re lucky, through that process, you’ll have moments where inspiration will come in and meet you. And what that feels like to me is that it feels like I’m lugging my suitcase through a giant airport terminal and then all of a sudden I’m on one of those movable sidewalks. So I’m being assisted, and I’m still walking I’m still working, I’m still carrying my suitcase, but it’s easier. And then that movable sidewalk ends and then it comes again and then it ends, but I keep moving regardless of whether the sidewalk is moving under me. That’s how I feel about my work. 

Guy Ross: I’m just sort of imagining you…trying to write something and just hitting a wall where you feel like you’re not tapping into your best most creative self. And that can last a long time, that can last days weeks, months. 

Gilbert: It can but motion works. And moving towards motion means do something—

Ross: Even if the creative output that day just sucks(?)

Gilbert: Yea that’s fine. Most days it does. And I think I’m also lucky that my mom had this adage that we grew up with in our house hold which is “Done is better than good.” Like, you win already just by having shown up. That’s a victory enough. 

…

…we keep telling people to follow their passion, and I feel like that can be an intimidating and almost cruel thing to say to people at times. Because first of all if somebody has one central powerful burning passion, they’re probably already following it because that’s sort of the definition of passion, that you don’t have a choice. And if you don’t, which is a lot of people, and some body tells you to follow your passion, I think you have the right to give them the finger (Laughter). Because it just makes you feel worse. So what I say to people is if you don’t have an obvious passion forget about it. Follow your curiosity. Because passion is sort of a tower of flame that is not always accessible. And curiosity is something anybody can access any day. Your curiosity may lead you to your passion or it may not. It may have been for quote-on-quote nothing in which case all you’ve done all your life is spend your existence in pursuit of the things that made you feel curious or inspired and that should be good enough. 




Elizabeth Gilbert







The process of writing is like digging a hole. The first few cracks at a hard cold earth are the most difficult. You work seemingly with no consequence, to pry away the stones and compacted mud to reveal some possibly accessible region. The shovel works and it is through the force of habit that it continues on because surely there is nothing in the immediate present of the world which suggests that its work has meaning. But as the shovel breaks the terra firma again and again and churns the dried mud into brittle and fluffy soil, the subterranean world hidden beneath the clay opens up to you. Soon, the shovel plunges with ease and polish. You work with a simplicity akin to merely existing. You’re riding something, you can tell, but if you are not careful you can forget your history and believe that the way you are now is the only state of work possible. You can forget the difficult initial fight against inertia before momentum carried you away. And if you forget, you will leave your digging site one day, return the next day to find a level and apparently unperturbed piece of land, and you will wonder why the caverns you created so easily in the past, do not spontaneously appear before you as was their habit.

Why is it difficult to write
Why is it difficult to start writing, to simply place an acceptable sequence of words on a blank page? I’ve written hundreds of essays and a few short stories and no matter how many I write, it feels like it never gets any easier. 

But working on my fellowship essays and watching what was happening to my mind somewhat internally, I think I’ve come closer to an idea of why starting is difficult. 

It’s because when you start with a blank page, without any material to act upon, revise or edit, you are beginning at a place of profound ego-dominance. At this point, the initiation of the work is entirely in your hands, and your mind, if only unconsciously, quite correctly surmises you are not quite up to the task of starting it the way it should be started. You just aren’t good enough, and that fact lays solid and sordid in front of you. And just like that, the thing you were supposed to write about becomes about you instead of it. It becomes about how you can’t quite describe it the way you feel it needs to be described, about how you’re not good enough, and how you won’t amount to anything and so you are stuck. 

But, if you find some way to work past this cognitive block—that is, if you continue to write in spite of your feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness—you eventually make contact with something which resonates with you. It’s usually something which you recognize has a truth in the world which exists outside your self. And all of a sudden this truth eclipses your fear of failure and worthlessness, and you can’t help but pursue it and leave behind the insecurity which first impeded you. And as you continue to write, your sense of ego becomes smaller and smaller until all that remains before you is the work that you continue to try to uncover regardless of you own measure of competency. 

The process of starting and entering into an episode of work is a process of losing the constant weight of egocentrism and replacing it with a working selflessness, one that allows one to see and pursue with clarity the work which needs to be done without a constant reference to our own abilities to do it. 

Because the truth of the matter is that it is irrelevant whether you think you’re good enough. It is even irrelevant whether you are actually good enough. The work will be done at the level you can do it, so outside of some need to compete with other people your own sense of worth is not relevant. The work isn’t about your own abilities. Speaking in a truism, the work is about the work. 

[//]

Work is the mechanical expiation of egotism. It is the process of forgetting the self, and trying to build a more sound definition of identity through one’s relation to something more eternal than the self. This is immediately evident in academic disciplines which attempt to extend human knowledge, but it is also true in art. The timelessness of fiction arises from the way it discusses fundamental truths about the human condition within the context of a stories whose details may have no mirror in the actual world.

Solutions to the Unperturbed One-Body Problem? The Parametrization of Loneliness? Loneliness in the Aggregated Communities of Scholars? A Discourse in the Parameters of Loneliness?

A Discourse On Solutions to the Unperturbed One-Body Problem

I closed my eyes and lifted my head. The flakes of snow dropped like wet pieces of confetti. I couldn’t escape them. And they welcomed me like I was one of their own. But I wasn’t. Each one was part of a contingent, all falling from the same cloud, all descending upon the same denizens of a dark city. They were together. I was alone. And the difference was manifest. 

I turned up my collar, and stepped backward underneath the bus stop cover. The seats were damp, so I chose to stand. I looked out onto Mass Ave, blurring my eyes as if the world looked as hazy as it felt to me. I would tell you some bull shit like it’s been two years since Sasha broke up with me. Or a month since I left Fiona. Or two days since I slept with Charlotte. The smell of her pillow, her kitchen, or her backpack, lingering in spite of each one’s absence. But this would be a lie, because these women are not real. They are just characters who populate my fiction, characters who only exist to parametrize and outline the loneliness I feel, characters who can do nothing to eradicate it. 

The 86 to Cleveland Circle bus idled on the other side of street. The light flashed from red to green and it began to move. The people surrounding me at this bus stop stepped forward and lemming like I stepped with them. One girl hustled herself in front of me and I was snapped out of my reverie. She was rushing to be one of the first onto the nearly empty bus. How small, I wondered, must her life be that finding that perfect seat on the bus can be made to feel so necessary? I stepped back, manifesting on the side walk the psychological distance I felt from her. 

As I stepped onto the bus I said good evening to the bus driver. The evening was not a good one. None of them were. The winter had become brown and tired like all Boston winters do and I was still in that mental hibernation that came after October and before March every year. 

I remembered, for apparently no reason at all, the time when I lived in New Orleans after I graduated from high school. I worked at the Advanced Materials Research Institute in UNO and I drove to work in the morning each day. And closer to the end of the summer, when the days spent alone at a work bench seemed to flow too easily into the days spent alone at home at a desk, I would drive across the Crescent City connection and in the middle think about stopping the green Saturn station wagon, stepping outside of it and onto the concrete slab dividing the road from the air and water below and…

I was shoved from behind, light but unmistakable. I inserted my monthly bus pass into the ticket reader. It went in and out and in and out and in and finally out again. I took it and found my seat. Somewhere close to the side exit of the bus, but far from and in front of the girl I had been absentmindedly staring at on the waiting platform. Her hair was black large and curly and partly sealed under a red cap. She had no backpack and no purse. Only a light blue jacket vest covering some leotard like outfit. When I was outside I could only see her from the back, but when I entered the bus I saw her face. She was looking out into the street, and she reminded me of Katherine the EECS sophomore I met while I was a freshman living in MacGregor. 

I took off my hat and checked my phone. There were two messages from “Steve”. I don’t know why I put that in quotation marks. It probably is his real name. His email seemed too earnest, too despairing to have any element of falseness. But then again, he did lie to me about his age. 

I blame our media saturated culture that people in real life rarely look the age we think they are. Or maybe it’s just me. When I was 19 I was told I look much, much older. And so maybe my eyes forced to look at my face each day and reconcile the image before them with the facts reported by the calendar can’t help but look at the rest of the world through the distortions of my own physiognomy. So people who are 30 can look 24. And the guy on Craigslist who says he’s 40 could really be 50. 

He wanted to meet. I didn’t. How could I meet someone who was closer to my dad’s age than mine? Someone who has been on this earth twice as long as I have? I know how years can accumulate like a forgotten debt, something you wish will go away or at least become innocuous through neglect, but which only grows and grows tumor-like. And I know how we can become people we never imagined we’d be. And I know the philosophy which argues against discrimination and the justice of seeing the person beyond the superficial characteristics by which they’re labeled. But what I felt was what I felt.

It was revealing. Is this what happened when I messaged a guy and sent him a picture? Is this why he disappeared. Because the image of who I was could not fit somehow within the spectrum of physical features of people he could connect with? This is my rationalization of my own loss. Perhaps the silence has a simpler explanation. 

“So we can never talk again?” Steve sent to me. I pressed the button on the side of my phone, dimming it to darkness. I searched my pockets for my Ipod Nano. The trappings of civilization are certainly sweet even if they never provide the spiritual sustenance they implicitly claim to. I scrolled to the podcast series “Love & Radio” and listened to the episode “Greetings from Coney Island”. A woman living in our modern times receives letters from the 1950s. They’re from a man who claims to know her and claims she is a time traveler. To call it a hoax is to be callously incomplete. The story cycles through various relationships this woman has had in real life, and eventually the essential plot is revealed. The letters come not from her current boyfriend, or even indirectly a former boyfriend. They come from an artist friend of a former boyfriend. The artist coordinated a letter series where creative and idiosyncratic letters could be sent to a desired party. Apparently this ex-boyfriend thought the narrator would enjoy it. 

The girl with the large black hair got up and exited the bus from the side. I saw it in the reflection of the bus panel windows. I was nearly home, and I thought about what I would do once I got there. I would watch an hour of “The Leftovers”, contemplate the parochial narcissism of a wealthy country which is nakedly obsessed with post-apocalyptic TV dramas, read twenty pages of “Song of Solomon” and go to sleep. I haven’t worked in weeks, and I don’t plan on breaking that streak. 

After the bus stop right before my own, I press the red button signaling to the driver that here is where I want to get off. But as the doors opened, I stayed where I was. For some reason I couldn’t move. The doors closed again and the bus continued down Market St. I took out my earbuds to listen to the sounds of the bus. There was the intermittent rev of the engine, the quasi-robotic human voice on the intercom “Please make seating available to persons with disabilities” and “Stop Requested.” There is a way that focusing on the world and quietly and softly paying attention to the stories it contains can reveal to you a beauty you never before acknowledged. This was not one of those ways. 

The bus had driven more than four stops when I decided I was far enough from home. I got off at the corner of Commonwealth and Chestnut Hill Ave. It was along the route I ran when warmer climes were about. I could either back track and walk along the route the bus had just driven through, or go up Commonwealth Ave before turning onto some other street which connected me to my own. But I didn’t know which way to go, so I just stood there swiping snow flakes off the screen of my Ipod as I looked for some episode loud enough to drown out the (screaming) silence inside me.

October 28, 2015 Thursday 1:34 AM Saybrook House
There is something about the living of an experience which cannot be captured through writing. No matter how skilled the writer and no matter how simple the experience, something is lost in conveying the experience through the written word. But we feel writing is good when it seems to lie so close to an experience that even if we do not feel the burn of it, we can feel its warmth. 

So if I tell you I was suicidal, you recognize at an emotional level that this is bad writing because it elicits nothing from you. But if I describe the moment when the conviction to end my life was made solid, and the way I searched the internet for methods, the website I found, and then the grade of bullets and type of gun I could use (all under $300 because that’s all I had in my bank account), and then the days in wait, and distance, and the letter I wrote to my parents and sister… With this description you are still quite far from the experiential nature of my ideation, but it feels more real to you than the adjective alone. 

So if I describe my life now, you future reader, may nod your head in sympathy but don’t delude yourself into believing you truly understand. Don’t attempt to reduce the experience I relate to something which has a “solution”, something which would not have occurred with the right perspective. You, even if you have lived this experience, in the moment where you are now do not and cannot possibly understand. Any comprehension you have would be abstracted and unreal, theoretical knowledge which is rendered useless in the face of the thing which you study. Because what is happening to me is not entirely conscious. Something inside me is resisting my own will, it opposes any attempt to engage with intent. And this unconscious aspect of the experience, is in a way the entire experience itself. It is the thing I cannot conjure up or destroy. I am bound to it, as surely as you are not. So don’t pretend to understand. Listen, and take solace perhaps, but don’t patronize your past. 

It’s 2 AM on a Thursday. By Friday at 8 PM I need to submit my NSF application. I have not started on the research statement. This does not mean that I will not eventually complete one. It only means that the one I complete will be crappy. I also have not completed my personal statement. Part of me is hugely apathetic in this regard. Another part of me cares, but is doing so quietly. To and for what am I living my life? Each day this week I woke up feeling emptier than I felt the previous day. I sit on the bus and the people there annoy me, by their very existence. I feel lonely. Hugely so. And each day it gets worse. I can’t think of a good way to convey this feeling to you. It’s like you live in a house with a large amount of furniture, couches and lamps which you never bought but merely collected from your lived experience of life. And each day when you come back home you find a piece of furniture missing. This day it’s the painting from the street vendor outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the next day it’s your tennis shoes. Until, after many months your house is empty and inside it’s just you and this hunger for something which is lost and which you have no idea how to find again. 

I really don’t know how to make peace with this loneliness. It has made work impossible. It is something which demands satiation, but I seem to lack the resources and skills to satiate it. I go to Harvard each day and I feel trapped within the campus. I go to the Science Center Library, the Law School Library, Lamont Library, Dudley Library, the Andover-Theological Library, and now I realize the intent of all this motion was to escape this feeling which has been stuck to me for years. And I cannot seem to escape it. It cannot be directly addressed and it cannot be fled. What choice do I have but to let it devour me?

This upcoming Monday I’m going to go on anti-depressants. The choice I realize concerns what kind of statistic I will be for it’s too late for me not to become one. Will I be another tick mark in the list of suicides attached to Harvard’s and MIT’s name? Or will I become another stereotype of our current overmedicated culture? People on anti-depressants do commit suicide, however, so maybe I can be both.

Lies
It’s not at all true that the writing is not about you. It certainly sounds nice, but it’s not completely accurate. If you haven’t eaten all day and then you try to write, and you are unable to do so because hunger constantly distracts you, then your writer’s block is certainly about you. And there are more types of human responses to need than a mere hunger for food. How can you say that they cannot pull you away from an intense engagement with your writing as easily as hunger can?

[//]

To all my past selves: I’m sorry I pretended to understand your pain. I think I just so desperately wanted to believe that if I could understand your pain, I could somehow also understand and overcome my own. What is that thing I mentioned in the past: we really want control, but in lieu of it we settle for understanding and in the absence of understanding we simply pretend that we do understand and try to forget that we’re pretending. It’s not an excuse, but it should be clear I was operating under a common but false human tendency.

A Good Problem
The simplest theoretical model of a polymer is an ideal chain. Polyvinyl acetate is a polymer with glass-like properties one of which is the non-monotonic relaxation termed the Kovacs effect. Thus an interesting question is in what ways do models of ideal chains exhibit non-monotonic relaxation. However, this may not be a good question because you have no idea how to answer it. But you do know how to answer simple exercise like questions involving ideal chains and phenomenological descriptions of the Kovacs effect. And therein lies the real work of the investigation, finding some way to connect the easy calculations you know how to do with the larger more interesting question which is worth solving. 




 The Closed Off Girl
She was pretty enough, but I couldn’t say I was attracted to her. She just seemed so closed off. I would see her in the hallway and she would pretend not to see me. After class she would rush off to the elevators precluding any conversation. If we were ever within five feet of each other she would stand silently looking straight ahead. In all, it was like I would have had to scale a smooth ten foot wall in order to get to know her and I just didn’t (and still don’t) know how to do that. 
	But in class, as long as we were talking about the subject material she seemed open and receptive.

Be Not Afraid: Useless
	Think about the time you were about to attend Harvard. The time you were deciding whether to join Nu Delta. The time you became pledge trainer. Your project with Reasoning Mind. Your data science final project. Your decision to move to Brighton. Your road trip down the eastern seaboard. In each situation you faced a fear so paralyzing and consuming that you fell into a depression. And yet when you followed through with these events and decisions and tried to meet them as best as you could, your world expanded. 
	In the city of ember, the citizens live in a small cave where the lights only extend so far. Beyond the light is a pure blackness the contents of which none of the citizens can well imagine. That blackness is your fear. It comes from the uncertainty of having to survive in a space you have never lived in before. You think of it and your mind recognizes it is not safe because it represents a story you have never lived, and so you cannot easily imagine yourself living it positively. 
	I once said that if I had one past piece of advice for a past self it would be “Be Not Afraid”. This I now realize is ridiculous. We can’t choose not to be afraid. And sometimes the fear is so overwhelming that we have limited options as to our response to it. But in the spaces when such options exist, therein lies the truth I believe I was getting at. The advice should not be “be not afraid”, but rather “do not let fear demarcate your sense of possibility”.[//]

Statistical Physics Models
Is there a way we could study a mathematical model where the Hamiltonian is drawn from the binomial distribution or incorporates the distribution in some way?

The Tortoise and the Hare
The story of the tortoise and the hare does not merely represent a lesson in patience and constancy over speed or humility over pride. It is arguing for a fundamental shift in the way work is viewed and completed. I think it’s possible to interpret the story in a way different from its standard interpretation. Instead of looking at his entire journey from the starting tree to the barn, and deciding on a strategy of slow and continuous work all the way to the end, I think the tortoise may have been less presumptive of his abilities. Instead, he may have simply thought of getting to the bush at the end of the grove because he knew he could get there. And then once he arrived at the grove he possibly looked at Mrs. Hedgehog’s house and realized it was not too far away and chosen it as his next destination. And so on and so on. The tortoise didn’t egotistically conceptualize a journey he was not sure if he complete, but he worked in concrete directions towards that vision by only in the moment focusing on what he could do next. 
	The hare however viewing the entire journey and his competitor immediately, judged them both incorrectly and adopted a wrong strategy. His results could have been much improved had he set his goals locally and chained such goals together.   
	Thus within the story there is also the lesson of focusing specifically on the goals in front of you, goals you know you can achieve, rather than attempting to think of some grandiose effort that only egotism could induce you into believing you could finish. [//]

Ways to Understand Depression
It is like a waking dream. Not only in the way your mind feels fuzzy and not-completely there when you’re in a dream, but also in the way your conscious mind doesn’t have complete control over its environment. In a dream, the unconscious largely dictates the laws by which the world operates and your consciousness can only choose how to operate within the system of laws the unconscious creates. So too in depression. Since the terms of engagement with the world are set by unconscious (and sometimes merely biochemical) factors not at all in our control, our conscious will cannot really control how we’re feeling or the energy we have to confront certain problems. As a result, in some circumstances our agency can be so limited as to be inexistent. 
It’s like that five minute period before you go to sleep. That period of lethargy and slight stupor. Having to go through your entire day like that simulates the mindset of a depressed person.
What is also problematic is the fact that you don’t feel any emotional connection to anything and often emotional impulse is the fuel which allows us to take on and meet challenges in life. I think most of the American population hates math so the following example should resonate with some people. If you disliked math in school, it’s likely that you also disliked completing your math homework. In essence doing your math homework elicited very little positive response from you and possibly your math homework was made even more difficult as a result. Recognizing this you probably knew you should limit the number and difficulty of math courses you take, simply because the desire was not there to learn the subject. But imagine you were placed in a linear algebra or differential equations course. You would probably hate your courses because the work would be very difficult, and you wouldn’t have the internal emotional impetus to complete it. Having to overcome obstacles which feel meaningless and require a large amount of exertion typify the depressed experience. Again the depressed person is not choosing to feel this way about his experiences (in the same way someone is not choosing to dislike math). It’s something which is conveyed to him through his environment.  







Basic questions
Simple model of a Solid: non equilibrium dynamics of a solid. If we cool a solid what do its dynamics look like? How would we even define an order parameter in such a situation. 
Wrong Direction: what do the kovacs curves look like when we are raising temperature instead of lowering it?
Hysteresis and Amir: how can we define a hysteresis like effect using this multi-modal model?
Hysteresis via Prados: How can we apply the non-equilibrium analysis of prados to models of hysteresis
Modeling Thermal History: The macroscopic order parameter depends on the thermal history. We can define this mathematically by writing M(T(t)). Is there a way to find a formalism which allows us to compute M(t) directly from T(t)? My guess is it would depend on polynomials of T(t) or derivatives of T(t) each of which is multiplied by some time dependent function. 
Microscopic Models: Why are there no microscopic models of this effect?
Non linear Periodics: Is there a way to study non-linear periodic phenomena with Fourier Series? It seems we’ll have to do something similar with this work.
Percolation and Kovacs: All of wikipedia’s descriptions of hysteresis sound a lot like percolation. Either wikipedia’s authors are confusing the two or hysteresis is related to percolation. This would mean the Kovacs effect is related to percolation. 
Microscopic Model and Effective Field Theory: There is this idea in statistical physics called universality. Specifically it refers to the fact that wholy distinct systems can exhibit the same physical results if they share symmetry (and other?) classes. Amir’s paper with Oreg suggests their are materials with the logarithmic aging property. Is there a way we could encompass such models under the Kovacs effect?

*slowly*


If we focus on the change or action we can affect in the present, and merely focus on the present (and not even on the way these present strung together define a macroscopic piece of time), then time cooperates with us to help us complete our work.

On Time and Work
I’ve thought of a good analogy for the lesson “incremental work over grand vision”

You are like a painter sitting without a paddle in a boat on a river. Along one of the banks of the river is a large canvas extending many meters into the distance, and on this canvas you want to paint a mural. The current of the river will carry you along at the same rate no matter what you do. Without a paddle you cannot fight or encourage your boat’s progress through the water. Since all you can do is allow the river to take you along as it may, the only way to add to the mural is to focus on the section of the canvas before you. Earlier sections can never be touched again and later sections are inaccessible in the moment. You can only affect what is currently in the vicinity of the boat. But incredibly the entire mural can be painted that way. 

I’ve realized I incorrectly interpreted my previous work. Whenever I finished a long essay or a long calculation in physics, I always saw it as a monolith, as this single large thing that I accomplished. In reality, it was never completed as a monolith and more often than not envisioning the work as a whole and thinking about all I had to do to implement that vision had paralyzed me and made me incapable of working at all. It was only by working towards small objectives and subtly ignoring the distance I still had to go that I was able to do the incremental work that was necessary. 

Time will flow regardless of what we do. We are passive actors in this sense. But in order to do work, we can make use of the passive flow of time. When we pay primary attention to the work we can complete in the present (instead of focusing on the entirety of the work), time works with us, like the river in the example of the painter, carrying us along and allowing our work to accumulate as long as we maintain the same present minded perspective. But when we focus on the entirety of the work, time becomes an enemy, a constraint of reality we must fight against in order to finish our work. In such a framing, time always wins because as a constraint of reality it is without volition and thus can never truly be conquered. 

This is one reason why the depressive mind is so insidious. Depression is often exacerbated by your focus on the distance between your vision of how your life should be and how your life currently is. And so as depression takes you out of your current place in time, it diminishes your agency not only by removing your motivation but also by making you incapable of fully working within the moments of life you can affect. 

But what defines the present? A naive definition would be a second, since that is the smallest unit we use to measure time every day. But of course the length of time we label as a second is arbitrary, and so a definition of present based on it is similarly so. This gives us freedom in how we define what is the present. In terms of work, the present can be seen as any piece of time long enough for you to make some concrete step in your work. For writing, for example, a possible concrete step is a sentence, so the present would be defined to be about thirty seconds or less. For technical work, a possible concrete step is a calculation or a line of code so the present would be defined as a minute or more. So when working, you limit your vision to what you can complete according to your measure of the present and let anything which extends beyond that present fall to the background. 

When working it is not that you constantly say to yourself “I’m going to work for the next minute,” and then when that minute is over you say it again and so on. It’s more so that you recognize the truth in the philosophy of focusing on the present and this recognition relieves some of the anxiety which usually grips your work and makes it easier to concentrate on the work you can do in the next minute.

Lessons from Completing the NSF Essays

Yesterday I completed and submitted my NSF application. Completing the work was more difficult than I anticipated and if you’re reading this years or even months down the line, you probably don’t appreciate how difficult it was. It’s OK. I don’t always appreciate the gifts of work past versions of myself bestowed upon me either. But I’m getting away from the point. By working on the essays I learned two lessons: One a lesson about myself, and the other a lesson about work in general.

Miscalculated Work Ethic Re-dux: Throughout October, on any given day, I repeatedly overestimated the amount of work I could do. I would tell myself I would write 500 words towards an essay, complete my Yoruba homework, and work on the Kovacs project, but after filling my writing quota I would feel too intellectually exhausted to do anything else. It was not merely a question of will power. Transitioning into a writing mindset was all-consuming and I found it difficult to think about or plan for other work after the writing was complete. 

The result was that I constantly fell behind my writing goals, and the density of work I still had to do before the end of October, instead of decreasing, seemed only to grow This was demoralizing and I often watched TV-series and short movies in order to relieve the mental tension of constantly feeling as though I was failing. Of course this only worsened the situation. 

I have always had this problem, and I think I always will. The work I plan for myself will not always align exactly with the work I can do, no matter how solid my planning. But I can become better at planning so that the distance between the two is less, and I can become better at accepting this distance so that its existence does not make me unwilling to bridge it. 

But beyond my estimation of the amount of work I could do, I also failed to understand the experiences which supplied a sort of psychic fuel for that work. There were many days when I felt completely depleted of will. Cognitively, I felt clear headed, but there was no motivation to write. This happened last Tuesday for example. The Bok center session (“Making it Stick”) was from 2 to 4pm, and afterwards I went to Dudley library and endeavored to complete my personal statement for the NSF application. But, even given my previous insight that “work is the mechanical expiation of egotism”, I could not write. I instead read articles on the Atlantic (one on the efforts to improve academic writing), and watched short movies on shortoftheweek.com. I felt burned out and it was like my mind was searching for something to replenish what was lost. Ultimately, I wrote “A Discourse on Solutions to the One-body problem” as a way to explain what was missing

I really burn out a lot. I think it’s because I don’t know (or ignore) the things which can fuel my work. And the solution to this problem comes from what burning out feels like. It feels like a deep alienation not only from the values which led me to do the work, but also from other people. And although there are many times when being around people was psychically draining, there were also times when it was fulfilling. Ultimately, going to the mindfulness session on Thursday seemed to revive something in me. After talking about some of the antecedents of loneliness and ways to cope with anxiety, my mind opened slightly and i was finally able to work. 

This means I need to change the way I interact with people. Perhaps if I find a way to engage with them while presenting myself more honestly, I would enjoy this engagement more.

Incremental Work Over Grand Vision: The only way I was able to complete this work was by constantly thinking of and then focusing on what I could easily do in the next few seconds. Not what I did a minute ago or what I had to do a minute from now, and certainly not what I had to do to write the entire essay. But just the smallest thing I could do in the next moment. Because I didn’t know how to write the entire essay, but I knew how to write a sentence which could fit within it. And incredibly by stringing many such sentences together, I was able to write the entire thing. 

It was Thursday, past midnight, when I was working on the NSF Research Proposal. I had written a few choppy paragraphs towards it, and my work had ground to a halt. After I spent a few minutes staring at the page, and failing to telepathically conjure words to fill it, I decided to compromise. Instead of trying to deal with how to organize the rest of the paper as a whole, I would just try to populate the works cited page. Doing so was mechanical, algorithmic and thus gave me something concrete to focus on. When I completed that, I then needed to find the places in the paper where I referenced the citations. This too was also algorithmic and was completed easily in turn. Then I applied the same mindset (that of doing something small and simple and concrete) to trying to add a sentence to a paragraph. 

There are two related ideas here. First, is the idea of presence in work. Namely, your time scale for work is greatly shortened. Instead of telling yourself, you will concentrate on work for an hour (which would place the time scale at the forefront of your mind and make it difficult to work), you say you will concentrate for only five minutes, not thinking at all what will happen afterwards. You do this continually, from moment to moment, and as time marches along your curtailed time window soon spans your entire period of work. 

(Argument: 
Abiola: In some sense I get what you’re saying, but in another sense it’s like you’re tricking yourself. If you’re going to work for an hour, you’ll work for an hour regardless of what you tell yourself. 

Gutierrez: What I’m saying is not to focus on the clock. There is a way you can work which is continually present in what you’re doing and hence has no sense of time. That’s what I’m advocating.

Abiola: But what I’m saying is that it’s inevitable that some time component will enter that. 

Gutierrez: It will only enter if you take yourself out of a focus on the work. It’s like this: just focus on what you have to do next, and do that. Don’t think about anything else)

Second, is the idea of working on something small and concrete. When thinking about work you have to do, it’s typical/habitual to place the entirety of the work in the forefront of your mind. You focus on your ideal of what a finished work is, and you hope that through such focus, you’ll devise a plane to fulfill the ideal. But I find this to not all be productive (indeed it’s often debilitating). Instead, I think it’s better to find something concrete you can do in the moment which works in the direction of your vision.
	
It’s not that you don’t think about the larger goal. It’s just that you don’t focus on it. You focus on the work you can do right in front of you and keep the larger goal way in the background. 

The lesson about time can be summarized as: If we focus on the change or action we can affect in the present, and merely focus on the present (and not even on the way these present moments strung together define a macroscopic piece of time), then time cooperates with us to help us complete our work.

The lesson about time is new, but the lesson about focusing on a small concrete piece of work first is something I’ve learned many times in the past. You’ll find it echoed in all of my post-scripts on my Python projects and many of my physics projects. But it seems that like a poor student, I didn’t fully internalize the essence of what I learned and I didn’t faithfully practice the knowledge in new situations. 

2:32 PM 
Improved Perspectives
The following are positive ways of viewing you work and life. They can be practiced so that they become habits. 

Practicing mind: the idea that you can improve. That where you currently are is a good state even if you are curious about or want something that lies beyond it. That practice never stops and is in fact coincident with performance. 

Done is better than good: a philosophy which places a primacy of values within reality as it is actively experienced. It is the claim that what exists in the world deserves to be appreciated as it is, even more so than what has yet to be created. 

Working with time: focusing on the work you do within the present and allowing time to collect these presents together to create the larger work you want to do.

The Myopia of Depression


Depression slotted me into a myopia which cut me off from my former versions of self and made me believe that if I was being rejected in the moment then it must have meant that I was truly worthy of rejection. Gone were my opinions and values. Gone was any sense of identity not bestowed by the ambient environment. Gone were the personal histories where I had overcome challenges so great and so frequent that obstacles were no longer obstacles but had become mere seeds for affirmations of character. Depression chopped and filleted the narrative of my life and rendered all those past selves inaccessible, and before I realized what happened, I was trapped in a hysterical present which turned all pain into suffering, forever greying my past and forever sequestering me from any worthwhile future.

The tunnel vision of depression makes it impossible to place events within a story set a part from your own insecurities. Worst of all, you constantly lose sight of yourself and then end up searching externally for confirmation of an identity you once believed was your own. But the external perspective is always the superficial perspective, one born of caricature and prejudice, one which your psychological immune system would easily combat if it were working properly. So to take this external perspective as a basis for identity is not merely incorrect, it is cancerous. The effect is to lead you to internalize a vision of yourself which is self destructive, and once you commit to that vision, your unconscious mind quietly works to affirm it in everything you do.

Sexlessa
So I started celexa yesterday. I’ve only taken two pills, but I find that I’m yawning more and my mouth feels weird, symptoms I probably wouldn’t have noticed well enough to comment upon had they not been listed with the medication. Another symptom is a reduced sex-drive, so you know, I’m crossing my fingers for that one. 

 After attending the teaching seminar “Make it Stick”, it also seems that I’m able to speak more clearly and without anxiety. It was so strange to hear myself give a presentation and not have a wellspring of tension halting and fighting my words. But my speech, if at all clear, comes out somewhat robotically, devoid of any authentic emotional tenor. And it doesn’t feel like me. It’s like I’m being possessed by some other more calm entity. But it’s been two days; it’s really too soon to notice anything. So these effects must surely be all in my head.  

In other news I just remembered that I discovered my mom was on anti-depressants when I was in New Orleans during 2014. I initially told myself that I was just now discovering this but this can’t be true. I remember being in a deep depressive episode and finding some pills of citalopram in the kitchen. I looked up what they were used for and I took one in the hopes of some relief. Of course, as foggy minded and thoughtless as I was, I didn’t read deeply enough to note that they take weeks to build up to full effect. I just despaired that another attempt at a fix failed. 

But now the more relevant question is when did my mom start taking them? Do I remember noticing a change in mood which may have come from the medication at any point? Do I remember any symptoms which might have precipitated my mom’s seeking of medical help? Did I try to ignore these symptoms in an attempt to preserve my status of irresponsibility as a child? Did my mom need help that no one in my family could provide?

Work and Time
So often we choose the wrong objectives and we consequently engage in the process incorrectly because we mistake the role of our results and destinations of our journey in defining our life satisfaction. 

You should find work which is compelling and interesting for its own sake, and not specifically because of something you want to achieve from it years from now.

Why did I stop?
Why did I stop masturbating out of schedule? Why did I stop watching porn? It’s strange. It has to do with control. Abstaining from these things seems to give me in a control and stability in a world that promises neither and actively works against both.

Why Students Hate Math
Mathematics is cognitively difficult. It requires ordered and logical thinking. But to many students mathematics seems to be without purpose. Thus, they are required to learn and work through something which is difficult and purposeless, the latter quality enhancing the former. Because they see math as pointless, students devote less effort to it and hence they perform less well. However, most such students live in a culture which tells them they are stupid if they perform poorly in mathematics, and thus in addition to the purposeless they initially associated with math, these students learn to associate shame and inadequacy with it as well. 

The net effect is an anathema of math and possibly any thing which applies it (i.e. physics). 


Our View of the Past
People cannot help but view past events with an implicit sense of inevitability which was not at all present in the event at the moment it was experienced. This mischaracterization is significant because our present is our past in that the moment we attempt to conceptualize a present event, it is already added to our history. And so any sense of inevitability we ascribe to our past will be reflected, if only unconsciously, in how we live our current moments.
	Thus, an inability to recognize how our present continually creates our past and also the uncertainty inherent in the past due to its connection to the present makes people incapable of properly engaging with the present and properly appreciating the challenges of the past. 
	I am making an argument for agency and for agency’s continual relevance in a life. The victories of the past have never really been achieved because the battles are still being fought today. Do not let the crystallization of your present into your past confuse you concerning the nature of the present. The three nights (or however many weeks, months, years) ago when I stayed up to finish my research report, they are with me now, and at this moment I am still there at 1AM in the morning trying to decide whether to watch a TV-show, sleep for a while, or find some way to write something, anything. The decision does not exist back then, but exists now. The details are different and the situation may be wholly dissimilar, but the individual poised at the precipice of an uncertain future is the same.

From Making it Stick

“Dweck came to see that some students aim at performance goals, while others strive toward learning goals. In the first case, you’re working to validate your ability. In the second case, you’re working to acquire new knowledge or skills. People with performance goals unconsciously limit their potential. If your focus is on validating or showing off your ability, you pick challenges you are confident you can meet. You want to look smart, so you do the same stunt over and over again. but if your goal is to increase your ability, you pick ever-increasing challenges, and you interpret setbacks as useful information that helps you to sharpen your focus, get more creative and work harder.
…
Paradoxically, a focus on performance trips up some star athletes. Praised for being “naturals,” they believe their performance is a result of innate gifts. If they’re naturals, the idea goes, they shouldn’t have to work hard to excel, and in fact many simply avoid practicing, because a need to practice is public evidence that their natural gifts are not good enough to cut the mustard after all. A focus on performance instead of learning and growing causes people to hold back from risk taking or exposing their self-image to ridicule by putting themselves into situations where they have to break a sweat to deliver the critical outcome.”

When society is evaluating the accomplishments of an individual, the individual as he or she exists today is not taken with his or her personal history. There is no sense of where the individual began or what decisions of work and perseverance he made to become who he is. All the society can see is the individual as he exists today. In this sense society will always praise people in a language which attributes their success to something intrinsic to them, because any deeper narrative is difficult to distill at facevalue.

Any emptiness you feel is your being responding to gaps in the presentation of the world. There are many things which exist in the world and all these things are for some reason inadequate for you. There is a hole in your experiences, and since the hole is most intensely felt (as far as you know) by you, you are the one with the best likelihood of filling it.

I prepared the music for the party. We listened to P-square, Iyanya, and Will Smith. My friends danced in a circle, and they competed against each other. We hosted the party during the summer, on labor day. The temperature was between 70 and 80 degrees. I was very hot.

Holes and Footholds

We are not only looking for holes in the narrative, we are also looking for footholds up the mountain. That is we are not only looking for questions which have yet to be answered, but we are also looking for ways to extend or build upon the work as it exists now in such a way that these questions can be answered.

Laser Resurfacing 
Yesterday at 2pm I went through my first laser resurfacing treatment. I am not entirely sure if it was worth it. It was expensive, arguably more so than I can afford at a time when I should be saving money. In any case, what was it like? Very, very painful. Even though I arrived an hour early in order to use the so called numbing cream, I still clearly felt the laser. It was like someone was using a simultaneously, and oddly, cold and hot pen to draw on my skin. I imagine it’s similar to what a tattoo feels like. Throughout the entire procedure, I was straining to fight the pain and remain still at the same time. The doctor went over my face with the laser twice, and afterwards I told him I needed to take a break. After he went over my face a third time the procedure was over. But it seemed to have been so taxing that I was reduced to tears! When I sat up a stream of water left my eyes as though I had been crying. 

Before the procedure, one of the doctor’s assistants informed me that my face may be swollen for a day or two afterwards and that my skin would feel like sandpaper. This intrigued me, and she was of course right. My face was swollen immediately after the procedure but the swelling steadily reduced over the course of the day. But by the end of the day my face did feel much like a very fine sand paper. It was like an extreme version of how my skin feels after I wash it and fail to apply lotion afterwards. Moreover, the pores around my chin seemed to be producing this clear non-sebaceous substance. This contributed to the sandpaper feel of my skin. 

These after operation symptoms have not abated. I realize it’s really too soon to expect them to, but I can’t help but feel a slight fear that I have made a mistake. I had already rescheduled this appointment in the past and I was quite close to canceling the appointment yesterday. So I wasn’t exactly sold on going through with the procedure, but I did so anyway. You in the future know the outcome of it, whether this was a good or stupid thing to do. Be kind as you judge the person who forced you to live with the consequences. His vision was not as clear as yours is now. [//]

Sunburn City
Ahh! My face is flaking like crazy! Before the procedure, the assistant told me that a few days later it would be like I had a sun burn. When I told her I never had a sun burn before she chuckled. I wonder if she was laughing at my eventual fate or my previously fortunate history. I have also been informed (from a website on laser resurfacing) that I shouldn’t proactively try to peel the “burned” skin away because it may leave scarring. 
	I should also mention that I’m experiencing that hyperpigmentation I heard so much about and feared. It seems to be manifest as dark patches of skin I don’t know if it exists only on the level of the burned skin or goes deeper, but it looks quite bad at the moment. I’ve decided to work from home today in order to not frighten pedestrians and small children. 
[//]

11:39 PM
So all the dead skin has peeled away. Throughout the day my face became progressively itchier and flakier, and I could help absentmindedly peeling away at the flaky upper layer. Fortunately most of the skin underneath was healed. But goodness! It was crazy-making. My face felt so uncomfortable and scratchy that I couldn’t take my mind off the feeling. I watched videos and movies all day to distract myself from picking at it, but that didn’t really work. The saving grace was the shower I just took. It softened the peeling skin so I was able to kind of rub it off with my fingers. Now my face looks pretty much like I imagine it did Sunday morning. There are only a few small pink patches. 
	Currently, I’m wondering if I’m done with the post operation effects. Will my skin peel and flake again? Will I develop the actual hyperpigmentation I heard about (and not just the darkening of upper level dead skin)? I am also abstractly wondering if I want to experience a part II of this. This flaky skin episode was only manageable because Harvard was essentially closed for vacation. I would have lost my mind if I had gone to and stayed at work. Next month, I might not be so fortunate.

Writing a paper
Right now the work that I’ve done that (I think) is closest to a paper is the one-dimensional statistical mechanics model. What would I have to do if I want to turn it into a paper?
Two Figures: One of which can be a comparison between the theoretical predictions of the model and the stochastic simulation of the model.
Phase Transitions: Does the system exhibit phase transitions? First you would need to define an order parameter for this system. 
Partition Function: What is the partition function of the system?
Large N limit: Does the solution have a large N limit form?
Spin Glass Behavior: Could we analyze the system as a spin glass?
Universality: What is the universality class of the model?

References: I need to compile a list of references for this work. I can think of two books that may be relevant - Two and single dimensional models in statistical mechanics/ Exactly solvable models in statistical mechanics. I know one of these books is written by elliot lieb/the other I’m not so sure. 

Here are the books:
Mathematical Physics in One Dimension: Exactly Soluble Models of Interacting Particles by Elliot Lieb
Exactly Solved Models in Statistical Mechanics by Rodney Baxter

I also need a list of possible places I can publish the work. At the moment I think the Physical Review E, and the Journal of Statistical Physics (IOP) are potential places.

Pecan Pie
The guy is an applied mathematics post doc. The week before thanksgiving he was teaching a class. His girlfriend (who you cannot name Hannah because of Girls) needs to be introduced sooner. Maybe we can start with him making the pie. We need to flesh out Hannah*. Who is she? 

Talk about his attempt to buy a larger pie bowl and calculate the needed ingredients. 

You need to show the readers that he’s white. Hanah -> Helen. Make her Chinese. David is white. Sasha is also white. 

“imprecise popular science writers often tout this as an example manifestation of Einstein’s ideas on the relativity of time, but of course this is not so. Relativity claims that the fundamental passage of time is dependent on the nascent coordinate system. Such a passage of time is independent of the perception of the people who experience it. But the deceleration of time at the precipice of a catastrophe is all perception, and as such has nothing at all to do with relativity”.

“It’s purely psychological and I never took the time to figure out why it happens, but I have my own little theory…

 I like the ending but I think it can be improved. Is there some question which is left unanswered, at this point. Something that could be answered in a page or two?


James Baldwin
“All you are ever told in this country about being black is that it is a terrible, terrible thing to be. Now, in order to survive this, you have to dig down into yourself and re-create yourself, really, according to no image which yet exists in America. You have to impose, in fact—this may sound very strange—you have to decide who you are, and force the world to deal with you and not with its idea of you.”
— from Terkel Baldwin interview 1961

“One of the reasons, for example, I think that our youth is so badly educated—and it is inconceivably badly educated—is because education demands a certain daring, a certain independence of mind. You have to teach some people to think; and in order to teach some people to think, you have to teach them to think about everything. There mustn’t be something they can not think about. If there is one thing they can not think about, very shortly they can’t think about anything.”


Saturday November 28, 2015 2:32 PM

I was standing in the bakery aisle, blankly staring at cake mixes and frosting when Hannah called me. 

“How much longer will you be?” she growled.

“I’m choosing a pie tin,” I said. “I can’t find the 9in tin so I’m going—“

“For the love of god, Daniel. It doesn’t matter. Just choose one and get back here. I’m going to be late to Tiffany’s recital if we don’t start soon.”

I looked down at my phone just in time to see the profile picture of a smiling Hannah vanish and get replaced with my standard wallpaper. I tucked my phone into my back pocket and resumed my search for the pie tin.

 The recipe I knew called for a 9in tin, but all I saw were 12in ones. I needed half a dozen ingredients for the pie, and I assumed the quantity of each scaled proportionally to the volume of the tin. How much more of each ingredient would I need given that I would use a tin with a 12in diameter instead of a 9in one? This is a simple proportionality problem, assuming you knew the formula for the volume of a tin (which is essentially a trapezoidal wedge) in terms of its radius. But if you didn’t know it, or didn’t remember it (like I didn’t), then the simple proportionality problem became an intermediate calculus problem.  The difficulty of such problems always seemed to subtly depend on the knowledge brought to bear upon them. Someone sufficiently skilled would be able to get by regardless of his nascent knowledge, but if his knowledge was sufficiently robust a 30 minute calculation could be avoided in lieu of a five minute one. 

I picked up the 12 in pie tin and the large pack of pecans that were in the same aisle. I also needed to buy egg, flour, and an improbably large amount of sugar. 

I had eaten pecan pie for almost a decade before I ever thought to inquire what it was made of. The pecans and the flour, egg, and milk that make up the crust are obvious ingredients, but what of the filling? Besides butter and some vanilla extract, when you dig into the custard what you’re consuming is 55% (Check This) brown and white sugar. It’s like if instead of eating a slice of pie, you were to combine 1 of a cup of pecans and a cup of sugar and then ladled the granular mixture onto your tongue. Of course this is not entirely surprising given the taste of pecan pie, but I had always thought pecan pie was on the same level of “bad for you” ness as cake and cookies. When really what I had been eating all those years were small slices of an especially dangerous diabetic time bomb.

What’s holding you back is your ego. It is impossible to do everything, and it is further still impossible to do everything perfectly, yet you continue to believe you can and have to do so.

You could be a very good physicist, if you only stopped trying to be the best one.
——-

My mother showed me the recipe for pecan pie during my winter break in my last year of college, and afterwards I vowed I would never eat it again. But it’s the only pie I have a homemade recipe for, and it reminds me of my prior life in New Orleans. So when Hannah told me we had to go to Sasha’s for Thanksgiving dinner, and that we had to bring a desert, there was little question what I would bring.

It was like every day of your life you walked across a bridge, and across that bridge you carried bowling balls and drove tanks and oil trucks, and the bridge didn’t sway or tilt. And then one day you walked across the bridge bouncing a small rubber ball and when you were halfway across, the bridge all of sudden shuddered and collapsed. 

Intuitively, such a scenario seems strange and unlikely. But mathematics exist primarily because intuition is unreliable. Classical mechanics tells us that supposedly robust systems can be susceptible to structural weaknesses when they’re vibrated at just the right frequency.  Essentially, you could shake a building down, left and right and it won’t move, unless you manage to shake it “just right” at which point it’ll topple over with little force. 

These “just right” frequencies can be calculated assuming you have the foresight and knowledge to do so, or they could be experienced by happenstance. The former is preferred, but due to the exigencies of human laziness and myopia, the latter is more likely, often to disastrous effect. Just ask the denizens of Tacoma circa 1940, (assuming the younger ones at the time are still alive).

Meeting a new person is like opening a book for the first time. That first meeting is somewhat awkward and forced as you try to understand what this person is about. You don't pay attention to the language and larger context of things which will seem so significant later on because these things have not yet revealed a consistency which would separate them from the millions of other things you see in that first meeting. The first meeting is always superficial. A small spritz of water compared to the relational inundation which may come in the future. But in that fist meeting lies a hint of all that you will experience later.

————

Behind me I heard the words "Hello," They were said softly as though from a friend. I turned around and looked at the woman who had just spoken and as my eyes locked onto hers she reacted as though she had been lightly slapped on the cheek for her head jerked back and her eyes grew wider. This woman did not know me, but she had thought she did. When she saw my face, she let out a “No….” The word was slightly dragged out as though she was trying to fend off a stranger who stopped her on the street and asked for change. She averted her eyes from me and bowing her head, walked quickly away.
 My eyes followed her until she turned a corner a the end of the aisle and disappeared into some other part of the store. I checked my watch, it had been half an hour since Hannah called me. I was already late.

  How difficult would it be to calculate the new proportions of the ingredients given that  

The call ended with the phone still touching my ear. 

I learned the recipe for pecan pie during my last year of college, but I didn’t make it then and I also vowed to never eat it again. I stopped fantasizing about it each year before the winter vacation, and I stopped eating it whenever my mom made it for me back home. But it’s the only pie I have a homemade recipe for, and it reminds me of my prior life in New Orleans. So when Hannah told me we had to go to Sasha’s for a thanksgiving dinner and we had to bring a desert, there was little question what I would bring.

I didn't like Jamal when I first met him. No one did. I even imagine when the final roster of pledges was decided and all of the new recruits gathered into the meeting room, more than half of the brothers were probably asking "How did #7 get here?" He was this scrawny mixed kid with glasses, an annoying voice, and a personality which invited insult. You just knew he was the last kid picked for dodge ball every time in high school. I tried my best to distance myself from him that first semester of college, but we were in the same pledge class, and, with solidarity as one of the tenets of our fraternity, we had to do everything together. During one weekend when our pledge class was eating pizza while deciding how to transport an engineless car from the library parking lot to the football field, he unnecessarily confessed something. Unnecessarily because it was both unprompted and already known.

Say Something 
I used to believe that there was a clear difference between speaking just to say something, and speaking because one has something to say. The first connotes a sort of frivolity of motives, a desire to act based on a dislike of silence or simply an insecurity in the presence of it. The second is the only action of substance because it is done with deliberation, with a prior review of how what will be said affects those hearing it and what relevance it has to any previous discussion. I always thought I should strive for the latter and categorically avoid the former. 

Bull shit. Such a description is an idealistic model of engaging with the world and as such leaves gaps in how reality actually unfolds. Instead, in all my experience of speaking in class, coming up with physics problems, or writing, I find that you can’t ever really find out if you have something to say unless you say something. This isn’t to imply that one speaks thoughtlessly, but rather that the prior evaluation of the value of an idea is not always accurate and an overly developed self censor would lead just as often to the denial of good ideas as to the filtering away of bad ones. Such a recognition is an admission of ignorance. It is you saying to yourself that your idea may be boring, obvious, and shallow but it may also be strange and perceptive, and until you release this idea out into the world you will never truly know what it is.

Quantum Field Theory As Formalism
How many times am I going to write about quantum field theory instead of actually trying to solve original problems in it? I guess until I feel comfortable enough with a general understanding of it, to devise an interesting and soluble problem. 

I think for a long time the larger issue was that I was trying to deal with quantum field theory somewhat abstractly. Namely, I was trying to generate a problem from “thin air” simply from the material in the introductory textbooks. I have now (albeit belatedly) concluded how limiting and silly of an approach this is. I previously related quantum field theory to calculus, claiming that it was really a mathematical theory which was applicable to fields much wider than the subject arena which led to its development. But I never internalized the corollary lesson that calculus (and generally analysis) did not develop by continually trying to plumb mechanics of it’s theoretical depths, but through attempts to apply calculus to phenomena quite different from mechanics. It was the extensions to fluid system, thermodynamics, and electricity and magnetism which helped bring upon differential equations and vector calculus. 

And so, if I am to simultaneously obtain a deeper understanding of quantum field theory and generate problems associated with it, I will have to leave the exclusive space of particle theoretic systems and attempt to apply quantum field theory to physically novel systems.

Partition Function of Permutation model
I recently calculated the general partition function of the N-permutation model I studied last April. Back then I didn’t even compute the partition function; I just computed the probability for the first element to be “correct”. But last week, I started by computing the partition function for the 5-permutation model, and afterwards I tried to make good on my promise to devise a combinatorial argument for the analysis. It took some time but I eventually derived a recursive albeit non-linear formula for the coefficients of the Boltzmann expansion. 

I’m going to use this calculation as a basic model for a research paper. I think I’ve written many work notes in the past, but nothing I’ve done has “felt” publishable partly because I wasn’t working within a research context, and also because I didn’t sufficiently flesh out my results. In any case this process, has allowed me to abstract some lessons for future work.

Stick very close to the mathematics: Actionable insight comes from recognizing the potential in a mathematical approach. And the concreteness of your work comes from specifically dealing with the mathematics. All of the progress I made with this calculation—and really with most of my toy projects—came from working out the mathematics which I could understand and only then pushing it in a new direction. 

When I want to think of a new project in a subject I would consider the general properties of the subject and try to relate that to the general properties in another subject. I did this when I was thinking about percolation theory. The problem is that the external perspective of a work is inaccurate and not actionable, namely you can’t really move it forward. You have to be intimately engaged with the subject in order to push it in a profitable direction. 

Work out specifically and mathematically some analysis fundamental to what you’re learning using your own explanations. Wait a few hours or a day, and then try to push it in a new direction. 

“What if” questions are your friend: I guess I have Randall Munroe to thank for this. In terms of extending and generalizing a project, asking “What if” is the best way to generate actionable questions. These “what if” statements don’t even really have to be revolutionary, or particularly insightful. They are just a good way to fill out the conceptual and mathematical background of a question. 

This is also a good way to work through a paper. If you begin with a paper you think is interesting, you can ask “what if” questions to try to extend an approach within it. 

Kernel and Flesh: positively gruesome title. This is partly related to the above point, and something I wrote a year ago after the relativistic rocket or precession project. To start an investigation you really only need a kernel of a new idea. By establishing this kernel of an idea (mathematically of course; see two points above), you can add substance to it by asking extension questions about it. Through such a process the kernel of the idea becomes a full on and worthy investigation.

Moving to Saybrook
They’re is something which feels so hopeless and lonely about completely hating an environment that so many others blithely accept. By moving 2 and a half miles away from Harvard, I was fortunate to leave such an environment and thereby obtain a better understanding of my reaction to it. Over time, I learned that there is perhaps no pride in failing to fit comfortably into your surroundings, but there also need not be any shame.

Existentially Dangerous

JAMES: I don’t know how she’s going to deal with it. 

DIEGO: She’ll find a way. And if she can’t it doesn’t matter. The world will go on, regardless, of what happens between us. 

JAMES: That attitude, that way you intellectually distance yourself from these events. You’re just trying to avoid pain. 

DIEGO: If I’m at all distant it’s not because I’m flinching in anticipation of pain, but because I recognize pain’s inevitability. Anything which is such a constant of the world can’t be that existentially dangerous.

Pigeons Fighting
Ade looked up from the equations scattered across his page and out the window to the street below. A half a dozen pigeons had congregated around a slice of bread and were alternately pecking at it and each other. Suddenly a truck came down the road, and the birds scattered to the air and surrounding trees. After the truck had passed a lone bird swooped back down to the road. It pecked and held on to one corner of the bread, and tried to fly away with the entire slice, but the bread was too heavy. The bird had moved only a foot from its original position before it was on the ground once more, and by then the other birds had returned to fight for their piece as well. [//]

Getting The Work Done

From “The Potential Theory of Adsorption” by Michael Polanyi
“The first point to mention is the fact that I would never have conceived my theory, let alone have made a great effort to verify it, if I had been more familiar with major developments in physics that were taking place.
…
My verification could make no impression on minds convinced that it was bound to be specious. Since electrical forces could not produce an adsorption potential of the kind I was postulating, and since no principle was conceivable at the time which could account for such an adsorption potential, Langmuir’s claims supporting the then current view of matter were firmly accepted, though they were false (or irrelevant to adsorption on solid surfaces), and my evidence was rejected unexamined, though it was valid.”


Making It Stick: Questions to ask when reading a text
What are the key ideas?

What terms or ideas are new to me?

How would I define them?

How do the ideas relate to what I already know?


Radiation, Collisions, Oscillations
A point particle collides with a hollowed out sphere. The sphere has a point mass attached to two springs at its center. This point mass a charge of radius q. Say that the external point particle collides with the hollowed out sphere. And say that the hollow sphere is a perfectly absorbing material with a specific heat capacity. How fast does the external point particle have to be going, in order for the hollow sphere to reach it’s melting point (due to the electromagnetic radiation of the point charge?)


Assume there are $N$ point masses uniformly distributed across a finite length $L$. These point masses are in thermal equilibrium at an initial temperature $T_0$. Then the external surroundings are bumped up and held at a temperature $T>T_0$. 

What is the average amount of time for all these particles to be at a higher temperature?
Compute $N(t)$ where $N$ is the average number of particles at the lower temperature.

\notee{I read a paper recently which analyzed the time dependent dynamics of the hard rod gaseous system. It did so not through the master equation, but through a sort of common sense accounting of how the particle velocities should evolve. This made me realize there are less formal ways to study the dynamics of gaseous systems and they should be pursued if possible.}

The Blundering Physicist
About a month ago I found a way to study inelastic scattering in an oscillator system. My main goal was to obtain a better understanding of how a mechanical system with clearly defined internal parts could undergo inelastic scattering. The system I chose was pretty simple: it consisted of a point particle and a hollow sphere. Inside the sphere, and along its collision axis there was a point mass with springs attached on opposite ends connected to the walls of the sphere. The basic physical idea was that the external point particle could collide with the hollow sphere and the vibrating degree of freedom within the sphere would absorb some of the energy thus making it appear that the external system has lost some energy. 

I will not say the problem was easy to solve. It required some thought transforming it into something amenable to a clean solution (i.e. moving from the mass inside the sphere to a simple coupled oscillator system), and I had to convince myself of a physical insight on which the solution hinged, but in all it was rewarding. I now have an example of an inelastic collision derived from a subsystem ubiquitous to mechanics. 

I got the problem from an assignment from Alex’s (Rodriguez) 2009 Physics III lecture notes. When I first saw the problem I was immediately fascinated by it, but I never took the time to work out a solution. But when I started to do so, I resolved not to look at Alex’s solution for fear of denying myself the joy of working it out myself. After I obtained my solution, I looked through Alex’s, and to my surprise they were completely different. Besides answering a different question, Alex used a physical assumption (one which I don’t think is entirely correct) to simplify the mathematics of his analysis. His solution was written in half a page, while mine took almost two. In any case, I much valued the insight I obtained from my solution to the problem, an insight I might never had obtained had I first read through Alex’s work and assumed the problem already solved. I originally thought I was being egocentric by wanting to solve the problem on my own, but now I realize there is great value in doing so. 

The primary value is in having to develop your own insights into the problem. These insights are valuable primarily because if they are indeed idiosyncratic, then no one else besides you can develop them. This relates to the secondary value: a multifaceted view of the problem. If you solve the problem in a way that’s original, you’ll be able to combine your analysis with the analysis found in the literature to obtain a more holistic understanding of the problem. 

In Make It Stick the authors state that students in general learn more about a problem, if they are forced to struggle through it before they are given the solution (In my case I seem to learn less seeing as after I have successfully struggled through a problem, I then ignore the standard solution!). Moreover the authors talk about a writer who taught herself gardening by “blundering” through the process. Here’s her rationale for her moniker, “The Blundering Gardener”:

“Blundering means that you get going on your project before you have figured out how to do it in the proper way, before you know what you’re getting into. For me, the risk of knowing what you’re getting into is that it becomes an overwhelming obstacle to getting started.”

By working through gardening problems on her own she eventually developed unique solutions to problems that those in the gardening field had wrestled with for years. 

Bonnie said that the farmers that she had recently met were particularly interested in what she has learned about the advantages of composting and earthworms over chemical fertilizers for building nutrients…She paused in recounting her meeting with them, reflecting on how all this knowledge sneaked up on her. It was never something she set out to conquer. ‘Look, blundering’s really not a bad thing. It’s a good thing in that you get stuff done. A lot of people, when they contemplate the enormity of the task and they see all that’s entailed, they’re stopped in their tracks.’
(Brown et.al., Make It Stick)

So besides giving you the opportunity to solve problems in potentially new ways, blundering about supposedly established arenas of work allow you to get started in work which you may have doubted your ability to complete had you started more formally. It can also protect you from perspectives on the work which are incorrect. When Michael Polanyi developed his theory of Adsorption, he avoided getting tangled in the then current (but wrong) theories by being somewhat ignorant of the literature

The first point to mention is the fact that I would never have conceived my theory, let alone have made a great effort to verify it, if I had been more familiar with major developments in physics that were taking place.
…
My verification could make no impression on minds convinced that it was bound to be specious. Since electrical forces could not produce an adsorption potential of the kind I was postulating, and since no principle was conceivable at the time which could account for such an adsorption potential, Langmuir’s claims supporting the then current view of matter were firmly accepted, though they were false (or irrelevant to adsorption on solid surfaces), and my evidence was rejected unexamined, though it was valid. (Polanyi, Knowing and Being)

We find this also in Feynman’s stories of his approach to QED. Apparently, being confused (and unconvinced) by the existing theories of quantum fields, Feynman tried to develop his own understanding of the the quantum properties of electrodynamics. 

This I gathered from books like those of Heitler and Dirac. I was inspired by the remarks in these books; not by the parts in which everything was proved and demonstrated carefully and calculated, because I couldn't understand those very well. At that young age what I could understand were the remarks about the fact that this doesn't make any sense, and the last sentence of the book of Dirac I can still remember, "It seems that some essentially new physical ideas are here needed." So, I had this as a challenge and an inspiration. I also had a personal feeling, that since they didn't get a satisfactory answer to the problem I wanted to solve, I don't have to pay a lot of attention to what they did do.
(Feynman, Physics Nobel Lecture)

In all we see there seems always to be value in attempting to solve a problem on one’s own. But I recognize there is another side to this advice. My work attempting to study gravity through Sakharov’s Induced gravity picture has revealed that sometimes one’s individual approach really isn’t the best one. Attempting to reproduce Einsteinian gravity through quantum loop amplitudes seems prohibitively messy as of now, so I’m turning to other things temporarily. But consistent with the general advice of this article, I am glad I attempted to do so first seeing as now I have a clearer sense of which approaches do and do not work. 

But perhaps even as a more extensive caveat, precise and reliable technical sophistication, the kind which can only be built up by working patiently through a set of material, is often a pre-requisite to an unambiguous solution to a problem . I learned this when I was working on the Reasoning Mind and CS209 data science projects. When you’re attempting to answer a new question, a question which does not have a clear algorithmic approach or a clear set of associated techniques, you’re working in very vague territory. Whatever work you complete you will not be absolutely sure that your solution is the best solution to the problem. Thus, although you can’t be sure that the collection of premises and assumptions which constrain your solution are correct you should be sure that the logical statements derived from them are correct, and this can only be achieved if you have some technical sophistication in the related problem area. 

Therefore there is a balancing act taking place. If you try to build up too much formality initially you might become intimidated and stymied by technical details, but if you learn no formality you’ll never be able to do anything creative in the new field. 

There are two ways to approach this balancing act: one I discovered some time ago, and another I discovered recently. The first concerns gateway problems. These are problems or projects that can conveniently frame one’s first foray into a new technical field. They are chosen so that they extend your current knowledge without requiring you to learn too much formal aspects off the bat. In this way they provide a gateway into the relevant field. Such type of work seems to be what the blundering gardener is describing when she suggests getting started right away in a new field of study. 

The second approach concerns reading textbooks. As a committed habit from my previous episodes of self study, whenever I tried to learn a new subject I would begin at the start of the book and try to work completely through the text. For some reason, I stopped being able to do this a few years ago, and so I effectively stopped learning new things. It was only recently that I developed a guerrilla approach to learning new topics. It’s quite easy for me to assemble the focus required to write 3-7 pages of notes, so this is my limit on material I write up and I use this limit to develop learning modules. I choose a moderately specific topic that I want to learn (like “The Master Equation and Kangarooo Processes” or “Complex Analysis”), and after collecting references relevant to the topic I try to distill it into essential or interesting components and I only write up those components. So far it’s worked for Complex Analysis, a subject that I’ve been trying and failing to learn for years, so I hope it will continue working. 
 

Takeaways

- Personal Perspective: You develop a different (perhaps more useful) understanding of the problem than if you just read the solution first. You may also learn something about the problem that other people have not yet learned. 

- Against Formality: Aside from trying to solve a problem using your own knowledge, when entering a field of work don’t feel that you need to move through it formally. To get started you can see yourself as a renegade, making progress in the areas you can and initially ignoring everything else.

- Don’t hold fast to the rule uncritically. Evaluate your solution for difficulty and tenability, before you claim that it is really better than the standard one. [//]

Mention the Caveat about Technical Sophistication?

The other side of this argument is the recognition that technical sophistication is often a pre-requisite for the accurate depiction and ultimate solution of a problem. In developing 

Mention Gateway problem? That’s essentially what the blundering gardener seems to be describing. 

Renegade Approach to Learning: Instead of trying to work steadily through a textbook, I’m selecting specific topics I’d like to learn and writing notes on them. This is is haphazard (sort of) but it’s helpful because I am no longer forcing myself to get through the seemingly impossible task of slogging through boring work, and I am instead quickly zooming in to the new material. 


Antidepressants and Laser Surgery 4:10 AM
I have been on antidepressants for a month and a half now. I have certainly noticed the effects. For one, I can once again recognize the beauty in physics. And the effect feels so profound and so inevitable that I wonder how I could have ever lost sight of it. But of course this vision is not really a choice, so I can imagine how something inside me could have been biochemically deficient so that although I was looking at the work of physics, I could not see it the way I do now, because I lacked the physiological ability to feel and respond to it. 

More generally I am feeling the consequences of the antidepressants in two directions. One, I have much more energy throughout the day. It’s like I’m drinking coffee again, except there are no hyper-alert and hyper-jittery after effects. Two, I care less about what people think. This second point is evidenced by the fact that I can study in the G2 offices now with only mild discomfort, and more telling, I told my sister and my housemates that I’ve liked guys in the past. Even more telling I used my own face (and everything!) for a profile picture for a gay dating application. So, in comparison to my former self I am somewhat footloose. 

The fear of course is that the antidepressants may become less effective or I could loose access to my supply, either event which would plunge me back to the darkness from where I came and possibly even deeper now that I have stood for some time in the light. 

But for now, I am allowing myself to luxuriate in that quality pre-requisite for negotiating the human condition: Hope.

By the by, I am experiencing the real hyperpigmentation symptoms from my laser surgery. I first noticed them on Dec 5, about two weeks after my laser surgery. They seemingly manifested as lighter circles around my eyes, but were of course the actual darkening of  all parts of my face besides my eyelids (which were covered by glasses during the procedure). Dr. Avram and he told me the pigmentation would fade in a few weeks. 

Shouldn’t I make a self effacing comment about vanity and my shameless attachment to it? I’m superficial and narcissistic. Just like so many people on this earth. But this isn’t my defense, it’s a damnation. I liked to believe I was different, deeper, and more real, and here I am acting just like everyone else: Spending money to change myself so that the world could love me more, and, I hope, for some of that love to trickle into a self-appreciation I could carry with me when I’m alone. Has it worked? No, not yet. Will you try it again? I don’t know.

James Baldwin
His writing is amazing. Never since Ayn Rand had I experienced a writer whose prose was so evocative and powerful. Moreover, his writing, although, beautiful is always (correction: usually) connected to a wider social context which further justifies it. So I have learned two lessons from Baldwin

There is real power in good writing: being surrounded by somewhat mediocre writing, I think I’ve been lulled into the belief that how one says something on paper is not incredibly important. But Baldwin’s example reveals how potent language can be if one chooses words carefully and thinks about syntax. I already try to do this in my fiction writing, but can these lessons also be incorporated into my scientific writing?

The value of a larger context: I am vindicated in my enjoyment of Baldwin’s writing because although it is good, it is not merely good; it is also very relevant. Meaning his writing (with the possible exception of his movie reviews) is always contending with a social question in America. The social question he deals with is often about race, and he always seems able to connect the smallest story or analysis to this social question. This is something I can’t always achieve in my writing, but now that I know it’s possible I can work harder to achieve it. 

I’ll end with a quote by Baldwin that I might have identified too much with in the past, but which I can now appreciate as true and comical:

Any writer, I suppose, feels that the world into which he was born is nothing less than a conspiracy against the cultivation of his talent—which attitude certainly has a great deal to support it. On the other hand, it is only because the world looks on his talent with such a frightened indifference that the artist is compelled to make his talent important.

From The Mathematician’s Brain

“It may be hard to believe that a mathematician of Grothendieck’s caliber could not find an adequate academic position in France after he left the IHES. I am convinced that if Grothendieck had been a former student of the Ecole Normale and if he had been part of the system, a position commensurate with his mathematical achievements would have been found for him. Let me digress on this a minute. When Pierr-Gilles de Gennes got his physics Nobel Prize in 1991, there was an official ceremony in his honor at the Sorbonne, with speeches by de Gennes himself… On this occasion de Gennes branded corporatism as the plague of French science. Certainly this applies to physics, and even more to mathematics. What this means is that it is all important whether you are from the Ecole Normale or the Ecole Polytechnique, in whose lab you were accepted, whether you are at the CNRS, the academy, a suitable political party, and so on. If you are in one of these groups, they will help you and you have to help them. In the case of Grothendieck, he was nothing (not even having at the time French or any citizenship). He was nobody’s responsibility; he was just an embarassment. 
	Understandably, some people would like to blame Grothendieck’s exclusion entirely on Grothendieck himself: he went crazy and left mathematics. But this does not fit with the known facts and their chronology. Something shameful has taken place. And the disposal of Grothendieck will remain a disgrace in the history of twentieth-century mathematics.”

Changes in My Work Schedule
I’ve been doing more work recently, the antecedents of which were a change in what I did with my time. I shouldn’t romanticize this too much; I mostly did what I felt compelled to do, what “felt most real to me”, and I naturally had less time for everything else. But the change is real, and I recognize how the change has led to a cleaner thought pattern, and one which is more amenable to thinking about and solving problems. 

How has my schedule changed?
I’ve listened to fewer podcasts
I read fewer articles in the atlantic

Instead I’ve been reading novels, non fiction works (mostly books by Baldwin and on soft aspects of science/mathematics), and watching anime (Gurren Lagnan and No.6). In the time between I’ve been thinking about ways to extend and stretch my current work in physics.

(re)Conceptualizing Success
Recognize that the world cannot take from you anything which is truly your own. The world can and often will try to make you forget that such things as self regard and independence are your due (so in your ignorance, you can easily be directed towards things which make you into a tool), but these things always belong to you even if they are lost and must be found again. In the same way, you cannot forever hold on to the things the world gives to you for such things are truly not of you. You can appreciate them while they are here, but this sense that they are fundamental to your constitution is false. And so if you live your life and you come to the end of it without all the awards and the accolades which supposedly define the life of value, recognize that this value has more to do with how other people (those giving the awards, accepting them, or merely on the sidelines talking about them) conceptualize their own life, and not with how you should conceptualize your own. 
	This is not me making an excuse for my failure in premature anticipation of it. This is really an acknowledgment that the claim of failure (even if only implicit through the silence of an unremarked upon life) details a misunderstanding of the conditions which define what we call “success” and thereby signifies a misunderstanding of what this “success” means for the life of a human being.  
[//]


All of the problems I solved exist as a potential kernel for a larger problem. Simply because I don’t explicitly see that larger problem at the moment doesn’t mean I shouldn’t engage with the possibility it represents in the now. 
When you look at these papers what you see is something produced out of a vacuum because you don’t recognize the context in which it was created. What you should instead recognize is there (even though you do not see it) is an attempt to create order out of a chaos. An attempt to organize and structure something which is clearly substantial, but was initially confusing and thus ill-defined. Thus when you are doing this work, you are not attempting to fill a similar vacuum, but rather to create order from the chaos. 


A Delineation of the Why

It is important to understand why you do something because you are inevitably going to be (or currently are) part of systems and institutions which will not only define objectives for your life but will also silently suggest why those objectives are valuable. And in such situations you have to decide whether you agree with the system’s “why”s and can identify with them. But in some sense, the decision has already been made simply by who you are. The actual decision is in what to do with the knowledge when you find there is a genuine conflict between who you are and who the communities of which you are a part tell you to be. It’s a decision of whether to hide this knowledge from yourself and spend your life ignoring references to it, completely succumbing to the message implicit in the knowledge and subsequently condemning yourself to the periphery, or trying to understand and contextualize the knowledge and thereby make it actionable in your life. Regardless, our nascent motivations are always present and always affecting us, whether or not we choose to engage with them.

For the past few weeks I’ve been experiencing a sort of revitalization. I have been solving problems in physics and mathematics and simply enjoying the act of doing so. I do have plans to try to publish some of this work (because I have now acknowledged that I want to do so), but this desire no longer feels like an insurmountable weight which paradoxically makes it difficult to work. Undoubtedly, these feelings are due partly to the antidepressants and the more free time I have since ending my Yoruba class. But I like to also believe they come from a recognition of what is real and true in the world and from coming to terms with the things I had been using as a replacement for that truth.

What exactly is ‘real and true’? I still do not know, but I am quite sure of what feels real and true. 

Years ago I wrote that people’s mode of living represents on average their belief in the best that life can offer. No one preemptively strives to live a life without meaning, which is unfortunate because so many find that they are. But even if the life appears meaningless in retrospect, recognize that it still represented the deepest meaning they felt was possible to derive from it.

At the moment the thing that feels most real to me is the process of existing on the precipice of a knowledge and understanding that I can develop simply by moving symbols on the paper. My daily work in physics and mathematics is what feels real, the work not found in textbooks or lecture notes or research papers, but the work which only exists tomorrow because I acted today.

And it is not that all other experiences have no value. So much of what I do each day—watching movies, reading books, speaking with people—is absolutely necessary, not only because it serves as a respite between my so called work, but also because as an aspect of the “rest of the world” it provides a context and background to that work which justifies its importance. Moreover, every so often I will have an experience in this world which is as inspiring and engaging as anything I’ve done in physics. But it remains to be said that if I could only live in this world, devoid of a daily and personal engagement with physics and mathematics, it would feel like a surface level existence, a life lived in the sun and waves in avoidance of the fauna and flora residing in the deep.

This definition of the real is possibly a narcissistic perspective on life, to place so much value of your own actions outside of how those actions can affect others. But from another perspective it is the only tenable mode of living because it places value in things that have belonged and always will belong to you. The thing that belongs to us is the opportunity to appreciate the world. The chance to talk and engage with people and reality in the background of the potential meaninglessness of that engagement. Nothing beyond this is guaranteed, and we should not lie to ourselves and thereby rob ourselves of a beauty which is there and ready for appreciation by believing we can hold forever onto things which were never really our due.

Working towards what’s real to you. 
Watching Television; Reading Books; Riding The Bus:. 

For the past two weeks my working habits have been starkly different from what they had been in the past. Instead of reading articles in the New Yorker, and Atlantic, binge watching drama television shows, and procrastinating, I’ve been thinking and working on physics. 

Because mathematics is indeed beautiful. It’s beautiful for the basic fact that it apparently has nothing to do with human beings, and yet humans seem uniquely capable of developing and appreciating it. And less self referentially, it is beautiful for the structure and logic it possesses and the implication that any universe in which such things exist, although not manifestly full of meaning, cannot be arbitrary.

And so for me mathematics is a way of truly seeing the world. I don’t mean this in the way that people sometimes describe it as a perspective and a language through which the world can be described. Rather it acts as a torch in an abandoned city, revealing dark passages and forgotten mansions which have always existed around us but which would have remained hidden without the illumination of clean logic. 

It’s beautiful for the fact that it has nothing to do with us. It’s beautiful for the fact that humans are capable of developing engaging it and appreciating it. And it is beautiful for itself for the structure and logic it possesses, the fact that it is part of our universe, and the implication that said universe, although not clearly manifestly full of meaning, is not arbitrary.

It is in this way that mathematics allows me to renew my faith in living. Engaging with problems, logically and cleanly working out answers to questions I could not answer days, weeks, or years earlier is a simple activity which continually shows me that the world is full of hidden things worthy of appreciation, even if I cannot see them now. And as such, doing mathematics and physics in this way and for these reasons continually allows me to see the world again, and when I am cutoff from this perspective I loose that faith and my view of the world and myself (because, no matter how much I deny it, I am of the world) darkens. 

I know not everyone has this perspective. Not everyone needs such a niche and stereotypically academic hobby to restore their faith in the world. And so I must admit I am different in this specific sense—a difference I will have to come to terms with in time. But I do not believe I am different in general for ultimately what I am bolstering and developing is a spirituality which exists as the foundation of any religion. 

And recognizing my atheistic leanings, you might intuit something blasphemous in this claim. How can one who does not maintain belief in any particular theism, claim to be religious? But like most apparent contradictions the inconsistency exists not in the answer to the question but in the assumptions which frame the question itself. For what is religion other than a system of beliefs which allow us to make sense of, have faith in, and thus comfortably live within a world we cannot completely understand? 

What is a religion? Self servingly, I will give a definition which is consistent with the view I adopt for physics. Religion is a system of beliefs which allows us to make sense of, have faith in, (and thus comfortably live within) a world we cannot completely understand. It is also a way we can make sense of our roles in the universe and thus serves as the background to which we live our lives.

When I was at MIT, each year my fraternity conducted a forum called “Senior Speeches” where each person in the graduating class stood at a podium for an hour or more recounting lessons he learned from MIT and our fraternity. During his senior speech Kwami Williams tried to explain his perspective on his Christianity. He said that people try to fill their lives with alcohol, women, friends, diversions, and every vice and virtue known to man because they are trying to fill a space that only a faith in God could occupy. When I spoke to him later I told him I agreed with him that people were trying to fill some emptiness inside themselves, and before I could serve my caveat he anticipated it. “But you think they should be filling it with something other than religious faith.”  he said, without derision or attack. “Yes”, I had to admit. Kwami did not attempt to argue against this opinion, and instead accepted it as valid to me, thus demonstrating that he was one of the few people who could maintain a religious faith without disparaging the apparent lack of faith in others.

But there is often an inaccurate way those with the more formalized religions look upon people who claim no denomination. Christians seem to see others who have no religion as a sort of reflection of who they themselves might be without their specific faith. Within their own lives, so much of how they understand themselves and their history has its foundations in their Christian faith, that they envision if this faith were not present, a vast hole would open inside of themselves. And they are perhaps saying something true of their own lives, but when this argument is used to conceptualize the lives of the atheists or agnostics around them they are mistaken. 

Because while the hole may exist in all of us, what we choose to fill it with is always quite personal. And although we live lives surrounded by people whose sustenance is derived from sources completely antithetical to our own, there is no real hierarchy to this difference across people. An individual must live and structure his life according to the things which supply him with deeper meaning, and he must recognize the things he ultimately rests his life upon are functions of his own experiences (some deliberately chosen, other passively tolerated) and consequently cannot be carelessly applied to others. But while one cannot claim a ranking of values held by two different people, one can surely claim such a ranking in the life of an individual. 

Years ago I wrote that a person’s mode of living—the activities to which they devote their time and energy—represents their belief in the best that life can offer. No one preemptively strives to live a life without meaning, which is unfortunate because so many find that they are doing exactly that. In my own life, I always found a void opening up inside me whenever I drifted away from my own motivations. Whenever I worked to fit my aspirations into the narratives supplied by other people or institutions I was part of, even if not initially, I soon came to feel like I was a puppet spastically moving to the tugs and pulls of some foreign agent.

When I was much younger, I took pride in being a good student. And as a good student I had learned to reflexively subdue internal dissatisfaction to obtain the approval of figures of authority both real and imagined. Finding my childhood friendships flaky and unreliable and growing up in a family which placed possibly undue value on the merits of an education, I sought what I could not find from my peers—warmth and  fellowship— from teachers, principals, and school counselors. I spent countless hours studying for standardized tests because I believed the numerical score could reveal something significant about my life’s potential. I took difficult subjects in classes I didn’t care about to evince a personal value I could not feel. I applied to the most prestigious colleges simply because they were prestigious.

I had spent so long dependent on the love, communal acceptance, and recognition garnered from past accomplishments that I no longer could imagine what life would be without them. And in the space of this uncertainty, I became greedy. No recognition was ever enough if it existed concurrently with a denial of that recognition. And by the simple fact that the places we live in are so large and chock full of anonymous strangers, there are always such denials, there are always people who cannot recognize us simply because they do not know us. So I saw my future and my satisfaction in living it, fatally anchored to a success I believed I needed.

As I left high school and entered college, I soon replaced the teachers and principals of my youth with something more dangerous for it was less tangible: a distant and abstracted vision of a populace who would also only give me love if I proved myself worthy of it. 

In short, I lived (and I would not delude myself by thinking I completely no longer do) by what Leonard Mlodinow calls the “external perception of life”. It is living with a desire to dazzle and impress. Living for other people, not altruistically or even as a partnership, but as a parasite. I tried to live and make my home in the minds of others all because I was unable to contend with the doubt languishing in my own. And yet after all this, all these measures of tacit self denial proved to be, as they always eventually do, inadequate substitutes for the self recognition which was the only panacea to my insecurity. Self recognition, seeing yourself, not simply as the caricature the culture paints you as, not simply as a son or a brother, not simply as your history, but something which periodically conflates all these things only to negate them moments later in pursuit of a version of self never before seen. 

Because, yes indeed, we all need something to fill that space inside of us, and we often live around people whose space fillers exist in direct contradiction to our own. But there is not a hierarchy associated with this difference, although it may be hard to convince ourselves of this fact. 

I was (I thought) unable to get warmth and caring from my immediate surrounding, so I sought it in this distant and abstracted vision of a populace who could give me love if I did something worthy of it. 

And this was something I only recognized later through my work in physics. Applying the same wrongheaded personal philosophies to that work, namely working with the goal of impressing people and trying to astound others with my intellect and insight, working was made to be impossible. 



You attempt to imitate the superficial couture of their lives without imitating the essence. Because in all honesty the things that made these men great were the very things that make all men truly human. Such things are not connected to the specific acts of a life, but the faithful observation of the source from which they’re derived.  

The truth was that by working with the intent of impressing others, striving to astound them with my intellect and insight, I had ironically made working impossible. Physics and mathematics had become slaves to my insecurity and as constant reflections of that insecurity they had become bereft of all their nascent beauty. Whenever I read a paper or a textbook, I saw neither the questions the author sought nor the answers he found, I simply saw logical arguments I believed I could never replicate, insights I could never find, success I could never achieve. And just as quickly, the solid inviolable things which had given me a sense of meaning disappeared and were obscured by a vision which looked out at the world and only saw itself.

The slave cannot help but be a reflection (if only a token foil) of the master 

But the truth is if I work with the goal of impressing people, trying to astound them with my intellect and insight, working would be made impossible. Physics and mathematics would become a slave to my insecurity and as a constant reflection of that insecurity would become bereft of all its nascent beauty. And just like that, the solid thing which gave me a sense of meaning in this world would disappear. I have experienced this loss of faith very often. It would happen when I lost sight of the reason for my work, and conflated my own motivations with the motivations institutions or authority figures told me, explicitly or not, I should have. 

 I would gravitate to projects that I knew others (but not I) would appreciate, and I would disparage myself and all previous work I’ve done because it failed to fit into that structure. The end result was less like seeing the color drain out of the world than seeing a vibrant living world replaced with the vacuum of space. 


It was all because I was afraid. I was afraid of what my future could be without the success arrayed so nakedly in the lives of these great people. Who were these greats? They were not only the standard physicist idols: Feynman, Einstein, and Newton. There were also more contemporary examples like Jesse Thaler, Alex Rodriguez, and Philip Tanedo. And like a child looking for a home, I would read the stories of such seemingly successful people and believe I could obtain the value others ascribed to them if I used their lives as scripts for my own. 

But I was attempting to imitate the superficial couture of their lives without imitating the essence. 

But I was trying to live according to the permissions granted through example by the stories of people who were, quite simply, not me. Because if there was anything that made these people great, it was the very thing that makes all people truly human. Such things are not connected to the specific acts of a life, but to the faithful observation of the source, inevitably personal, from which these acts are derived.

Living your life according to the permissions granted through example by the lives of people who are, quite simply, not you.

I should not lie to myself about what my work means, what effect doing the work will have on me and on the world I occupy. That was one of my past mistakes, something not entirely drawn from the competitive and narcissistic world we live in today, but something arising from an implacable doubt in my self worth and a need to legitimize that worth by proving it to other people. 

I had always felt there are some things—like love, communal acceptance, and recognition—which are psychologically necessary in a human life, and while I still believe this I now recognize that such things cannot readily be peeled off anything I do in physics or mathematics. As such I cannot attempt (like I had in the past) to derive all of my psychological nourishment from physics itself. 

So all the things I thought my work could provide, things I believed existed in the world, and could hence exist for me, because I apparently saw them so ostentatiously arrayed in the lives of others, had to be dealt with and understood outside the context of physics and mathematics, things which could not bear the brunt of my insecurities because they were by constitution wholly irrelevant to them. 

Thus all the fame, love, and acknowledgement I thought my work could provide, rewards I believed existed in the world and could exist for me because I thought I saw them so clearly in the lives of others, had to be dealt with and understood outside the context of physics and mathematics, things which could not bear the brunt of my insecurities because they were by constitution wholly irrelevant to them. 


If I were being honest and rational, the truth is there is really nothing I can contribute to physics which would reveal itself to be so revolutionary at its inception as to be a manifestly necessary contribution the deluge of articles comprising modern scientific literature. And by such evaluation, I should rationally never contribute anything, and by such a decision eliminate any possibility of obtaining the recognition I claimed was so necessary for me. Thus by maintaining the philosophy that my value is only defined by the value other people claim I have, and being unable to prove that value through published work, I would have to conclude that I am worthless and my life is not worth living. So, a view of life meant to make me engage more fully with life seemed to demonstrate that that life should not be lived. But this conclusion, contradictory as it is, cannot capture the principle by which a life should be lived because it is grounded in delusions. 

One is a delusion born of ignorance of myself: a misunderstanding of what any external recognition could really mean to me. Another is a delusion born of myopia: a misunderstanding of what my work could possibly mean in the larger history of human beings. For recognition once achieved is never as fulfilling as it appears to be when we did not have it, and all the great works of the past can be made inconsequential or even invisible if we view them from a perspective which is orthogonal to the value system which precipitated them.

I could not see myself and so I so desperately needed others to see me. Through it all I was lying, lying about what me future work could mean, lying about the effect it could have on other people and the world I occupy, lying about the value my life would have were this effect not acknowledged. These were some of my past mistakes, things not entirely drawn from the competitive and narcissistic world we live in today, but instead arising from an implacable doubt in my self worth and a need to legitimize that worth by proving it to other people.

Through it all I was lying to myself, lying about what me future work could mean, lying about the effect it could have on other people and the world I occupy. This was one of my past mistakes, something not entirely drawn from the competitive and narcissistic world we live in today, but something arising from an implacable doubt in my self worth and a need to legitimize that worth by proving it to other people.

Yet, if something is truly a lie it must be a lie in both positive and negative directions and not only in the direction which is convenient. Therefore if my visions of failure were lies I told myself about the future, then my stories of previous success were also lies I told myself about the past.

Something not at all intrinsic to the product itself, but rather attached on afterwards. 

In spite of my previous pride in all that I had achieved, every external signifier of those achievements—the rewards I had received, the status obtained from good writing and good grades, and, especially, the money—were never things I took for myself. They were not accomplishments found at the top of a mountain I conquered through a solitary climb. They were, in fact, always given to me. Because whenever someone produces something of ostensible value, the success we see displayed in the world is always the result of an external recognition of that value. It comes from other people, and sometimes just one inordinately influential person, deciding this thing which previously was only important to one person or a few people, can have some wider significance. But external recognition, naturally a fickle arbiter, cannot be relied upon to supply a meaning and justification by which someone should live his or her life. To chase such gratification and to claim it as necessary sustenance would be to doom oneself to be forever unappreciative of the life one currently has.

Success was never something I took for myself. It was never the result of my engagement with a fixed and discernible universe. It was in fact always given to me. It was a dance I did with someone else. I was in the middle of the dance floor swinging and gyrating away, when someone came up to me and asked to join. In what sense would I alone have initiated the dance? Anytime one produces something the success, or at least what we in today’s culture define it as, always arises from some external recognition of value in the product. Such a fickle arbiter cannot be relied upon to supply a meaning and justification by which a person can live his life. To chase such gratification and to claim it as necessary sustenance would be to doom oneself to be forever  dissatisfied with and unappreciative of the life one currently has. 

It is a delusion of born of ignorance of what the work I do can really mean to me and a delusion born of myopia in defining what the work means in the larger history of human beings, not to mention the world and the universe. 

there really is nothing I can contribute to physics which would be so revolutionary as to be manifestly necessary at the conclusion of the paper. It was a delusion to think I would have been able to do so. A delusion in my abilities and a delusion in what posterity could say about such abilities. 

there is really nothing I can contribute to physics which would reveal itself to be so revolutionary at it’s inception as to be a manifestly necessary contribution to the deluge of articles which fill and continue to fill our scientific literature. 

Thus considering again all of my former and current heroes, the essence of what made them who they were, the quality that made them special and so unlike their peers, was a subscription to personal integrity regardless of the potential acceptance and cultural significance. They worked for things they saw as valuable instead of chasing the things everyone else deemed important. Sometimes widespread recognition existed at the end of such a path, but it often did not. And thus there are many such people, people who did not need the world to see them because they could see themselves, who are largely unknown to most of us. 

————

But we should hope—and this is the fundamental hope—that they are not unknown to themselves. We should hope that they recognize a value in what they have done independent of whether they were recognized by the modern systems of publicity, systems originally only meant to support such work but which have degenerated into means of codifying and ranking it. So there is a value which although created by people, exists apart from the standards people typically employ to measure that value. This is ultimately why I work. I work to restore my vision of a world with logic and order. I work to recognize and make actionable use of the agency I so constantly want to deny. I work in order to exist, if only temporarily, within a space I can appreciate and discern for myself. 

This is a perspective of work not at all seen in the standard hagiographic depictions of famous scientists. The reader may see diligence, prowess, and erudition, but what they cannot see, quite simply because they cannot feel it themselves, is the emotional draw which began the work in the first place. And when discussing the meaning an individual scientist finds in her work, this animal-like unarticulated attraction is most of what there is. 

The world which exists today, that is the world that is nakedly manifest in our current events, relationships, dreams, and fears, is not a world I can immediately trust. But it is a world which upon deeper inspection reveals a truth beautiful enough to have faith in. 




Because the “world” which exists today, the world which is nakedly manifest in the way most of us engage with current events and other people, is certainly not a world I trust and is not a world which upon deeper inspection reveals a truth beautiful enough to have faith in.












And thus there are many such people who are largely anonymous to most us, who did not desperately need the world to see them because they could see themselves, people who the world does not know Thus there are many such people 

(Something Is Missing)

What I am getting at is the “why” of my work. Why do I work? In the past I worked (although I lied to myself about it)/

I will not delude myself by stating conclusively why I work. From the experience of making many such statements, I know such a declaration is likely a mask for the motivations I rarely acknowledge because I am ashamed of them. Instead, I will try to describe the motivations I want to have, the drives I think represent more positive modes of engaging with my work.  What do I want to work for?

I can no longer work in pursuit of the external recognition I so desperately wanted. One must be clear of what belongs to one and what does not and should not cling to the things which were only temporarily in one’s possession. 

Why do I want to work? I do p

Why do I work? I do physics each day to restore my vision of a world with logic and order and structure all of which seem to exist in opposition to the senseless arbitrarity of modern life. A physicist once maligned current trends in physics claiming that they existed as worlds that people—who did not want to deal with the real world, both physical and not—escaped into. And the fact of this apparent escape cannot be disputed, but the connotation of the fact and the motivations of the people involved is not accurate. 

For me my work is not an escape, but is a deeper engagement.

It is an attempt to peel back the external layer of the world and see what’s really there. And I mean “really there” in the most grandiose, possibly scientifically tone-deaf, way imaginable. 

An attempt to filter out or remove oneself from the noise 


 Because the “world” which exists today, the world which is nakedly manifest in the way most of us engage with current events and other people, is certainly not a world I trust and is not a world which upon deeper inspection reveals a truth beautiful enough to have faith in. One can argue that our narratives of history have shown that within the context of the meanness, smallness, and fatal ignorance of human communities there have always been individuals whose moral philosophies were in line with our own and which therefore demonstrate the hope for humanity that existed in our past and (since the recent moral past really is largely indistinguishable from the now) exists surely enough in our present. But because these stories were predominately by people who had the sway and power—rarely chastening influences—to get their narratives accepted, I don’t have faith in the sense ascribed to our history. And so for me there is no faith I can blithely propagate to the present. We may reify and contemplate the tragedies of the past, claiming that since everything is mostly OK now, everything is (and was) OK in some fundamental sense, but I don’t believe this. The tragedies meted out in the lives of the fatalistically unfortunate individuals of the past exist as surely today as they did back then, and thus those who place a blind faith in the world as it exists today simply because they find themselves in a situation which is comfortable and clean are merely setting the stage for their own inevitable disillusionment. 

People compartmentalize their spectrum of options into a coarse binary, not because the world is black and white, but because it is simply easier to engage with it when we assume it’s so. But I think the distinction between the two different ways of doing my work is real because I have found them often to be immiscible. You can either do the work for yourself, first, and pursue something that you value and recognize, and thus give credence to the appreciation you feel for it and the joy you obtain from it. Or you could do the work for other people, and therefore make it very difficult for you to do.   

It is important to understand why you do something because you are inevitably going to be (or currently are) part of systems and institutions which will not only define objectives for your life but will also silently suggest why those objectives are valuable. And in such situations you have to decide whether you agree with the system’s “why”s and can identify with them. But in some sense, the decision has already been made simply by who you are. The actual decision is in what to do with the knowledge when you find there is a genuine conflict between who you are and who the communities of which you are a part tell you to be. It’s a decision of whether to hide this knowledge from yourself and spend your life ignoring references to it, completely succumbing to the message implicit in the knowledge and subsequently condemning yourself to the periphery, or trying to understand and contextualize the knowledge and thereby make it actionable in your life. Regardless, our nascent motivations are always present and always affecting us, whether or not we choose to engage with them.

and use it as a foundation for a clearer vision of yourself. (hopefully) redirect it, or something else. But recognize that the “why” is always there and always affecting you, whether you choose to engage with it or not.

Too Many Problems
So you’re experiencing something pretty cool. In your personal problems notes, it seems you have too many problems! It’s not that it would be impossible to answer them all; just horribly inefficient. So now you’re in the excellent position of having to choose which problems you devote your time and energy to. I won’t lay out a specific list of guidelines for what problems you should now solve (I’ve done so before and we know that didn’t turn out so well), BUT I think it should be pretty clear when the problem you’re solving is an act of procrastination/diversion (which itself is not horrible sometimes) or an effort to build something larger. 

OK. So I really can’t stop myself from making a small suggestion. I encourage you to lean towards solving problems which may lead to understanding something physically or mathematically new. Of course it’s hard to judge such problems at the start of a work, but I think it’s easy to tell when a problem will not lead towards anything new.

For: Fountainhead and Fraternity
We believe that our personal values and thoughts are wrong not only because the media and our communities tacitly tell us they are but also because we don’t always see these values reflected in the culture at large. But it is precisely because these values are not reflected in the larger culture that they are invaluable. This I think was a fundamental message of the Fountainhead. It suggested that even if others (and perhaps especially if others) do not share our values we have a responsibility to remain faithful to them.

(Don’t use the catch phrase “the media”; be more specific)
…
It is an interesting fact of the MIT experience that virtually no student enters MIT with the express intent of becoming a part of Greek life, but nearly half of them eventually do. I think it is in reaction to the subdued coldness of living and working in the technocratic bubble which is MIT and partly a submission to the Greek system itself. lazy

An Explanation for and a Response to “Why I Hated Physics/Math Papers”
I am beginning to understand why I disliked physics and mathematics papers for so long and so consistently. It was not only because they seemed concerned with questions I really didn’t care about, but also because they were structured in ways I found intellectually abhorrent. For so many papers there was no suggestion as to the reason the paper was written, and the subsequent discussion in the paper seemed to bear out this lack. 

When I was working, ardently, exasperatingly, to fit myself into the existing culture of physics, my dislike of modern physics papers was a solid and dark obstacle. But now I can recognize this discontent as something of a tool. In her interview on “The One You Feed” podcast, Maria Popova quoted Austin Kleon saying  “Make the thing you want to see in the world. Write the books you want to read. Do the art you want to see. Make the music you want to hear.” She later summarized this sentiment by herself saying “Put the values into the world that you would like to see thrive and persevere.” And Toni Morrison once said “If there’s a book you want to read, but it hasn’t been written yet, then you must write it.” In this sense my task is set. If I dislike the content and structure of current physics papers, then I must write the kinds of papers I want to read.

On the Seemingly Unread Authors of Amazon
Whenever I read a particularly unique and perceptive piece of writing, I always return to the start of the work to take a second look at the author’s name. And upon discovering that I had never heard of the writer before and then later seeing that their books had no reviews on major websites and searches for their name were drowned out by the many other anonymous people who were apparently just like them, I would feel a reflexive sense of regret that this writer did not have the fame and renown their work properly deserved. How unfortunate, I would think, that this person did so much and did it so well, and yet their work was seemingly for nothing since it goes unread and unappreciated.

But this perspective perhaps is not, and certainly should not be, the way these so called ‘unread writers' see themselves, and, more deviously, represents an inaccurate framing of what is truly significant and influential in the world. The publicity a viewer ascribes to an achievement is such a clear function not only of what the viewer values (for why would she pay attention to the publicity were she not intrigued by the work itself), but also of what the culture values, that it’s difficult to say conclusively that this recognition has any objective standard. And we are so surrounded by the external trappings of success—the money, the positions of power, the self aggrandizing, but myopic, cultural relevance—that we begin to believe these things are worthy of pursuit in of themselves, or that they are more valuable than their experiential antecedents.

There are many books* written by writers who you (and most people) have never heard of which have had profound influences on my life. None of these writers know who I am—a fact that exists at the core of doing any creative work that is eventually released to a largely anonymous public—but they have affected me. And thus the significance inherent in these works exists not in their number of reviews on Amazon, or in the number of articles written about them, but in the impact they have in the lives of individual readers, both readers who themselves may eventually have profound and well advertised affects on the world and readers who will live, what looks like from the outside, more pedestrian lives. And although this impact is sometimes evident in the standard media channels, it is no less diminished if it is not.

Moreover, having myself done work that only a few people have seen, it has become clear to me that if the inception and motivation for the work has its origins in a good place (i.e., a place which is not focused on obtaining the standard measures of success), there is typically a deep satisfaction in doing and eventually finishing the work regardless of any subsequent outcome. This satisfaction, I like to believe, is what these anonymous authors obtained by writing their books and articles; the sense of a personal need fulfilled and a good piece of work completed. Given this, why otherwise should they care what anyone thinks concerning the popularity of their work?

Dreams of Recent Nights
I have been having dreams each night since I returned to New Orleans. Most of the dreams I no longer remember, but two seem to stand out for being particularly strange. 

In the dream I had last night I was with my sister in some house. Even this I’m not sure of. Was it a house? Were we really initially there together? Dreams have this special quality of being able to fade into and out of focus while still remaining emotionally tactile. You don’t remember the details, but something inside you retains the marks of an experience you only lived in your mind. 

Regardless of where we were and what we were doing there, we apparently had to leave early in the morning to catch a train. But late at night, I awoke to see that my sister was already up and preparing to leave. Unbeknownst to her, I scrambled to get dressed and leave with her but she was well ahead of me. One image stands stark in my mind. I am on one side of the street as across on the other side my sister is sprinting in pursuit of something I cannot see. I feel she is leaving me behind. I give chase but she is well ahead of me. I follow her down the street and I eventually turn a corner which leads to train tracks with brick layered arches framing every five yards. My sister is nowhere in sight, until I retrace my steps and, with my father, she appears. I am disconsolate as I ask her what happened. She is confused, and I am hysterical. “Why did you leave me?” I asked, “We were supposed to leave together.”  “I was trying to catch the train.” she told me. I asked her why she didn’t wake me up when she left in the morning. Even she seems uncertain about the reason. “I don’t know,” she starts, “It was like when you just have this thing on your mind which blocks out all other thought.” This thing was apparently her need to catch this train, wherever it was going. But seeing as she was standing there speaking to me it seemed that this thing she felt was so necessary had not been achieved. After this conversation, I woke up and stared at my ceiling. 

The other dream featured Ariel Amir. It too was strange, unnerving, and it too had a beginning which has now faded from memory. I had the dream Saturday night, the day my sister left to return to Silver Springs Maryland. In the dream I am ahead of Amir and we’re exiting a bus. Suddenly I feel a push from my back, and being atypically uninhibited I whirl around facing Amir. I shove him back hard, and he stumbles into the bus. “Why did you push me?!” I yell it. “Why did you push me!” I say again. Amir is confused and clearly angry. “I did not push you”. “I felt it! I felt it!” I am acting crazy. Amir’s eyes narrow. He’s done with the conversation and, also, with me. He exits the bus and strangely as he walks down the street Raphael appears by his side. They walk and talk together, and having apparently returned to a more stable operation of mind, I follow them. Now I am scared. Ariel is my advisor and it appears I have made an enemy of him. What would happen now? What would I do now? The fear begins in my chest and reaches up towards my throat, choking inhales, accelerating exhales. The anxiety remains even as I transition from the dream into reality. 

So what do these mean? An uninspired fear of abandonment? I have no skills in interpreting dreams, but if I were to do so with these I would say that I think my relationships with people (even my sister) are more tenuous than they appear to be in reality. Or is my mind merely representing a reality it can intuit but which has not been made explicit in my mind?

[//]


In the quiet spaces at night I have often felt an inexplicable emptiness, a sense that everything I have ever done and will ever do will not be enough to fill this gap, always vaguely felt and seemingly ever growing. 
And it seems that it is only the things I contribute to the world, my writing my work in physics and mathematics my deep relationships with people, that act in opposition to this meaninglessness, like lights warding away an encroaching darkness.

Belonging
From many of my experiences of feeling like an outsider, I have learned the less you feel like you belong, the more you probably do. But not in the superficial sense by which most people claim to identify belonging, not in the way who they are seems to naturally and easily fit into who the community tacitly wants them to be. But in a more fundamental sense, in the fact that the dissonance you feel, if positively integrated into the community of which you are apart can lead that community to grow and expand upon its original definition. These people—people who can have more fidelity to the principles of a community, than they naturally do to the human needs for acceptance and solidarity—are as necessary to the community, arguably even more so, as the people who exist more comfortably within it. 

2nd Version
The less I felt like I belonged, the more I probably did. But not in the superficial sense by which most people claim to identify belonging, not in the way who I was seemed to naturally and easily fit into who the community wanted, if only tacitly, me to be. But in a more fundamental sense, in the fact that the dissonance I felt, if positively integrated into the community could lead it to grow and expand upon its original definition.

It turns out, and perhaps this is unsurprising because I have always in a sense known it to be true, I like doing research when I’m the one choosing the questions.

On the Ubiquity of Harmonic Oscillators 

It is only when we cannot clearly see ourselves that we so fervently demand that others see us. 

It seems that it was only when I could not clearly see myself that I so desperately needed others to see me.

My Old Notebooks
I knew what I expected to find, but I didn’t perfectly anticipate how it would make me feel. I think I imagined feeling something more inspirational when I looked though all of my previous work. Maybe, I thought, seeing all that I have done these years would give me a firmer sense of self, it would remind me of everything I had accomplished and learned and would therefore bolster me in the moments when I felt I had achieved nothing of value. 

But instead of pride, the predominant reaction was one of shame and anger. The work was too much and too multifarious, and all seemingly to no end. Notebooks, some half filled, others with no blank page to spare, from subjects I studied on my own and in school. Putting aside the MIT course notebooks—many of which contain material (like D-branes, and the Gillespie Algorithm) I do not remember writing down let alone learning—my search eventually became focused on finding my first notebook of quantum field theory calculations, a blue Five Star Mead graph paper notebook from 2008/2009. But as I looked through my personal notebooks dating from 2008 and containing notes on my studies in electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, and quantum field theory, what initially was a patient perusal became something more hysterical. 

In these notebooks were thousands of pages of long calculations, notes, and worked out problems, many of which surely took days or weeks to complete and virtually none of which I remember completing. I flipped through these pages in a half-restraint, not wanting to continue seeing work of which I had no recollection and yet at the same time perversely feeling compelled see what else I had done. Surely, I told myself, the results of these notes sit somewhere in my mind, and they were just perhaps in places made inaccessible due to the intervening years of self loathing. But after some time, the new feelings of disgust were too overwhelming and I had to stop my search. 

For although the work was great in quantity and quality, it seemed that given what came after it had all meant nothing to me. Because after years of such work, I valued it so little and valued the person who did it even less that it could not act as buoy to save me from myself. Even with all this work in the background of my life, I still bought a gun in July 2014 and resolved to end my life. 

So there is shame and anger, paradoxically arising both from failing to appreciate all the work I had done and also from doing work that could be so easily disregarded. But not all of this anger is directed inward. Indeed, I can’t help but feel a large degree of animosity towards an external world—conveniently (as it always is for hatred) vaguely defined—which led me to believe the narratives that painted my life as worthless. It was of course my choice, even if only an unconscious one, to believe these narratives, but I was not the one who created them. And as such, looking through my notebooks made me recognize there is a virus in America and perhaps in the world, one which is not merely defined by racism, classism, sexism, the lottery of birth, but bearing representations of all these vices and more. There is something in this place that makes it easy and thus likely for a person to lose sight of him or herself, and even abandon that self simply due to the aggregate messages from the culture which tell him he is not, and will never be, enough.  

This is my rationalization of what happened to me, and as all rationalizations are, its truth is more faithfully represented in the intent to construct an understandable reality and not in the reality constructed. But we must all live our lives by narratives, and narratives by nature rarely interpret the world cleanly or without slant. So the mistake is not in adopting a particular narrative; it is in adopting the wrong one. 

I was living (and perhaps still live) according to a story which depicted me as less valuable than I could be seen. And even when I was fighting this vision, I was indirectly legitimizing it by engaging with it as though it could possibly be true of reality. I cannot pretend that I see a lesson which can be abstracted from this experience. It is still too raw to process. All I feel is an anger and an intense desire to make that anger manifest in the world.

Added to White Supremacy
You begin to walk around the world with a general abrasiveness, a sense of being tied up together more tensely than you know you should be. It comes from being around people who take it as a fundamental assumption that they are in some unarticulated and conveniently nonspecific way ‘better than you’, not because they really know you or even because they really know themselves (in fact it is precisely because they don’t really know you or themselves that they can believe such a thing) but because for all their life they have been receiving messages both explicit and implicit that they exist at the top of a (racial and/or gendered, include or dont?) caste system.

Unfortunate
The unfortunate fact (about life?) is that the things we think may save us and the things which ultimately destroy us are often one and the same. 

Tragic
One of the tragic things about wanting things is that we almost never get the things we think we so desperately need when we need them. Rather, these things always seem to try to enter our lives after we have found ways to live without them or after we no longer have the space for them.

Notes: AdS/CFT
I’m trying to learn about the Ads/CFT. One of the things that’s helped prevent fatigue so far is not becoming so focused on learning this specific area of high energy physics that I become incapable of appreciating other areas. Namely, I study something from the AdS/CFT for a while and then I study something else. 

Also, I’ve realized that is is not very useful to focus on the details of derivations at the moment. I might be able to get these details down, but seeing as I don’t understand the larger purpose of this technique/field I really wouldn’t understand the direction of the derivation even if I understand the basic steps. 

So right now I’m trying to determine what the end goal of this procedure is, and why this end goal is important. More practically, I want to know what questions the Ads/CFT correspondence helps us answer and why one should care about those questions. Inevitably, I might not agree with these reasons but knowing them is a good start for analysis. 

As a first statement, most discussions of the Ads/CFT I’ve seen state that it equates the partition function of a conformal field theory (which is a yang mills theory) to the partition function of an AdS theory (which is ostensibly a gravitational theory). This equating allows one to compute the correlation function operators in the conformal field theory in terms of the partition function of the AdS theory. (Supposedly because the latter is easier to evaluate) [//]

Quenched vs. Annealed
Just today I think I understood the difference between quenched and annealed disordered systems. Quenched colloquially corresponds to a fast—and essentially, on thermodynamic time scales, instantaneous—relaxation while ‘annealed’ corresponds to a slower relaxation which occurs with thermodynamic relaxation. The instantaneous nature of quenched disorder (i.e. a disorder created by “quenching a system”) implies it cannot be modeled by thermal fluctuations while the slower nature of annealed disorder (i.e., disorder creating through annealing) can. 

Mathematically, the canonical ensemble (by the ergodic theorem) translates time averages into ensemble averages (because, again by the ergodic theorem, a state in a system, over time, traverses the relevant phase space densely). Thus, a system which is fluctuating thermally can be taken to be represented by a collection of states which are encoded into the partition integral. When we have an additional parameter which fluctuates on a time scale coincident with thermal fluctuations, then we can ensemble average over this parameter as though it were another variable of the partition integral. This is the case with annealed disorder. But when we have a parameter which enters our system effectively constant (because it equilibrates on time scales much faster than those associated with thermal fluctuations), then we cannot place it on equal footing with an ensemble average because it’s time average is NOT on equal footing. Instead, we need to average this disordered variable over a macroscopic time independent quantity like the free energy. 

This is a rough description, but I think the basics are OK. In summary, 
quenched disorder: the parameter must be averaged over time independent physical quantities, like the free energy, because it comes into the system constant. 
annealed disorder: the parameter can be included in the path integral as a path integral like function. 

The replica method is needed because the averaging in the quenched disorder case is difficult to do (since we’re integrating the logarithm of a partition function). 


Hi Hugo,

I recognize this is out of the blue. Are you still on campus? Are you free to meet up some time?

Hugo
Days ago I had a dream about Hugo. I wouldn’t say it was completely out of the blue. Days before I had been thinking about him on and off, in mixtures of fantasy and recollection. In a way I had been thinking about all of the people who had interested me in the past. All this was spurred on by my reading of Andre Aciman’s Call Me By Your Name. The story, which took me a few pages not to loathe, and a few dozens of pages more to like and eventually appreciate, mostly tracks the seemingly unrequited interest a boy has in Oliver, the summer visitor staying in his parents’ home. The book begins with this boy immersed in fantasy about the visitor, all described in a lurid and maudlin tone I didn’t think was sufficiently justified. But through such descriptions, the reader is eventually able to assemble a picture of Oliver, a picture both conveniently and realistically incomplete, as our perceptions of those we love typically are.

The interest is, by assumption and by any cursory analysis of the boy’s interactions with the visitor, one sided. The reader mostly sees only two things; the boy’s interest in the visitor, so ever present as to be at times suffocating; and images of the visitor filtered through the warped lens of someone in love with him. So of course we not only get the sense that Oliver is a charismatic and humanely perceptive scholar, but also that he is temperamental and distant. In one scene, Oliver, Elio (the narrator), and his parents are eating dinner and discussing something about literature. Elio intercedes at one point with an insightful comment, one which although indeed relevant to the discussion is grounded in the intent to impress Oliver. But when Elio looks up at Oliver the eyes looking back at him are hard and vaguely hostile. Elio is astonished by the animosity in the reaction which is leagues away from the one he anticipated. Later, Elio describes Oliver as galavanting around town visiting other families and apparently sleeping with many women, all in ostensible indifference to whether he sees Elio (or Elio sees him) or not. But there are small snatches where the interest Elio feels appears to be reciprocated. In one scene, Elio knocks over a cup while he’s studying and Oliver comes over, picks up the cup, and places it back on the desk. “You didn’t have to do that” Elio says, and in a way which is altogether too intimate and serious for the event that precipitated it, Oliver looks into Elio’s eyes and says “I wanted to.”

In short, the signals seem to go both ways—as they always seem to do in situations like this—and the reader is left wondering if Elio is really seeing indications of Oliver’s hidden (for whatever reason) interest or simply his own interest, analyzed and reanalyzed to the point that it is reflected back upon him. We are given a clue as to where this is all building to in a tennis scene. Not completely out of character but certainly in a way distinct enough to deserve inspection, Oliver arches his arm across Elio’s shoulder and squeezes it chummily. Elio tenses and recoils from the embrace and Oliver is visibly shocked. 

Externally, this would seem like a rejection, but of course the reader has been with Elio for many pages, and even without his introspective analysis of this event we would pretty clearly see what’s really going on. As Elio describes it, Oliver’s initial touch was a shock, not only because the act itself was unexpected but also because of the involuntary reaction it induced in him. Elio felt himself going slack and falling into Oliver’s arm, a response that would have immediately dissolved the image of the distant and uninterested spectator that he was cultivating. So to save himself from this unconscious reaction, he consciously jerked himself away. Thus an action which from an external and decontextualized perspective had one clear and unambiguous interpretation, reveals itself upon deeper analysis to have an entirely different one. 

Maybe, one wonders, although Oliver’s signals seem to go both ways, if one had the proper dictionary by which to interpret them, it would be clear that they only really point in a single direction. Knowing partly the conclusion of this story, we realize that this must be the case, but it is nevertheless illuminating to hear Oliver’s explanation of this himself. Apparently, Oliver liked Elio from the beginning. The nights he spent galavanting around town were not nights he spent sleeping with women but were rather spent sitting on the seashore thinking. The look he gave Elio after his dinner comment was not one of animosity but one of unregulated interest. This particular explanation which initially seems to be Aciman’s cop out to wrap up the story, is admittedly valid when you consider that you never really know what your own eyes are doing when you’re looking at someone you’re interested in. 

A few weeks ago I received a reminder that my perspective on the world and my relationships with people may not be the discerning interpretations of reality I thought they were. In what I eventually concluded to be a delusional fervor, I emailed Dr. Hightower asking to meet with her before I returned to Cambridge. The focus of my mind was something which happened a year and a half before. I had left Franklin Prep abruptly and unceremoniously informing Dr. Hightower in an email that I had found another job. She did not respond to the email, so I thought that she was reasonably displeased with the suddenness of my departure and my way of conveying it. I certainly would have been had I been on the receiving end. This dissonance between the way I acted and the way I knew I should have acted disturbed me (It certainly contributed to the breakdown I experienced two weeks later), so in this meeting I wanted to apologize to her. The Franklin Prep event was the last time I saw her, so I imagined it would be as present in her mind as it was in mine. But when we met, there was no indication that she even remembered the event. She spoke mostly about renovating her house, her interaction with her neighbor and asked me about how my research and my studies were going. I was initially intent on interjecting the apology any way I could, but I abandoned the idea halfway through our conversation when I realized there was no natural way to even introduce the topic. 

It was surprising to see reality transform seemingly before my eyes, to see the world I had built in my mind prove itself to be completely unrelated to the one I physically shared with other people. 

I have always recognized complexities in myself, the ways I could mask or intermittently reverse my interest in order to hide it. But I always took the surface level of other people’s actions as to be completely transparent indications of how they actually felt. To be fair, who knows if there is always something lying deeper beneath such actions, but using merely myself as an example, it should be clear that it is incorrect to assume there never is.

So it was with this new knowledge that I involuntarily began to review my previous experiences of unreciprocated interest. At the fore front of my mind was Hugo, who I had liked ever since our first meeting during a study break when he guessed I was a theorist. We went indoor rock climbing together and then over the course of months, something which initially seemed to be so promising degenerated into the distant and forcefully courteous greetings which framed most of my interactions with people. At the beginning he appeared warm and friendly, at one point noting that I got a haircut (something that white people never notice about black people), complimenting a shirt I was wearing (something that guys who are not friends do not usually mention about each other), and commenting that I clearly worked out a lot (admittedly a comment that I receive pretty often). But after one moment in the hallway when he seemed to turn my way, register my presence, and then turn back around and walk in the complete opposite direction something changed. I of course felt rejected by this interaction, and I immediately re-calibrated my already obsessively tailored interactions with him. More formality, more distance. I was saving face, trying to prove more to myself than to him that I didn’t care about anything that had or could have happened between us. And I suppose this was the beginning of the end. Later I told myself that whatever I initially saw, what eventually came to my vision was indeed the truth.

Unless it wasn’t. Reading Aciman’s book forced me to reinterpret what happened with Hugo. But I did not do this carefully; I did this haphazardly and indirectly through day dreams and fantasies most of which were sexual. I thought back to the image I saw of him shirtless in the Brooklyn Boulders locker room, his body thicker and more defined than it seemed to be under all his clothes. I placed this vision of him in boxers sitting on my bed cross legged in front of me. All this proceeded consciously, images of him melding into images of Mush and Cheng and Sebastian and Freddy and then again separating from those images to stand alone. 

And then Monday night I had a dream about him. The dream is too foggy to remember entirely, but what stands out now is one conversation. He’s talking to me in an apologetic tone explaining that while either he or I was a way, he kissed another guy. In a small frame somewhere in the room was a picture with him and the guy. The guy looked like me, but was not me. As always happens after such dreams, I woke up feeling preternaturally close to him. And as Tuesday grew from day into night, the feeling that I needed to contact him grew as well. But of course I couldn’t do so, right? I hadn’t spoken to him in a year and a half. And we were not exactly friends. But the feeling remained. I tried to write it off as another one of my delusional musings. I wanted to delete his number from my phone to prevent myself from contacting him, but it was not there to begin with; apparently it was never transferred to my new phone. 

I found myself inadvertently trying to find him online. He didn’t have a Facebook profile. No personal website. I eventually found his Harvard email, and was strangely comforted by the fact that I now had someway to contact him. But I still thought it was crazy to do so. I decided to sleep on it, and email him in the morning if the desire was still there. Wednesday morning, finding that the desire was ever present, I sent him an email asking if he was still in Cambridge and if we could meet sometime. 

My rationale was as follows: I had this sense that he certainly had no interest in hearing from me again, but I was not absolutely sure. And given that I might have misinterpreted the events that led me to distance myself from him, I wanted to know concretely what these events had meant. Or at least, considering that my own signals had been mixed and this ambiguity may have led to the dissolution we eventually experienced, I wanted to apologize for it—I am ever trying to apologize for something—and tell him I was acting so strangely because I was pretending not to be interested. In any case, I needed to get some sense of how he felt now, because that would suggest how he had felt back then. I could get this sense more clearly if we met, but I could also get something from his response to my email. An awkwardly phrased statement questioning why we should meet would suggest I was making more of this issue than it deserved. Silence, always ambiguous, would suggest anything from him not receiving the email to him not wanting to meet, the latter of which could point to anger or indifference. Overt hostility would indicate that my previous interpretations had been mostly on point. 

Ever the cynic, I wanted overt hostility most of all, but I knew my mind would do what it could with either silence or an unclear response. Inevitably there would be a firming of my previous interpretations of the world and my role in it. This would just be one more indication that I am one of those people for whom non-platonic relationships just are not possible.

But he responded and his response was warm, more so than I had ever expected. He said it was great to hear from me again, and that he was busy this weekend, but that we could meet next week, and finally at the end of the email he asked what I had in mind for our meet up. I had no idea what we should do. I was so focused on the possible interpretations I could assign to silence, I had not planned what I would say in its ironical absence.

AdS/CFT: What’s the Point and Diffusion Coefficient 
So what’s the point of the AdS/CFT? The general idea of the conjecture is that it’s possible to relate the expectation values of operators in a quantum field theory to a corresponding theory of gravity. This is apparently useful because there are some quantum field theory problems which are insoluble when we attempt to solve them using quantum field theory alone but are simplified if we represent them as problems of quantum gravity. Some examples that I’ve discovered recently include

Wilson Line for Super Yang Mills Theory (Maldacena’s Paper)
Jet Quenching Parameter for Strongly Coupled Systems (Rajagopal’s and Liu’s Paper)
Viscosity Entropy Ratio for Plasma Fluids (??)

Also, in the paper which originally showed that the viscosity could be computed with a form of the conjecture, the authors expressed the viscosity in terms of an energy momentum tensor product which was reminiscent to me of how the diffusion coefficient can be expressed as the Fourier transform of the velocity auto correlation function. In other words, it seems that it might be possible to compute the diffusion coefficient, if not for an instant gas, certainly for a non-abelian gauge theory. 

Also Jaynes (I think that’s his name) wrote a book where he computed various quantities for particle gases. These quantities were
— viscosity is momentum transport
— diffusion is density transport
— ?? is energy transport
I wonder if it’s possible to do something similar with a non-abelian gauge theory.

Geometry and Energy and Mathematical Formalism
It is almost a statement beaten to death with me. Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity treat geometry and energy on dual footings. As a possible way to enmesh the two theories, then it might be necessary to develop or find a mathematical formalism where the two can be treated on equal footing. Namely, is there a formalism in which the mathematical representations of the standard physics concepts of geometry and energy are equivalent?
How is geometry defined? Via Boundary Conditions, Background Spacetime
How is energy defined? Via Eigenvalues, Symmetry current of spacetime translations

Things to look at 
Chern Simons Theory (and Topological Quantum Field Theories): I hear this is a field theory which completely eliminates the background spacetime. Which would be quite interesting, no?

9:19 AM
Probability, Length Scale, and Quantum Corrections
This all might be a huge coincidence. Shannon’s entropy formula scales as “p log p” for probabilities p, while in quantum field theory quantum corrections come in the form “lambda log lambda” for energy scale lambda. So information in a probabilistic system has a similar form as quantum corrections in a field theoretic system. This is not surprising if once considers that quantum corrections arise from the inherent uncertainty of the system, an uncertainty which can indeed by defined in terms of an entropy. But if this connection is real then there would need to be a way to connect the probability “p” to to the energy scale “lambda”. The only way I could think of doing this is to convert the energy scale into a length scale, so that the problem is more easily represented as an attempt to connect probability “p” to a length scale “L”. 

Crackpot Manic Episode Time! (Where I unrigorously connect many disparate concepts in physics): SO! The only statistical system I know of in which a probability is connected to a length scale, is the random walk problem. This problem has fractal elements, and it’s possible to formula field theories on fractal space times. SO, if it is possible to formulate a quantum field theory on the random walk trajectory, it might be possible to find an explicit connection between the entropy of the random walk and the quantum correction of the quantum field theory.

Our Family Members
We are rarely seen as real people by our family members, for, in their eyes, we are always constrained and defined by the roles we automatically assumed when we first entered their lives. Thus the truism that, parents will always see, together with all the benefits and limitations such a perspective supplies, their children as children, and children will always see their parents, biological or not, as parents.

“It seemed to me that Lamming was suggesting to the conference a subtle and difficult idea, the idea that part of the great wealth of the Negro experience lay precisely in its double-edgedness. He was suggesting that all Negroes were held in a state of supreme tension between the difficult, dangerous relationship in which they stood to the white world and the relationship, not a whit less painful of dangerous, in which they stood to each other. He was suggesting that in the acceptance of this duality lay their strength, that in this, precisely, lay their means of defining and controlling the world in which they lived.”

Why I like “Statistical Physics of Self-Replication”

I do like the clarity of the writing in the paper and it can certainly be described as elegant seeing as the “mathematics-to-implications” ratio is really high, but what I really appreciate about the paper is how it truly respects the aims of what is presently termed “biological physics”. 

All subjects in physics are unified by a particular approach to studying the world, namely an approach which is inevitably mathematical and logically deductive.  On the other hand, all subjects in biology, on are unified by the subject matter of study; biology concerns any and everything we can characterize as living. The result is that biological models are typically very specific to a domain and precisely mirror the world, while solutions to physical problems are often general but replace the world with a simpler proxy. 

The fundamental dilemma of biological physics is to answer questions on the boundary of these apparently immiscible subject. That is biological physics aims to answer questions about life using the mathematical-deductive approach of physics. 

A lot of work in what people think of as biophysics is, in my opinion, just dressed up statistical and mathematical modeling. Scientists couch a biological process in quantitative terms, but there are often no deeper physical ideas present. But what I like about this paper is that it uses a very simple physical idea (the fact that entropy increases, and hence heat is released, when the disorder in a system increases) to establish bounds on a common biological process (self replication). 




The aim of the paper is to show that a property of an ubiquitous biological process (self replication) is constrained by physical laws (

The result is that solutions to biological problems are specific and quite true to the world, while solutions to physical problems are general but often unrealistic. The dilemma of biological physics is to answer questions on the boundary of these apparently immiscible subjects.  

Do the anagramic possibilities of the word bedroom, suggest a truth which seems anything but coincidental?

Picture of Jen and Zack in Mug
CERN Mug

Because I am poor and uncreative I am giving you the CERN mug as part of your birthday present. But I recall you opposing the gift because you were afraid people might ask you about the equations written on the side. Alas! There is hope! Not only will I give you the mug, but I will also use my rudimentary and underutilized science knowledge to give you a rundown of what you need in order to understand it. The equation is as follows

L = Gauge Field Strength + Dirac Kinetic term + h.c. + Yukawa Interaction + h.c. + Higgs Kinetic + h.c. + Bosonic Potential

We see we have an equation which states that “cursive L” is equal to a some complicated sum of terms. The “cursive L” stands for Lagrangian. In classical physics the Lagrangian is generally used as a means of computing the dynamics of systems. Specifically it is used as an alternative to Newton’s Laws. In order to understand how positions, angles, etc. evolve you can either write out all the forces or you can write a lagrangian

(Draw a picture as an example: Maybe have a pendulum attached to an oscillator and have a dcases pointing towards newton’s laws or lagrangians)

In quantum physics, lagrangians are also used to compute the dynamics of systems, but they do not really provide the same information as the typical quantum mechanical approach. The typical way you solve quantum mechanics problems, is that you write out the hamiltonian and solve the Schrodinger equation. This gives you information on the energy spectrum of a quantum system, the probability of transitions, or simply the probability density functions for the constituent particles. 

(Picture: Schrodinger equation and hamiltonian: energy spectrum, probability of transition, probability density function, )

In quantum physics the lagrangian appears in what is known as a path integral. The path integral computes the probability for a quantum mechanical system initially at one position $x$ at time $t$ to transition to another position $x’$ at time $t’$. When we are studying the quantum theory of fields, the path integral generally allows us to understand how fields interact. 

One of the great historical ironies of physics is that Feynman, who is primarily responsible for the incorporation of Lagrangians in quantum physics, during his undergraduate years spurned their use in classical physics claiming they obscured a real physical understanding of the relevant system. (Jagdish Mehra, Beat of a Different Drum)

So that’s “cursive L”. Here it is essentially stating that the RHS of the equation defines the dynamics of the relevant system we’re studying. The system we’re studying is elementary particle interactions. 

Now a comment about the general property of terms in the above equation. The terms F^{‘\mu\nu}, \psi, and phi are all fields in the same way we speak of electric and magnetic fields. Namely, they take on various values at each point in space and time. However, in quantum field theory, these fields physically represent particles. This relationship is somewhat more subtle than I’m outlining here, but in the subsequent discussion whenever you see one of these field terms think “particle”

I’m going to give a short summary of each term before discussing the historical background to these terms. But in general the entire equation defines how *most* elementary particles in the world interact with each other. The equation and the set of concepts and definitions associated with it is termed “The Standard Model” as in “the standard accepted model of particle interactions.” 

The first term (the strange “F*F”) term is called the gauge field strength. It defines the properties of the forces between particles. Besides gravity, there are three well understood gauge forces of the physical universe. There is the electromagnetic force (which gives rise to electric and magnetic phenomena), there is the strong force (also known as the nuclear force), and the weak interaction (the ‘force’ responsible for radioactive decay). The F*F term on the mug represents all three of these interactions.

(Draw three diagrams: A hydrogen atom, a neutron undergoing beta decay, and a nucleus)

The second term the psiDpsi term is called the fermion kinetic term. (Fermion because it is only for fermions and kinetic because it describes dynamics) It defines how the electrons, neutrinos, quarks (and their anti particles) propagate through space time.

(Draw pictures of electrons, neutrinos, quarks moving through space time)

The psi y psi phi term is called the Yukawa interaction and defines how the higgs boson interacts with the fermions of the standard model. For example, this term gives rise to the masses of all electrons and quarks. It is named after the Japanese physicist Hideki Yukawa who postulated this term as an early model of how neutrons interact with protons. When we consider the energy potential created by this term we get something similar to a coulomb potential with an exponential damping

(Draw pictures of higgs interacting with fermions and an arrow saying “mass”; Also write the equation of the yukawa potential)

The |Dphi|^2 term is the boson kinetic term. This term is actually somewhat complicated, but for our purposes it how the higgs boson propagates through space time. The higgs boson is the most recently discovered particle of the standard model and was found at CERN in 2012.

(Draw a fat particle saying “I’m the higgs boson!”; “Actual LHC Data” with massive at 125 GeV peak))


The V(phi) term is the boson potential. In a way it is the main reason particles in the standard model have mass. The exact form of this potential leads to a phenomenon called spontaneous symmetry breaking. (SSB) This is just a fancy name for when the physical properties of a system don’t bear the original symmetries as the foundational mathematical formalism. In the standard model, it is primarily responsible for making the weak interaction have a shorter range of interaction than the electromagnetic interaction. Without symmetry breaking the weak interactions and the electromagnetic interaction would have the same strength and would be part of a single interacting field. 

(Write the potential V(phi) and an arrow stating SSB and then an arrow stating the interaction for radioactive decay is much weaker than the interaction for electromagnetism)


Things I didn’t talk about
h.c.

One thing I didn’t talk about was the “h.c.” term you see next to the i psi D psi and the psi y psy phi terms. This “h.c” stands for hermitian conjugate and it is for matrices and operators what the complex conjugate is for numbers. For example, a matrix which is added to its hermitian conjugate yields a new matrix with real eigenvalues. 

A + h.c (stands for hermitian conjugate of A) = M and M has real eigenvalues

This is important because real eigenvalues (unlike imaginary ones) can be related to physical quantities. The lagrangian is generally taken to be a real quantity in physics so terms in the lagrangian are made to be real by adding them to their hermitian conjugate. (The mug, however, has a mistake. The first “h.c.” next to the i psi D psi is not necessary because this term is already hermitian. The second “h.c.” is correct)

- Feynman diagrams 

Now for my favorite part: History!
There are a lot of famous physicists connected to the standard model. But I’ll just mention one

First comes Freeman Dyson. He left England after WWII to study physics in Cornell. He had only an undergraduate degree in mathematics, but he had taught himself enough physics so that while he was at Cornell he effectively worked as a post-doc. While there, he met Richard Feynman and learned about his unique approach to quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics, and was able to re-formulate Feynman’s work in a language which was understandable to contemporary physicists. Thus Dyson made Feynman’s powerful methods accessible to the masses! The quantum electrodynamics part in the cup is effectively contained in the terms (-1/4 Fmunu Fmunu + i psi D psi + psi y y phi)


Equation for quantum electrodynamics

Dyson is an interesting character because he has an atypical scientific biography. First, he began as a pure mathematician (studying number theory, I believe) and later became a mathematical physicist. Second, he never received a Ph. D and was very outspokenly against the entire doctorate process. Finally, in his later years he became a quite accomplished scientific writer. His book “Disturbing the Universe” is one of the first popular science/physics books I read.

Then there’s Abdus Salam. Abdus Salam was a Pakistani physicist, who left Pakistan while it was still a part of India. He studied in the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, which is where he received his doctorate, returned of Londonhe first Pakistani Nobel prize winner, which to be fair, must also 


Next, is Tomonaga. My western centered education prevents me from knowing too much about Tomonaga. 

Dyson, Tomonaga, and Salam

The first one, I’ll mention is Feynman. When Feynman was in graduate school he developed a new way to frame quantum mechanics (his Ph.D thesis is quite short and really readable. You should read it!) which he later applied to understanding the quantum properties of the electromagnetic field. This is called quantum electrodynamics QED, and, outside of Feynman diagrams, this is certainly what he’s most famous for. 

Schwinger taught himself most of the physics he knew and was so far advanced in his education that he was able to complete his Ph.D before he received his undergraduate degree from Columbia. It took him some time to start working on problems in quantum electrodynamics, but like Feynman, when he did he developed his own approach. But Schwinger’s approach was much less intuitive than Feynman’s and besides some specific mathematical concepts it is not as widely used anymore. 

Tomonoga was a Japanese physicist who was also working on

Knowing you’re a writer
Some time ago I paraphrased Junot Díaz (in a quote I can no longer find) and claimed that a person knows he is a writer when…

When you feel that everything you want to say has already been said and said better by other people and you say something anyway. 

I think this paraphrase was partly motivated by Helen Lee, the instructor in one of my short fiction workshops in 2013. She told the class one day that you could write and write, and then read Toni Morrison and feel that all your writing was for nothing because there is nothing else left to say. But you have to look at your writing and see something that is worth saying anyway. 

I still think this is true, but it is not as close to my experience as it could be. Instead what I typically find is that the things I want to say have not even been mentioned by other people. It is not merely that they exist in the space of existing ideas and are undervalued. It is that they do not exist at all and by relation seemingly have no value. It is within this space that one really must find the courage to write, and the writers we so respect today are people who had to come to terms with the decision of this courage. So I have a better description of how one knows one is a writer. 

When what you want to say has never been said because no one else seems to care about it, and you say it anyway.

Truth In Science vs. Everywhere else
What Kuhn did for science was to hold a mirror up to it and show that the thing which thought itself to be  horse in the midst of asses, was really just another ass. 

The thing is scientists like to believe in the objectivity of their discipline, and they believe this is a characteristic which separates science from most other human endeavors. Our businesses, our political systems, even our so humanistically necessary arts are governed and constrained by the often unjustified subscriptions to authority. These things define what is real and hence true according to consensus, conformity, and acceptance rather than a seemingly more absolute standard. Thus these are truths are really not all what we people believe them to be and which can therefore only disappoint. As so often occurs, we discover the systems we so blindly believed in and which we desperately thought would keep us safe and happy, have in fact nothing to do with individuals and are even independent of what is right—a rightness made true through internal consistency—in the world. 

Most people turn to science in order to escape such naked arbitrarity. Finding the human created world to lack the consistency it pretends, the sensitive woman looks for a stabilizer outside of bare humanity. But how unfortunate would it be to discover science bears the same deficiencies she sees in the rest of the world? How tragically ironic that because science is done by the same entities, namely people, that it is inevitably plagued by the same disease?

Because what Kuhn tells us is that science can only be called science if it is accepted by a community of so called scientists. Such a tautological definition seems inappropriate unless you ask certain questions. 
Why is it that capable and eminent scientists find it so difficult to accept new scientific theories? Why are scientific revolutions so recurrent and seemingly inevitable? And perhaps even most simply, what really distinguishes crackpots and amateur scientists from their professional counterparts? Answering the latter question, it is not merely training but is also their failure to operate within a tradition that most other scientists deem as correct. Thus, although nowadays it would be nearly blasphemous to even entertain the idea, in 1905 during Einstein’s miracle year it would have been quite appropriate to see his ideas on relativity as the manifestation of a previously capable mind finally going off the deep end. 

In short science is indeed subjective, and what scientists claim as true in science has as much relationship with the actual objective truth they seek as the laws of a country have to do with actual morality and justice. These abstract concepts certainly exists, but it seems that they insidiously slip our grasps when we try to define and codify them through the institutions we create.

Strange Dreams

	Another strange dream. This one initially presented itself to be a series of trials, but became something else entirely. I, with many other people, was in a dungeon like cavern. We were in a room in this cavern with pillars extending from the ground to the ceiling. A voice boomed from somewhere in the interior. It said things I can no longer remember, but soon afterwards the pillars began to fall and the ceiling began to crumble. Someone in our group—a figure who looked much like Batman—began deflecting the pillars somehow. When all the pillars were down, we were all somehow still alive. We fled the room and passed through many interior corridors. I was separated from the group and found myself alone in a room, made modern through its tiled walls and fluorescent lights. 

	A woman entered the room with a tray of food and sat down. I was initially hiding but the table behind which I was doing it was too small to hide anything, so I stood and sat down in front of her. She extended a hand in greeting and automatically I did the same, but before I had time to think of whether this was dangerous, a needled extended from her wrist and pierced my own. I got up and stumbled back. Was this an anesthetic? I crumbled to the ground. Sometime later when I looked back at the table, the woman was gone and in her place was an bespectacled man in shorts and a yellow shirt. I will from now on call him The Professor.

	The Professor told me to sit down where I was previously seated. Why should I do this? I thought to myself. It was clear now that I was within a space where my volition seemed to have little affect on the outcome, so if I were to be destroyed in such a space, why should I be a willing participant in my eventual destruction? So instead of returning to my seat, I pretended to still be groggy and sick. Somehow The Professor saw through this. He waited patiently for a beat and then he told me that I should sit when I was done whatever I was doing. At this I seemingly caved immediately: I got up from the floor and sat on the chair in front of the professor. 

	At this point The Professor gave me a test written on two sides of a 5 1/2 by 8 1/2 piece of paper. One side required me to write out some equations which modeled a process (the specific process now escapes my me). On the other side I was supposed to construct a poem starting from the last line and working my way backward. I was given a total of 10 minutes to do both. 

	I started on the first task and I wrote down some equations, but I ultimately could not “see” my way through them. I turned to the poem, but this too proved difficult. In frustration I pushed the paper away and placed both hands on either side of my head. 

	“I can’t do this. I can’t construct a sensible mathematical theory and write a coherent poem in 10 minutes.” 
	I was somewhat hysterical when I said it. I felt like a soldier, who upon failing to wound a strong enemy, lays down his weapons and kneels on the ground just to get his eventual defeat over with. The Professor nodded his head in understanding.
	“Would you be able to do it if I gave you a day, and you came back?” he asked. 
	Ah. A light. I looked up at him, and he continued.
	“I know about your work. It’s clearly formal, in a way, and I know that you’re not willing to kiss a lot of ass in order to get where you’re going. But I’m going to be the one to work with you. And I need to know you can do things like this.”

	This floored me, the way dreams can so quickly erase their initial terms of engagement, becoming something entirely different from what they presented themselves to be. It’s always been disconcerting, but even more strangely, this man seemingly knew “about me”. He knew that my work was formal but not mathematically rigorous, and he apparently knew I didn’t really like following orders. How did he know all this? His knowledge surprised me, but I was also mellowed. Perhaps he was a friend, not an enemy.  

I told him “OK, I’ll work on it over the day and get back to you”

He then got up and said he wanted to show me something. There was a straw looking microscope pointing into a jar. Looking into the jar I saw black shiny objects seemingly moving on their own. “Do you know what these are?” he asked almost as a way of a test. I thought a bit and said “Iron Sulfide” “Correct,” he said enthusiastically. But this was not so. When I woke up I checked what a compound with those properties was, and I saw it must have been a ferro fluid. But all characters in dreams, even those who are not ourselves, are limited by our own knowledge so perhaps it makes sense The Professor had the same misunderstanding I did. 

Of course this is, in a way, ironic. The Professor tells me I am independent and by relating a view of myself I find so positive, he convinces me to become dependent on him and his evaluation. This dream of course reflected my current preoccupations. How to find an advisor given that I have always come to hate the work I was assigned. How to get through graduate school. How, simply, to live a life. But this dream really is only a reflection, and thus keeps me within a world I created and can understand. Recent experiences have revealed such a world is not as clean of an approximation to the real world as I thought. Instead it is governed by delusions I believe in because I need to and not because they bring me closer to what is grandiosely called “true”. 

My previous lucid dream, led me to contact Hugo, an action with consequences as of now unforeseen. What will this dream lead me to do?

All of physics is in a way mathematical modeling. What is typically referred to as mathematical modeling concerns finding mathematical solutions to problems which exist in a visceral physical space we all occupy, but more generally the modeling which occurs in physics concerns finding mathematical representations of abstract but initially qualitative ideas. 

————-

Is my work a reflection of my cowardice in forming relationships? I always thought it existed in a separate space, a place I could engage with it without feeling I needed to deal with the things in life which were relationally difficult.

Finding Your Voice
It’s difficult to find your voice in writing (perhaps in any work). What inspires you initially and what gets you to sit down and do the work, is reading something written so well that it seemingly demands emulation. So you read Rand, and you write an essay on a topic she discusses in her book. Unsurprisingly, your language is much like her language, your cadence and choice of words resemble her own. It is difficult to get out of this mode, this way of writing which is really more like a parroting than speaking. It is not that there’s no intelligence behind it. It’s just that the intelligence is subdued and hiding. The reason it’s so difficult to escape the naked imitation is that you often confine yourself to the topics which initially inspired you. And the style in which these things were originally written is in a way an artifact of the topic itself. Moreover, finding such a clear example of good writing in the initial inspiring example, one is led, almost inevitably, to fall into repeating what one has read. 

The way out seems apparent. If the writing is in some way dependent on the content, then the reason you’re parroting the writing is because you’re parroting the content. Thus in order to find your voice, you need to write about things that you have never seen written about before. Such topics would not be so obscured by your sense of the correct way of writing, and thus you will be forced to create something new. This new thing you create, conveniently developed in a space rendered empty through your ignorance, is ultimately what you label as your voice. 

[//]

Emptiness
I want to talk about when the fire is gone, when the thing which so clearly inspired you and filled you with the need to work has left and is seemingly never coming back. 

When I am planning my work for the week, it is a state that I pretend does not exist, but of course it always finds me. Something (exhaustion, a road block, or a distraction) separates you from your work for a short amount of time and then all of a sudden you’re cut off. You were in a state where every mathematical or physical idea had manifest meaning and needed to be pursued and fleshed out for reasons you felt but did not understand. Then all of a sudden it is like you’ve been projected into a space devoid of all meaning. You look at your previous work and you feel not apathy, but disgust. You want to deal with anything but that work. 

And when you feel this way, you believe that it will continue forever. You think that you have always in a way hated the work you did and you always will. So beyond not being able to work, you feel life is less worthy of tolerance. 

I have moved into and out of the space enough times to at least have an experiential confidence in its impermanence. But, this is the first time I’m acknowledging that it perhaps is not an anomaly.

It is sad to live life passively believing or merely hoping that the state of the world will improve without your influence. But it is also sad to be trapped in the present, to think that the world as it exists now represents the world as it always will.

From Nobody Knows My Name “Faulkner and Desegregation”
Any real change implies the breakup of the world as one has always known it, the loss of all that gave one an identity, the end of safety. And at such a moment, unable to see and not daring to imagine what the future will now bring forth, one clings to what one knew, or thought one knew; to what one possessed or dreamed that one possessed. Yet, it is only when a man is able, without bitterness or self-pity, to surrender a dream he has long cherished or a privilege he has long possessed that he is set free—he has set himself free—for higher dreams, for greater privileges.

Hugo, Part II
I went out with Hugo Friday night. This is strange to write. A week and a half ago I was cursing myself for my inability to disentangle a fantasy from the world as it “truly” is. And yet here is a piece of the fantasy entering reality as if it always belonged. Because what made me contact Hugo in the first place was a dream, something pulled from my unconscious as a signal for conscious action. The dream itself, one can argue, was induced by reading Aciman’s book, an action deliberately chosen. But I cannot make the rigorous argument that I necessarily had to connect that book to my experience with Hugo. 

On Tuesday it had been five days since my last email to him. I was quite sure that he had received the subtle message in my previous email and had taken the typical route of avoiding an awkward exchange by simply refusing to continue it. In that last email the three movies I recommended that we watch were The Big Short, The Revenant, or Carol. The last movie was as direct a signal I was as willing to send at this moment, and after the subsequent weekend silence I thought he had intuited its meaning and was scared. Scared enough, perhaps, to never speak to me again. 

So the weekend and the days after were quite bad. Not to mention that Mush never texted. I was finally realizing something I had never admitted to myself about the world. It is not merely my relationships with women which are the problem. It is not that due to each party’s expectations—expectations inculcated over decades by parents, friends, sitcoms, and movies—male-female relationships are inherently fraught. They are indeed fraught, but looking at my male-male relationships both platonic and otherwise I’m forced to recognize it is not the gender binary which explains the dissonance. It is something perhaps intrinsic to human relationships, or to be less sweeping, intrinsic to me. There must be something I cannot hear, a frequency existing well beyond the range I can perceive, that makes me miss the signals and non-signals so necessary for the initiation and maintenance of any non-filial human connection. 

This was the story I was telling myself, when on Tuesday Hugo emailed me back. He had been on a ski trip and was just now getting back. He said The Big Short looked like an interesting film, and we should watch it this weekend. 

Had he understood what I meant by suggesting Carol and simply side stepped the issue by suggesting a more innocuous film? Or more likely, was there as much thought applied to the choice as someone choosing a piece of fruit in the produce aisle? Of course, these signals are only obvious to someone who lives in a world written in their language, only someone who constantly searches and inspects and dissects noise looking for some subtle tell of meaning could so clearly and easily see what I could mean by suggesting that film. And it is more telling of my myopia and insanity than of anything else that I would believe with an iron conviction that he could see precisely what I could see. 

The following email exchange was easier. I held back, feeling at any moment that it could all fall apart and I would have a weekend much like all other weekends. But we scheduled it, and I texted him on Friday, and he returned my text, and we did go out. 

It was strangely good to see him again. Something like exhaling. He had the same orange jacket I remembered from a year ago, and he had grown a beard. It is true what they say about how clothes really are irrelevant when someone really likes you. When I think about the way he looked I am led to use adjectives more grandiose and floral than anything he wore deserved. Which tells me, I was perhaps not really looking at what he wore. He told me I had a nice haircut, bringing me back to that moment a year and a half ago when he said the same thing. 

The movie was good. And no I was not so flustered that I remember nothing about it. But during the movie I did sit next to him in a kind of awe, not really of him, but simply of the fact that here I was “sitting next to him”. It suggests something about the nature of the relationship between fantasy and reality. As someone who spends so much time immersed in fantasy as a way to soothe the frustrations and anger so readily reaped from reality, I had always been convinced of the immiscibility of the two. You live in your head for a time, and the life constructed there can never ever appear on life’s true stage. And yet here was something I constructed in my mind, and even spurned myself for constructing, making itself real and true in the world. 

I cannot say something inspirational and thus hardly accurate about making dreams a reality and listening to some inner light only you can perceive. I also will not write this event off as a coincidence. But it seems agency mixing with the passive influences of dreams sometimes has a way of making those dreams manifest, even if only partially, in one’s actual life. 

And talking with him, I remembered the thing that I liked so much about him before: his voice. It’s so subdued and quiet, soothing in almost every way. A voice nothing like a woman’s but also nothing like the deep commanding voice I periodically adopt when speaking to strangers, i.e., not the voice America tells men they should have. The voice contains both kindness and softness, suggesting that the person to whom it belongs is someone it is OK to embrace.

Thinking about it, all the guys I’ve really liked had this quality about them. They seemed to exist in direct contrast to the pseudo-masculinity so pervasive in Western culture. They were not loud, they were not abrasive, not commanding. They were all classically ‘nice guys’, that pejorative used when women describe men who are polite and chivalrous and who they will never sleep with. Or so I like to think, because each of these guys (even Hugo right now) ended up with a girlfriend, a fact which I must say greatly improved my opinion of the female population. 

People don’t really know what love is because like all words in our world, it is something which first and foremost gains legitimacy by being defined and understood by other people. But love also gains the added complexity of being something we can only understand by experiencing it ourselves. So when deciding whether they are in love, people are caught in a contradiction which manifests in their unwillingness to label the thing they are so personally feeling with a word which has been so overused as to be on the verge of meaninglessness. But what one feels cannot be denied, and the denotative definition of love is indeed quite stable. Thus finding semblance between the two, most people simply succumb to the pressures of consensus and simply agree that what they are experiencing is indeed love. 

So, yes, I know what’s happening here. The last time I remember feeling this way was with Jessica. Something bubbling and frothing forth. An unconscious will compelling me to think constantly and warmly about this one person. I loved Jessica. I knew it was coming after the first time we danced. It wasn’t romantic; anything but, really. It was the first time I had danced in months, having placed self-imposed restrictions on such frivolity for my entire term as pledge trainer. But on the night of the winter formal, all the pledges had officially become brothers and the so carefully maintained facade could at last be peeled away. Ignition by R. Kelly was, I think, the song which marked my re-entrance to my hidden identity. Jessica danced with me, seemingly sharing in my joy at no longer having to pretend. 

After the movie, we took the T back to Harvard square and we walked to Harvard stadium. The 86 was coming down the street, and I decided to run for it. I told him goodbye and he told me we should hang out again. It’s what everyone says after an outing like this, but I wanted to believe it was sincere. The bus had stopped a hundred yards in front of us so it took me a good ten seconds before I reached it. When I got on, I thanked the bus driver for waiting and I met the annoyed faces of riders who had been waiting for the seemingly invisible passenger to arrive. 

But for some reason, at this moment, I did not care. I had just left Hugo, and he was smiling when I departed, so something was telling me that whatever messages in my current environment to the contrary I was OK and fine in this world. 

And this feeling I realized could be expanded and extrapolated. Either rightly or wrongly, I believed that if Hugo felt for me the things I felt for him, then I wouldn’t really care what anyone else thought of me. I wouldn’t need to try to impress authority figures. I wouldn’t be so constantly immersed in that hum of anxiety and apprehension which I find in any space of 20 or more people. I would have already proven myself to the only person that mattered, and so nothing else would need to be proven.

This feeling is dangerous. It’s what ultimately ended my friendship with Stephan: my selfish inability to preserve the relationship I had by simply letting go of the relationship I wanted. And so in spite of everything in me pulling for it, I am reluctant to see him again. Because if we kept seeing each other, and we kept talking, then we would become closer over time. Eventually, I would become so close to him, that I would think it would be OK to tell him how I feel. Tell him not merely because I expected my feelings to be reciprocated, but because we would be in a mode of such naked self expression that I would think it safe to be so honest. So I would tell him, and because he wouldn’t feel the same way and more importantly would have no idea how to deal with a guy who feels that way about him, the friendship would end. It would all disappear because I couldn’t let go of a fantasy. 

You reader of the future know how all of this ends, so I wrote this as much for your understanding as for my own. Perhaps, knowing what you know you can look at my apprehension with more clarity than I can, and can thus see better the best resolution to the situation I laid out. Or maybe, since you are disconnected from the immediate agency which gives this apprehension its only legitimacy, you are in truth unable to really understand anything about this situation and will only abstract away a lesson made irrelevant because it is made while you are comfortable and unafraid. Because no matter how unsure I am, what is true is the fact of the uncertainty and the fact that even if I make a mistake I, right now, am dealing with it. Regardless of your perspective on my decision, you, safely displaced from these events by time and space, really have no bench from which to judge.

January 25, 2016 — 6pm Monday
The Loss of Executive Control
I have just moved out a breakdown. I’d say it started Friday night after I watched the movie with Hugo, which means it lasted roughly 70 hours. It featured me consuming an entire (not an exaggeration) tin of Royal Danish cookies, two Reeses pieces candy, and 2/3 of a carton of oatmeal cookies. I didn’t shower or brush my teeth for two days, and for those two days I did not leave the house. This is not the first time this has happened. It has occurred at least a dozen times ever since the start of 2015. I remember having a two month episode in 2014, and I know I experienced it intermittently during the summer of 2012. This is the second time it’s occurring this year. I thought the anti-depressants would stop these episodes, but they haven’t really done anything. In fact, I’m currently hard pressed to see how the anti depressants are working at all. 

The main feature of the breakdown was a loss of executive control. Willpower was made irrelevant as all my actions seemed to become dictated by unconscious drives for gratification. There was of course the diminished sense of meaning in all activities, and perhaps this contributed to the inability to engage in such activities, but all of a sudden it was like the mass of the earth had doubled and it now required twice as much effort to move around and do anything. I managed to write some things (which is quite strange), but I did no physics. 

What caused this? Accumulated exhaustion perhaps. Wednesday through Friday of last week I woke up at 9am each day in order to attend a personal finance seminar. I didn’t always go to sleep early in order to attend these functions, so I was often tired in the afternoon the next day. Perhaps I was more tired than I realized. 

I do not think it was my interaction with Hugo which exhausted me; quite the contrary in fact. The morning after I went out with Hugo, I wrote for nearly three hours straight. But later that day Peter came over, and we talked for a time. Strangely, I think this made me more tired, depleting that thing I call psychological energy, the source of all creative work and impulse control. Although I was somewhat tired Saturday morning, I was still hopeful. It was only Saturday night, after Peter had left that I felt shitty about myself. 

Maybe it was the conversation topic. Peter talked about his problems with the girls in his life. The oh so fucking many girls. I have never realized it really bothered me until now, but Peter is somewhat insensitive in how freely he talks about these things with me. He thinks we are really good friends, which I suppose is justified. He doesn’t know the level of my friendships with other people, and I certainly talk with him in a way which is free. But I don’t tell him everything about myself; I don’t tell him the personal secrets which usually create the intimacy of such good friendships. I still don’t completely trust him. At one point he asked me if our friendship had truly recovered since the incident with Lesley. I told him that our relationship could never be what it was before the incident, but it was certainly better than what it was right after. Peter said this answer was ambiguous, and I must agree that it is, but I couldn’t add to it. It was certainly an answer more generous than I thought I would ever provide. 

But the women, Peter’s women. They all seem so incredibly infatuated with him. He told me about Tinsa who had become jealous after seeing Facebook pictures of Peter and his ex-girlfriend Tiffany. He broke up with Tinsa (the fourth or third time they’ve done so) in supposed reaction to Tinsa’s jealousy and he ironically began talking to Tiffany after they broke up. The day he met me he had just come from a multi-day retreat with Tiffany. She had told him she still loved him and that she had never gotten over him. She had even claimed one of his sweaters when he left, supposedly as a memento by which to remember him. While Peter and I spoke, I noticed a watch on his hand. It was an iWatch. He told me Tinsa sent it to him a few weeks ago, that is, a month and a half after they broke up. Dear reader, if you do not understand why a girl would send her ex-boyfriend an expensive gift a month and a half after he broke up with her, you and I are in the same camp. Peter couldn’t explain it very well himself. Supposedly he had gotten her a Christmas gift and this was simply her belated attempt to return the favor. 

Perhaps the reason I am so reluctant to call myself gay is not out of any attachment to the women I had in my life, but out of attachment to all the pain they’d caused. It is out of self righteousness, not out of love. I do not want to delegitimize the weeks and months of frustration and anger by labeling the preceding infatuations as simply a phase. The pain was real enough, so any sexual narrative to the contrary is certainly a narrative which cannot account for my own understanding of my life. 

And thus seeing Peter’s relationships with women displayed so clearly in relief to my own, I could not help but feel an unarticulated sense of injustice incurred again. Peter I have to say is a good looking guy, and I’m sure if I knew nothing of his personality and I simply saw him in the street I would think he was even more so. But the problem is I do know something, arguably a lot, about his character and when I look at Peter the external aspects of his experience are conflated with what I know of his personality and he takes on a look of at most average attractiveness. Because although Peter is much more externally attractive than I am, I am strangely not intimidated by him, because character wise I think I am a better person. And the shear extent of his success with women, although not perplexing to me, has always been a damning statement of women. In the past it has served as a justification of my vague and nonspecific hatred of them. 

But of course, this is unfair. Peter is a particular type of guy, and it is only a particular type of woman who is attracted to him. I think Lesley was really the first and the last girl we were both attracted to and that was at a time when I was less able to evaluate the characters’ of the women I was interested in (let’s not pretend you’re currently much better at doing so). 

I did not expect to go on to such a diatribe. My apologies. Let’s get back to the topic at hand:

The depletion of psychological energy with led to a loss of executive control was preceded as is typical by intensive uncomfortable social engagement. My hypothesis is that the social engagement required such a high level of personal cognitive monitoring that I found it difficult to exert further executive control in subsequent environments. This has occurred many times in the past after parties or generally any social get together when I have to engage with three or more relative strangers. I would attend the party one night, and feel depleted for at least 48 hours afterwards. The depletion would feature indolence, binge eating and tv watching, and a complete inability to work or even see any point in working. 

Another cause of a sudden loss of executive control is having my personal evaluation of my life conflict so clearly with an experience that others claim is the norm or is correct. This occurred, for example when I read Woodson’s initial remarks in The Miseducation of the Negro, and occurs more generally when I read news articles, blogs, or imprecisely written books. 

Also, I must say trying and failing to engage socially with other people is a large trigger for these episodes. I remember one episode beginning after Gbemisola promised (but failed to) contact me one weekend we were supposed to go out. The episode this past week (and even a week ago) was certainly partly precipitated by the fact that Mush still hadn’t contacted me. The episode last weekend certainly was exacerbated by Hugo’s apparent absence as well.

For this latter case what’s the lesson here? People are unreliable? You’re too sensitive?

Finally, constantly checking my email or text messages and finding that people who I expected to contact me were not doing so, did not positively contribute to my mental health. This is the main reason I cannot have a Facebook. 

Where does binge TV-watching fit into this picture? I’ve certainly seen both sides. Most often it leads me into a depressive episode and works effectively to keep me there. But sometimes, by giving me time away from the constant application of executive control it helps me move out of an episode. I don’t want this ambiguity in end effects to translate into an ambiguity in application of correctives which will just lead me to repeat this cycle again. A hard line position is that I should not engage in binge tv watching, but this point is moot because by the time executive control is lost, I really cannot direct myself to do anything. 

In most cases, sleep had been the last step in emerging from such an episode. It seemed to act both as a restoration and a reset. Which begs the question, was the episode really just a late consequence of sleep deprivation?

This loss of executive control is quite dangerous. You just ended a wintersession period where you had not external academic obligations, but if you were taking classes this would be much more difficult to manage. Moreover, simply for yourself, it will be impossible to accomplish any of the goals you want to accomplish if these episodes continue to occur. 

So at the cost of further learning about these episodes, we certainly want to prevent them from occurring again. 

What are the prescriptions?
Keep monitoring under what conditions these episodes occur. Write another entry (in this document) when you experience another one. 
These episodes are brought on by 
Intensive superficial social involvement
Long periods of cognitive control
Sleep deprivation
Binge TV watching
Email checking 
Alienation from work 
Feelings of inadequacy (from social rejection, external or internal narratives which suggest the inadequacy)

Prescriptions to avoid episodes
Sufficient sleep (maintained by having an internet curfew and not taking ludicrously early classes)
Email checking schedule
Taking a Shower
Periodically turning off phone
Only taking part in absolutely desired social activities 
Not exclusively doing physics work
Reading books (reading James Baldwin)
Writing
Exercising

I am a student who wishes to take Phys 247r this semester. Due to schedule conflicts I had to miss the first class. Was this first meeting a sign in meeting, and am I now ineligible to take the class because I missed it? Also, does the class require one to have a partner before hand?

Best,
Mobolaji

Model of thermally distributed permutations
In my second model of thermally distributed permutations, I found that the partition function can in some way be written to include the catalan numbers. Which, you know, is kind of interesting. This is my guess anyway, I still need to check this numerically somehow. 

Also perusing through my notes I realized that the catalan numbers appear in another physics context. They are the moments of a random GOE matrix, whatever that means.

Perturbation Diagrams in Quantum Mechanics


Quantum field theory is becoming increasingly popular as a field of physics. It has moved from the rarefied realm of condensed matter and particle physics to a subject that all physicists want to know about. It has seemingly re

Like quantum mechanics in the mid 20th century, it was originally the provisional subject of subatomic and solid state theorists and is on the verge of entering the mainstream of physics not merely because it is a physically interesting subject, but also because it’s general methodology seems to be ubiquitous. Renormalization group techniques and symmetry breaking phenomena have a relevance not at all constrained by their formulations in field theory and as such many physicists have felt the need to obtain a basic quantitative understanding of quantum field theory to supplement the qualitative one provided by popular physics texts. 

Perturbation theory is a technique found in virtually all areas of physics, but only in quantum field theory is perturbation theory placed in the diagrammatic context which lends it deep theoretical power. The diagrammatic interpretation of elements in a perturbation series have led to an understanding between the relationship of large N gauge theories and string theories, and ???. 

Perhaps the best introduction to these diagrammatic perturbation theory is provided in an elementary physics course or by Griffiths [1], but it’s possible to give students a taste of employing diagrams to understand and organize perturbation elements earlier in their studies. 

The purpose of this paper is to provide such an introduction. 

The ubiquity of quantum field theory arises from the fact that 

A rash of books () in the past decade have revealed there is increased demand in the physics community for an understanding of quantum field theory. 


Griffiths paper, Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted Amateur, some other paper on quantum field theory. 


The semblance between statistical field theory, condensed matter field theory, and quantum field theory suggests the general set of methods which can be employed in all these subjects are applied to systems where


there is a specific uncertainty
there is a nontrivial equilibrium configuration 


It is not novel to view the mathematics of quantum field theory as akin to the calculus of the 17th century. Both were initially developed within a specifically physical context—particle physics for the former and mechanics for the latter—and both were found to embody(/model) a (physical) framework much more general than their beginnings suggested. In order to abstract the mathematical underpinnings of the theory from the physical framework in which it was originally developed, it’s necessary to understand what features of the system make it amenable to the mathematical analysis applied to it. 

In the case of mechanics and calculus, the key fact is that in studying the properties of dynamical systems we are trying to understand how positions, angles, etc. change in time given what we know about how various changes in the Lagrangian relate to each other. In this case the key phrase is change and thus the mathematics which emerges from mechanics is quite simply a mathematics concerned with how functions change. From this mathematics of change we obtain 

In quantum field theory, statistical field theory, and condensed matter field theory, the we are trying to compute the field moments of various . In essence we’re dealing with probability density functionals and the mathematics is modeling systems which are defined according to an equilibrium, which have some uncertainty and which deviate from that equilibrium. 

is the mathematics of random functions. Random functions have probability densities defined by functionals and we normalize these functionals by integrating over probability space.

From Nobody Knows My Name “Faulkner and Desegregation”
“Any real change implies the breakup of the world as one has always known it, the loss of all that gave one an identity, the end of safety. And at such a moment, unable to see and not daring to imagine what the future will now bring forth, one clings to what one knew, or thought one knew; to what one possessed or dreamed that one possessed. Yet, it is only when a man is able, without bitterness or self-pity, to surrender a dream he has long cherished or a privilege he has long possessed that he is set free—he has set himself free—for higher dreams, for greater privileges.”

Baldwin is ever talking about change and the dangers it poses. Dangers people suffer not because there is anything inherently fatal about change, but merely because people hold tightly to who they once were. At the precipice of the transformation, people must let go of a past self and deal with the uncertainty of meeting a new self. It is the uncertainty which is frightening, not merely the fact that we must ask the question but also that we do not have the answer concerning who we are. In truth, this transformed self always existed in part within us, because although circumstances might call it forth, it emerges from us. Thus the new self we fear is a part of our being we seldom acknowledged in the past either out of indolence or an inability to fit that self in the narrative by which we understood our lives. Its emergence leads us to connect with parts of ourselves we previously ignored and consequently can lead to a larger definition of self.

But I do not necessarily agree with Baldwin that when one lets go of a delusion he then ultimately sets himself up for an enlightenment which is life-expanding. These delusions exist for a reason and we are attached to them because we recognize that if they were not there, we would be susceptible to being destroyed by truths we are not yet prepared to handle. The truth grants freedom but it can also blind and disfigure those not ready to receive it.

Bisexual Straw man argument practice

(I’m distilling some arguments from Kenji Yoshino’s pretty incredible piece on bisexual erasure)

The relative distrust straight people have of bisexuals in comparison to gay people is really just a manifestation of veiled homophobia. According to the standard sexual identity narrative, people are either born straight or gay. This allows people who identify as straight—and there are certainly ways they can legitimize that identity—to maintain a solid and largely incontestable position at the top of a sexual identity hierarchy. This also allows gay people to hold fast to the argument that indeed their sexual identity was not of their choosing and so discrimination against them is immoral*. 

But when bisexuality becomes an option, namely you make it possible for formerly identified straight people to be attracted to people of the same sex or formerly identified gay people to be attracted to people of a different sex, then indeed it becomes possible for gay people in effect to choose between two sexes they are attracted to and it becomes possible for straight people themselves to lose their privileged heterosexual identity simply through any manifestation of same sex attraction. 

Thus what straight people see in bisexuals—and this is the primary reason of the distrust—is a premonition of their own fallen status. And what gay people see (or partly see anyway**) in bisexuals is a need to reinterpret their own sexual identities and a rewriting of the narratives by which they understand their lives.

* This was always a terrible argument because it is subtly homophobic. It essentially seems like a capitulation to the heterosexual understanding of homosexuality. It’s like gay people are saying “Yes we know what we’re doing is wrong, but hey we didn’t choose to be this way so just like you can’t discriminate against race and sex you can’t discriminate against us.” But discrimination against gay people is wrong, not because they didn’t choose to be gay—for there are subtleties even in this claim—but because there is nothing wrong with a man falling in love with another man or a woman falling in love with a woman. You might as well discriminate against people who choose to read 18th century spy novels. You might not understand why they’re doing it, but just because you find it distasteful doesn’t mean it actually is. 

** I have come to understand that there are experiential reasons for gay people’s distrust of bisexuals. Some gay people believe bisexuality is a fabricated sexual identity which allows people to engage in same sex relationships without the committing to a lower status sexual identity. (Lesbian until graduation, for example). Others see it as a transition period for people who will later identify as gay. 

Personal Comment: I really think this sexuality binary is really only good for stupid people who can’t handle the contradictions between the way they understand their lives and the understanding the world imposes upon them. So yea, let them have it it makes them live their lives better. 
(You’re going to eat these words in a few years)

—

Bisexual is what gay and straight people use to describe people who refuse to define themselves according to their sexual identity. And I don’t think it’s a coincidence that (in English at least) while “gay” and “straight” are terms referring to a sexual identity, there is no reference to sex (the act) in either word thus creating a space for these identities to be seen as romantic or emotional as well. “Bisexual” however is explicitly sexual, which implicitly suggests that those who adopt that identity—or in reality those have that identity foisted upon them by a monosexual framing—are primarily more sex centered than their monosexual counterparts. This of course is incredibly ironic: A monosexual culture unable to parse an identity which denies the legitimacy of monosexuality then claims said identity is more “sex-obsessed” than the culture which itself made sex the focus. 
[//]

It’s like I was living in a world where people decided around the age of 18 that they like blue pens or red pens (but not both), and subsequently went around defining themselves and other people according to which pens they liked. And my thing is that pens—especially their color—aren’t really that important to me so why does it matter? Or more precisely, why do I have to define myself according to something which is extremely important for other peoples’ identities, for whatever reason, but really isn’t all that important to my own?

The Primacy of Sex
Yoshino has an interesting argument concerning the real possibility of ending sex-based discrimination. In a section in which he outlines why straight people are invested in erasing bisexuals, he states that they have an interest in doing so in order to stabilize the primacy of sex as a defining human characteristic. He points to the unstated contradiction with how society suggests we manage our relationship to sex (as in male or female) in our professional vs. our private lives. Privately we are encouraged to discriminate on the basis of sex in finding sexual and life partners. Namely, society is heteronormative: males are encouraged to seek out female partners and females are encouraged to seek out male partners. But in public spheres, namely in professional settings, society nowadays makes it illegal to evaluate people according to their sex. 
	Yoshino argues that this division although legally mandated is difficult to implement in practice. This makes sense to me. If you view people of type A as potential sexual and life partners while viewing people of type B as precluded from such relationships, surely you cannot expect that you will treat type A and type B equally in certain professional contexts simply because the law requires you to. In this way Yoshino goes even further to argue that bisexuals (and asexuals) should in fact be favored in a society which seeks to eliminate sexual discrimination in public spheres.

Symptoms of a Loss of Executive Control
A loss of executive control refers to the state where the individual is fully conscious but does not have the ability to exercise his will to complete cognitively demanding tasks. It is important to state that the individual is fully conscious seeing as the ability to complete cognitive tasks diminishes at the precipice of the sleep cycle as well. 

Here are the symptoms I observe in myself for a loss in executive control
Untidy surrounds (desk with used plates and utensils, unorganized books on desk, bed filled with clothes and books, clothes thrown on floor)
Binge eating (in ability to control quantity and kind of food consumed)
Aimless internet surfing 
Binge TV watching (watching two or more hours of television in a row)
Excessive napping
Deep sense of futility
Loneliness
Feeling of abject worthlessness
Inability to plan into the future
Excessive porn watching
Compulsive gum chewing

These symptoms also act as warning signs. Identifying them early can help prevent a slip into an episode of the loss.

“I have developed a concept of identity consonance and dissonance that I explored through my field research. I use these terms to describe the experience of acquiring a new identity, and how it feels when the new identity blends smoothly with other personal identities versus how it feels when they clash… While identity-consonant students incorporate their new professional identity smoothly and nonconsciously, identity-dissonant students experience an identity crisis that may cause them to feel uncertain about their values, ambitions, abilities, affinities, and their very self-worth.” 

Chapter 2 of Professional Identity Crisis by Cary Costello Gabriel

Is this what was happening to me three years ago? Is this what is still happening now? Do I find my personal identity conflicting with the identity I was to assume upon entering graduate school, or at least conflicting with the identity options I felt were available to me? 

There is a very self serving way to pose this dissonance. Graduate school at least initially largely perpetuates the “learning through scrupulous obedience” model of education employed in high school and college. And this is all well and good for subjects I do not have an emotional attachment to, but I seem patently unable to find the motivation to follow the requests of authority within physics. Thus, the independent and personally affected approach I used when studying physics conflicted with the apprentice-master relationship of graduate school. I was an identity dissonant student, because I was simply too independent and realizing this on some level I questioned whether I should even go to graduate school and later I began to question my abilities in physics and even my self worth. 

This is the story right? Except if you were really as independent as you claim to be, wouldn’t you be able to better direct your education as you see fit? Would there be all this floundering?

January 31, 2016 - Sunday 5:48 PM
What we know about people is that they are sufficiently complex that they can sustain non-platonic relationships which have no biological purpose i.e. no purpose connected to reproduction. Is the line between platonic relationships and sexual relationships so clear that we can’t imagine a relationship toeing that line or slipping from one side of it to the other?

Du Bois spoke of double consciousness as though it was an exclusively racial phenomena, but it is really much more general. It comes from recognizing your internal and experientially gained understanding of the world is not merely different from but wider than the understanding other people ostensibly have of your life; that while you may see yourself as an individual others often see you as a caricature. And this dissonance is problematic because any sort of effective communication between two people requires that each person, for a time, engage with the world that the other person believes exists. So if you are trying to establish some relationship with a person, or more widely with a culture, and that person sees you in a way diametrically opposed to the way you see yourself, however you react you are inevitably forced to engage in a sort of mental gymnastics. You can subdue the identity you recognized and cultivated for most of your life in order to create a short-lived communion by momentarily accepting the one foisted upon you. In other words, you can play the role they expect of you in exchange for some other ends or in exchange for that common substitute for personal identity—a peer acceptance which seems like intimacy but is really extortion*. Or you superficially contend with their version of you while trying your best to explain to them that it is incorrect or certainly is more reflective of them than of you. 

Or of course you can disengage entirely, leaving neither you nor them changed, but strangely leaving both people quite bitter for it. 

The story is that white heterosexual males do not have to suffer such double consciousness, but I doubt this is true. Each of those categorizations, white and heterosexual, is connected to caricatures that are true only in narrative and not to life and thus which thereby create the same type of a double consciousness felt by the more traditional minorities. It is not politically correct to say the privileged are afflicted by the same psychological disease they apparently forced upon the less privileged, but it is nonetheless true. And this reveals that at the core, there is something at issue with political correctness. For if we are to abide by what it tells us, we are required to filter reality through a lens of propriety. We ask not whether what we say is logical or connected at all with whatever we observe in the world. Instead we ask if what we say fits with what our social environment deems is acceptable to say. 

So we have a situation where it is no longer politically correct for black people to feel they have to live within the narratives white people construct about their lives, but it is perfectly politically correct for people who do not identify as explicitly straight or explicitly gay, perhaps people who don’t sexually identify themselves at all, to have their lives categorized and explained by people who simply do not share their experiences. 

* I call it blackmail because the other person by only engaging with you if you relinquish part of your identity is essentially demanding you confirm his view of the world before he gives you acceptance

Meeting with Matt Reece
I met with Professor Reece on Wednesday. The meeting was a good one. It seems most of our meetings are good. But during the meeting a point of slight embarrassment for me came up. Professor Reece asked if I had any expectations to take any qualifiers sometime soon. In too many words I told him no and then explained that although I was working with Amir, I was not formally going to become his student. He asked if I had plans for working with someone else, and I became even more hesitant. I fumbled an answer I had been planning most of the week. I talked about the time I worked with Jesse Thaler and my experiences with him. I mentioned that I was assigned many projects but I found all of them, including my thesis, difficult to complete. I said the “follow the leader” style of these projects where the advisor would tell the advisee what to do felt sort of empty to me, and without a holistic sense of the project, or more profoundly, disagreeing with the philosophy underlying the holistic sense I could intuit, I always became demotivated with these projects. 

Reece's response was interesting. All of this background exposition was geared towards preparing for my final claim that I would only feel motivated to work on projects I have some large degree of control over. But I never even got to the topic. Instead, Reece answered a question I didn’t really ask but which was illuminating nonetheless. 

He said when he was a grad student he often felt frustrated because he didn’t have the sense that he was solving really interesting problems. At times he had tried to think of rather “big” problems to solve, but he couldn’t ever make good progress on these problems. He then explained that it took him some time to be able to appreciate completing a solid and clear albeit unexciting investigation, and that what Jesse was trying to do by giving me the problems he was giving me was to allow me to experience that appreciation. Moreover, in recent years he said he discovered that the problems he solved in the past, problems he originally thought were pedestrian and not at all interesting, often proved to be relevant, even crucial, in his work on more interesting problems in the present. 

It was gratifying to hear this. Of course my real contention with my research during undergrad was not really the scientific implication scale of the problems, but the supersymmetric phenomenological backbone to them. Namely, I wasn’t absolutely concerned with the fact that the problems were concrete and “small”, so to speak, but I did care that they all assumed supersymmetry, which I was having less and less confidence in, was a true symmetry of nature.

In any case, it was good to hear from Reece a confirmation of something I have only recently learned. Indeed, I had been in a way obsessed with “large” problems for a time. This was back when my notion of problem solving and problem formulating in physics was rather naive, and I thought I had a good idea of how to do the former but because I couldn’t really do the latter, all aspects of my engagement with problems were inadequate. I had believed good problems could be formulated off the bat by intelligently parsing whatever current knowledge one has in a subject. But working on my models of monetary inflation and the thermal distribution of permutations model, I’ve realized good work can have really humble beginnings. In other words, in the same way solutions to problems must often be constructed in time and do not automatically appear at once, the best formulation of a problem, that is, the best way to elucidate a confusion, takes time and concrete inputs of effort to develop. 

This is my interpretation of what Reece was trying to tell me when he said I should appreciate the concrete but perhaps not hugely ground breaking pieces of work I can accomplish now. Perhaps, he was telling me something else however and I only filtered what was relevant to my own life experiences.

Scientific Papers vs. Scientific Letters
Taken from Phys191r course description “Science publications either fall in the category of scientific papers which are 10-15 pages long and present  a complete and detailed discussion of results versus scientific letters which are 3-4 pages and are for rapid communication of main results.” 


February 2, 2016- 1:14 AM Tuesday
Scientific Communication
I was reading a book today and I was surprised to feel annoyed when the author explained something I thought was obvious. The book was called The Career Game and it was by an economist. In one chapter he was discussing work life balance, and he said that if you get paid on salary and you work eight hours a day then after your work day, you have about five hours of leisure to yourself. Thus, he explains, if you decide to work over time for an hour you cut your leisure time down to four hours. Finally, the author mentioned that he showed in a figure on a nearby page how working over time for an hour reduced your leisure time by 20%. 

It was this last point that I thought was unnecessary. I thought this “reduction by 20%” was more or less established by the previous sentence and hence no further explanation was necessary. The fact that he was providing additional explanation suggested that he believed the point could be confusing, and the fact that he believed this made me question the general triviality of the book. Actually, I didn’t question the triviality; I reflexively assumed it. 

This made me self conscious and suspicious. Self conscious because I wondered if in my own scientific work I may find myself explaining something that someone with more experience would think is obvious and thus my work would be devalued as a result. But I also became suspicious because I realized this sentiment had a mirror image which might explain why scientific writing was so impenetrable at times. 

Because what truly clear writing achieves is to make something which is complicated appear natural and intuitive. But in the same vein, poor writing can make something which is simple seem complicated and nontrivial. Triviality is the bane of any scientific work, but true triviality is perhaps difficult to discern until the dust has settled and one has a sense of what new work follows one’s current work. However, to protect against event the appearance of triviality it seems that academics have an incentive to couch their work in a language which makes it seem anything but trivial. Thus they write unclearly and without any attempt to foster understanding in the reader, and their work as a result seems more complex and significant than it really is. 

This is a cynical perspective. Perhaps these academic, just don’t really know how to write. Or maybe it’s a combination of multiple factors. 

There is a positive corollary to this. The papers I really like, some of which are highly cited, are all quite well written. I’m thinking of Witten’s paper on Large N QCD/Limits on massless particles and Feynman’s paper on the spacetime approach to quantum mechanics. So this leads me to believe two, not necessarily mutually exclusive things. Either these people had value systems which extended beyond impressing their contemporaries with seemingly complicated work. Or because their work actually represented a meaningful development in physics there was no need to use obfuscating language to lend it a false significance. I am comfortable with both of these prospects, as they are quite inspiring. 

[//]

My Self Consciousness
There was a time when I was extremely, fatally self conscious. It wasn’t really that long ago, and maybe that time is now. But now, I see something else besides the fact of my self consciousness; I see the source and reason for it. And this source seems to make those experiences which form the bedrock of this mental illness all the more tragic. 

I would walk amongst people and I would feel their eyes upon me. Everywhere I go, I felt as though I was being watched. Was this the premonition of schizophrenia? No, I think it was narcissism. And loneliness. For, what I have realized lately is that I am very lonely and I have been so for years. Years and years of solitude moving into itself and moving out again. Washing me onto the shore for some momentary breaths of clean desalinated air, before the tide returns and drags me back to the black silent sea. I said before it was a screaming silence, and I say it was screaming because, like a siren, the emotional vacuum created in these moments of silence were warnings of crashes to come. The crashes came, of course they did, and they went away for long enough for me to believe they would never again occur at which point they happened again and again. 

Anyway, the point is I think I am so self conscious because I am so lonely. The loneliness makes me unconsciously open to all people because something in me tells me any new person I meet can be the life vest to save me from drowning. Thus every person’s opinion matters, and every judgment they have of me gains a validity not at all in proportion to the depth of the reasoning of that judgment, not at all in proportion to the depth of my relationship with them—because of course this relationship does not exist. 

And the tragedy is that in spite of this self consciousness and this implicit openness, the loneliness has remained. I haven’t achieved what our culture sees as the pinnacle of intimacy between people, but notwithstanding that seeming impossibility I feel that I haven’t achieved even more reasonable goals. 

Is this too self-patronizing? Placing myself as the victim of my life story, so that my pain is seen as more important than anyone else’s? It’s childish I know.

[//]

Complacency and Hypocrisy
I think I have at last determined why I hated how most women approached dating and courtship. It wasn’t that their approach seemed to be a giant contradiction to the feminist movement for gender equality in all social spheres; it was the hypocrisy in which this approach was enacted. 

There is a complacency in the way women approach dating. This complacency arises from the fact that women typically are pursued by—and hence do not have to pursue—men. This in turn allows women to establish relationships by passively waiting for suitors to engage with them. For a time, I accepted my role in this process, but over years engaging within it caused me to develop a fine hatred for a certain type of woman. This was the type of woman who was extremely callous in her rejection of men, a woman who communicated disdain and disapproval at the mere fact that a certain guy would have the gaul to try to talk to her and ask her out. These were the women who simply turned away when you tried to speak with them. 

I soon learned to become a bigot in these matters. It became easy, too easy, to pick these women out of a crowd simply by the way they walked or by the way they spoke to their friends. And soon it was easy for me to walk through Boston seeing whole swaths of people I simultaneously hated and virtually knew nothing about. 

But the reason for the hatred has become clearer to me now. It is the same hatred most people have for bullies for one knows that if the bully were the one being bullied, he would cry with a deeper and more pitiful self righteousness than the cries of his own victims. In these women I recognize a gratuitous callousness, one that they dish out because social norms don’t levy a cost on them if they do. But if they ever decided to step outside of their comfortable passive status and engaged with a man they were interested in, it’s clear that these women would not be able to take their own medicine. 


Bolaji. You sound crazy.

I finished finals on December 3 last year. A week later me and my friends had a christmas party. I left campus on December 19th. I took a flight of four hours to reach New orleans. 

In New Orleans, I celebrated Christmas and New Years Ever with my family. My father made chicken and my mother bought presents for my sister and I. 

I returned to campus on January 5, 2016

Sensitivity 
If all of my friends and acquaintances felt the way I did or experienced the world as I experienced it, Christine would never have started to ignore me after I told her I liked her, Peter would never have fucked Lesley five inches from my bed, Jessica would never had made out with Makai in plain sight of everyone, and texts I sent to friends or would-be-friends would never have been ignored.

But of course all these things did happen, so I am now forced to conclude that my reaction to the world is not the same as that of others. It is not merely that what I see in the world is different; it is that I feel differently about what I see. 

I imagine it would be similar to being one of the few people in a society who feels pain when a part of their arm is pressed. You’d go around tiptoeing around everyone, making sure not to press too hard on that particular vulnerability, while everyone else would go around, seemingly bumbling about, constantly hitting each other in that spot you find so sensitive. You would have no idea why they’re doing something so callous, and so with no better explanation to buttress it, you of course conclude that they are that callous. The world then takes on a darker hue, for if everyone who does not respond to the world with the same care and sensitivity that you do is deemed callous, then you inevitably find yourself beleaguered like the main character of I am Legend by beings whom you cannot fully identify as human. 

You’re good because you’re kind and conscientious. Most people are bad because they are not. It is a convenient narrative. But it is perhaps this convenience which should have made your realize it was suspect. Because if you really walk around being careful of who you hurt, making sure you don’t inadvertently jostle people where you know it hurts to be jostled, and you are so careful because you know how keenly the pain can be felt, surely you have to allow for the possibility that others do not move with such caution because they do not have the empathetic understanding which gives rise to it. This does not make such people monsters—for such a definition would merely be based on their difference from you—but simply different. 

You’re forced then to conclude that these people did not intend to hurt you. Either they had not experienced a similar pain in their lives or they found it difficult to see the pain you yourself could experience.

Superconductivity: Draft Notes

In modern society, conductors surround us. We cannot throw a rock in any direction without hitting a conductor, and the basic premise of how conductors operate is that the current which flows through them is proportional to the voltage which exists across (them) from their endpoints. However, there are a certain class of metals and allows which violate this basic principle of electronics. 1911, Kamme(?) Onnes discovered that for (metal name)/(a class of elements termed superconductors) the resisistance of the material falls to zero below a certain temperature T_c. Nearly twenty years later (First name) Meissner, discovered that the same metals which exhibited this strange free electron motion also exhibited perfect diamagnetism, namely when placed in a free magnetic field (need the precise name for clarity), they developed a magnetization which precisely canceled said external magnetic field to result in a zero magnetic field. 

The objective of this experiment is to exhibit and test the basic characteristics of superconductivity 

Such ideal (or perfect conductors) only exist in the realm of toy physics models (in the same world as the spherical cow, or the non-abelian supersymmetric fluid), and can simplify calculations where in reality resistance is non-zero but is sufficiently small as to be negligible. 

The experiment demonstrates/illustrates the main characteristics of Type I and Type II superconductors, namely the fall off of resistance and the expulsion of magnetic fields below a certain temperature. Given metals and alloys whose superconducting properties are known and whose Type (either I, II, or neither) is also known, we produce plots of magnetization as a function of applied field and resistance as a function of temperature, for each sample/material in order to confirm their superconducting properties. For each sample, we also plot the critical magnetic field as a function of temperature, to reproduce the (1-T/T_c)^(1/2) (Check this) dependence already known. Possible sources of error in these measurements are discussed, and additional experimental arrangements to test new effects of superconductivity are discussed. 

We perform these same measurements on an ``unknown” sample to determine whether it is superconducting, and if so, whether it is a Type I or Type II superconductor. 

The experimental set up used to take these measurements is described and 

The purpose of this experiment is to illustrate the main characteristics of Type I and Type II superconductors (SCs), namely the fall off of resistance below a critical temperature and the expulsion of net magnetic fields below a magnetic field at that temperature. We also demonstrate how Type II superconductors are distinguished from Type I superconductors by the partial penetration of magnetic fields into the interior of Type II SCs when they are above the first critical field value but below a second critical field value. We confirm the superconducting properties and Types of various known samples by studying them near their superconducting regime and plotting their magnetization as a function of applied field and resistance as a function of temperature. We also plot the critical magnetic field as a function of temperature, for each sample, to reproduce the characteristic $[1-(T/T_c)^2]^(1/2)$ behavior. We repeat these measurements on an unknown sample to determine whether it is superconducting, and if so, whether it is Type I and Type II. The experimental arrangement required to conduct these tests is discussed and possible sources of error are outlined. We conclude by discussing experimental arrangements which could test additional characteristic effects of superconductivity. 


Superconductors are distinguished from perfect conductors for while perfect conductors exhibit exactly zero electrical resistance only, superconductors (in their superconducting phase) exhibit zero electrical resistance in addition to the expulsion of magnetic fields from their interior.

Confusion: Phase Transition and Superconductors
There is an ambiguity in how the phase transition properties of superconductors are characterized. First, the general definition of the order of a phase transition, as given by Ehrenfest, is that an $n-th$ order phase transition exhibits a discontinuity in the $n-th$ derivative of the free energy. This $n-th$ derivative is usually (perhaps even exclusively) taken to be with respect to temperature, but it is the possibility that it could also be a mixed partial derivative which makes the order definition of a superconducting phase transition ambiguous. 

There are a number of ambiguities. First, it is known that Ginzburg Landau theory describes second order phase transitions, and this order of phase transition can be characterized according to the derivative definition. For example, the theory predicts that below a certain temperature an order parameter continuously (but non-differentiably) changes from a zero to a non-zero value. Because the order parameter is a first derivative of the free energy (the derivative with respect to magnetic field), and it is the first temperature derivative of this order parameter which changes discontinuously, we can claim that it is a second derivative of the free energy which is discontinuous. Thus we have a second order phase transition. 

Ginzburg-Landau theory describes Type I superconductors, and thus we would ordinarily claim that Type I superconductors exhibit a 2nd order phase transition. However, the characteristic plot of the magnetization of an ideal Type 1 supercondutor as a function of applied field, shows that the function is discontinuous at the critical field. Now phase transitions are not ordinarily defined in terms of variables other than temperature, but assuming they were the standard plot of M(H) for a Type I superconductor would imply that it is exhibiting a 1st order phase transition at Hc. This is the ambiguity and my confusion. 

Possible Resolutions?
There is a second order phase transition as we vary T, but a first order phase transition as we vary H. Thus it’s possible for the order of the phase transition to change when we change the variable we’re focusing on. 
There really is no discontinuity in the M(H) plot. Namely there is not a vertical drop off at H_c but a steep (and not vertical) decline. 
Something else?

Establishing the Why

If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it.
—Toni Morrison

One of the themes running through this essay is that much of a physicist’s work is the search for and filling of gaps in knowledge. This is a perspective on her work rarely communicated in the physicist’s education but is obviously manifest in the physicist’s everyday activities. And yet this perspective is not specific to physics, and not even to science; it applies to academia at large. Epistemological narratives define an academic subject and it is the holes within these narratives which give practitioners the space to extend the discipline in new directions and thus afford it the ability to answer questions it had never before considered. 

This is indeed the beauty of knowledge, that it is solid, seemingly immutable and inviolable, yet it can be created. That an understanding which did not exist at one point can exist at another, that the world so seemingly arbitrary and chaotic is actually governed by a framework which is specific and which can be understood through discernible and extendable patterns. It is the search for and expression of these patterns that makes so intoxicating the work of scientists, but it is the nature of this search which is most hidden in the scientist’s actual education.

There is a gap in the way physicists are formally trained. This is a gap which must eventually be bridged as the student becomes a researcher, but it is often a bridging not precipitated by the institutions which had supplied the student with much of his or her prior education. It is often something the student  must develop for him or herself or if available, with the assistance of a more able practitioner. 

—
Kuhn explains there is a reason for this and this reason is tied to the seemingly inimitable progress of science. The connotations of the word indoctrination make one reluctant to apply it to a subject which believes itself to be so uniquely focused on a search for the Truth, but how else would one describe a professional education where students are taught specifically what to think and cannot, if they are to be successful, question too deeply the foundations of their thinking? Language being what it is, we must soften our claim and say professional education is indoctrination in the denotative sense, if not in the connotative one. Namely, although there are institutional incentives which coerce students into learning specific things and in specific ways, the resulting effects are not purely detrimental to the individual student nor to the larger scientific and social system in which individual operates. In fact this method of training scientists seems overwhelmingly effective in achieving the goals of science. 
(In fact this method of indoctrination seems overwhelmingly effective in circumscribing the effects of the indoctrination itself. People who are educated in this way are more capable, if not always more willing, to formally question the basis of their thinking than others without this education. (NOT TRUE)

It is not specifically, that these foundations are absolutely known to be correct. Indeed, they are not and contemporary notions to the contrary, the history of science suggests that undue fidelity to these foundations are often the greatest retardants to the accepting new and useful scientific theories. But subscription to these foundations makes it easier to work within the field and undertake the daily work of problem solving that comprises much of a scientist’s career. And this daily work not only constitutes the typical progress we see presented in the standard research article, but also leads, albeit unintentionally, to the scientific breakthrough where a previous way of viewing the world is relinquished in favor of another one judged to be more useful. 

The dichotomy between the soldier and the revolutionary.

My Education
There really has never been a time when I was satisfied with my physics education. At the beginning of MIT, I was taking these introductory classes when I wanted to take more advanced ones, and when I got to these advanced classes I felt they were geared towards a particular epistemological mindset that I didn’t completely agree with. I mean, why are these men standing up at the front of the classroom and telling us things we can just as easily find in a textbook? It came to a point where I couldn’t take it anymore. I realized my education was inadequate. I thought of all the scientific biographies I read and I thought about the skills which were manifest in the great things these men did and I wondered why my education was failing to teach me this skills. So of course, I was extremely dissatisfied, and of course, from there I was able to move forward.  

I realized that the fatal mistake was not that MIT was providing the wrong education; the mistake was my belief that it was capable of providing the correct one.

—

This work comes out of a large amount of discontent. While I was a student I felt a large degree of frustration at being unable to bridge the gap I felt was necessary to be bridged to become a researcher. Worst still the education which I had assumed was geared towards bridging that gap seemed to encourage habits of thought and work which were entirely antithetical to what I thought research embodied. Of course this could have simply meant that what I thought simply did not bear a clear resemblance to reality, but as I continued in my formal academic education, participated in research, and learned more of the history of scientific work I confirmed that my intuitions were largely accurate. 

The first response to this knowledge was denial. I recognized a gap in education that almost no one else seemed to see nor care about and thus my initial response was to assume that what I saw was not there. But I could only maintain this perspective as long as I closed my eyes to the inadequacies in my own work and the space between what my work was and what I wanted it to be. 

It would be great if this book existed in a purely scientific, historical, analytical tradition of academic papers. But the work of a scientists requires a philosophical tangle and transition which requires an inspection of the humanist motives of becoming a scientist. Thus as I discuss the work of a scientist I will be forced to discuss the personality characteristic which work to change a student into a scientist. 


If one were to read the historical biographies of physicists and mathematicians, one would note that I am writing this book out of the order in a typical career chronology. Beleaguered by the pressures of their early professional education and later the formal work on a academic, it appears that most scientists never found the time nor inclination to write qualitative books on the nature of science until the middle to end of their careers.  Arguably, they also had neither the experience nor professional clout to convincingly write such books until they had spent many decades immersed in the work of a scientist. Standouts among these books are Poincare’s …, Bridgman’s …., Feynman’s … But it should be clear that regardless of when such books are written, they would be most useful to the young scientist at the start, rather than the end, of her career, namely at the point when she is first forming and solidifying her professional identity. 

I have to write this work now because years from now (like most academics immersed in the tenure-track) I most likely will not care about these matters. It is only now, that this question feels the most visceral and relevant to me that I will have the motivation and emotional attachment to see that it is answered well. 


Following Toni Morrison’s advice, I’m writing something that I desperately wanted to read years ago and which I only saw glimpses of in the existing work. 

This book is in a way written to the me of five or six years ago. This is the me who wanted desperately to improve the quality of his work but found no recourse to do so. Very few books in the modern physics or general science literature are geared towards connecting the the young woman or man to their future self, namely the student to the researcher (some books in this vein are Bridgman’s, Carlos’s). This I think is primarily because this is the job of the institutions of which the student and eventual scientist is a part. It is the graduate institution and not specifically the student herself who is to supply the infrastructure and tacit education required to turn the student into a formal researcher.

Letting the Noise Quiet Down

In the New York Public Library Podcast, Junot Díaz speaking to Paul Holdengraber mentioned why his writing is so uneconomical. He described a need to write until all of the noise which has nothing at all to do with the writing fades into the background. Here’s his direct quote. 

I’m the least economical writer you’ll ever meet… I definitely think for each page there is at least eight books…There’s a part of me that can’t write until all the noise inside of me goes down; the noise that is “I want to finish a story because finishing a story is good”; the noise that is like “Hey if you write something somebody might read it and clap”; the noise of “Wouldn’t it be nice to have a thousand dollars if you finish this?”; the noise of this country basically only believes people have value if they’re productive. 
	All this noise has to drop before my characters speak to me, and so often I feel like it’s this weird fasting meditation. I spend the first 500 pages just waiting for the silence to open up, and once the silence opens up the characters start talking. It’s, again, the worst way to write. I can think of way better ways, but I don’t have [access to] those.

I completely agree with what Junot says about needing the noise to die down. There are so many personal preoccupations which can filter into and affect your work but which have nothing to do with the internal world of the work itself. For me, my work can often slide into being a reflection of my insecurity or loneliness. In the past these personal hangups affected the focus I was able to lend to my work, also more basically delimited the work I chose to do. Believing my validation could be achieved through the problems in physics and mathematics I solved, I tried to complete ambitious and unrigorous projects and often fell into the vein of crack pottery. The work was uncareful and muddled, both clear reflections of the mind who developed it. 

Something I am learning now: how to separate my personal concerns from the work itself. There is strangely some anxiety and fear associated with the work I do, possibly because I believe that this work can save me in some way if it is done well. But this fear has nothing at all to do with what I’m studying. The structure of mathematics and the physical world, cannot be better elucidated by following the course laid out by these emotions and thus these emotions exist as distractions which pull one away from more rational paths, paths which have more fidelity to the work itself than they do to the person doing it.

The Limitations of Formalism: Statistical Physics and moving beyond formalism
I have been much gratified by the amount of progress I’ve been able to make with the so called “IMDB problem”. What was initially a simple stochastic simulation problem has revealed itself to be analytically interesting and a good model of how my future work can progress. But in spite of the new directions I’ve been able to take this work in, I can’t help but feel that the questions I am asking are confined by a certain conceptual boundary and that the larger question itself is limited by the framework in which it is studied. Namely, I feel I am not exploring all the possible interesting themes within statistical physics, and statistical physics itself appears to be a limiting formalism in which to generate questions. 

These musings have led to a recognition of some discontent with my approach to working. If I want to move beyond the formalism which I feel is limiting the questions I can ask, I need to think more carefully about the formalisms I engage with and my understanding of them. 

First, there is the within formalism question of possible directions within a piece of work. For the “IMDB problem (i.e. “The Model of Thermally Distributed Permutations”), in order to extend the work I asked some standard questions I found in statistical mechanics. Questions like, what is the partition function of the system, what are the moments, what is the energy and free energy. It was my attempts to answer these questions which led me to a deeper understanding of the system. But there are many more questions concerning basic statistical mechanics systems I can ask; I simply did not ask such questions because I am less familiar with them. Questions like, does the system exhibit phase transitions? What is the system’s non-equilibrium behavior? Can I describe it in terms of fermions and bosons? Does it have a field theory representation?

I think regardless of whatever system I study I will run into this problem of having a dearth of questions to ask. This suggests that it would be useful to have a running list of questions for each physics subject, which I can ask about a particular quantum system. I can consolidate these questions into the fundamental physics documents I plan to compose, or include them in the modules I intend to write for specific topics. 

For statistical physics some questions I can ask are
Does the system exhibit phase transitions?
What is the non-equilibrium behavior of the system?
Can the system be simulated stochastically?
Does the system have a clear large N extrapolation?
What happens if we make the system quantum mechanical?
Is there a field theory representation of the system?

Now, comes the concern with formalism at large. The above list of questions certainly helps me expand my analysis within the framework of statistical mechanics, but it is still limited by statistical mechanics itself. This is partly because I seem unable to escape the labeling which is used to categorize and understand the physical world but through such categorization fails to describe it accurately. The other reason is that these subjects are in large part defined by the questions they allow us to answer so of course if you derive your question from a specific method within the subject (like computing a partition function)  you will of course be partly limited by the methods of the subject itself. 

There is no clear way to move past this. Formulating concrete and interesting problems is hard enough without requiring them to also move beyond the boundaries of physics subjects. But at least having a notion of what the various subjects in physics are, and what questions each can answer may help to supply you with a sense of how your current analyses are limited and ways you can extend them in new directions. 

Thus there are two takeaways from this discussion: 
Create Fundamental Physics/Basics: Consolidate fundamental physics notes which list the basic questions you can ask about a physics subject. 
Create Modern Physics: Create a short list of modern physics subject/fields of research. This list should contain a short description of the subject, discussion of the questions it asks and can currently answer and those which it wants to but cannot answer/and one or two equations which exist at the foundation of the subject/current references for subject. Examples: Cosmology, Quantum Many Particle Interactions, Atom/Photon interactions. 

Remember the Why: Creating these documents will help you to have better ideas of how to connect the problems you’re trying to solve to other interesting physical situations or problems.

Quotes
Here are some quotes that I’ve been meaning to write down. 

In your place, if there is pain, nurse it, and if there is a flame, don’t snuff it out, don’t be brutal with it. Withdrawal can be a terrible thing when it keeps us awake at night, and watching others forget us sooner than we’d want to be forgotten is no better. We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to feel nothing so as not to feel anything—what a waste.
— Call Me by Your Name by Andre Aciman

I may have come close, but I never had what you had. Something always held me back or stood in the way. How you live your life is your business. But remember, our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once. Most of us can’t help but live as though we’ve got two lives to live, one is the mockup, the other the finished version, and then there are all those versions in between. But there’s only one, and before you know it, your heart is worn out, and as for your body, there comes a point when no one looks at it, much less wants to come near it. Right now there’s sorrow. I don’t envy the pain. But I envy you the pain.
— Same



This illusion owes everything to the great American illusion that our state is a state to be envied by other people: we are powerful, and we are rich. But our power makes us uncomfortable and we handle it very ineptly. The principal effect of our material well-being has been to set the children’s teeth on edge. If we ourselves were not so fond of this illusion, we might understand ourselves and other peoples better than we do, and be enabled to help them understand us. I am very often tempted to believe that this illusion is all that is left of the great dream that was to have become America; whether this is so or not, this illusion certainly prevents us from making America what we say we want it to be. 
— James Baldwin “Nobody Knows My Name”

History provides plenty of evidence of black homosexuality and bisexuality, but we don’t have to go back in time to find examples of men sleeping with men. We can find them in our own circles. They have always been there, but we did not always talk about them. We saw them leading the church choir. We spotted them on the street….They were the easy ones to understand because they fit neatly into a box that allowed us to reduce and define them into a simple stereotype. They made us feel good about ourselves because they could make us laugh, but, just as important, we felt good because we were not them. 
— Keith Boykin Beyond The Down Low

We liked them, in part, because they knew their place. They knew the role they were supposed to play in our lives, and they performed it on cue. We liked them because they did not threaten us by forcing us to challenge our preconceived notions of homosexuality. And that was the great paradox. By being so different, they actually made us feel at ease. If they had looked and spoken and acted just like us, we might not have been as comfortable. How would we pick them out and identify them if they were just like us? But they were identifiable, or so we thought, and so we could relax because we knew who they were. They were not us. 
— Keith Boykin Beyond The Down Low


1:41 PM
A Religion out of Appreciation
In order for me to live my life and do work in physics amongst other people and amongst my insecurities, I need to change. Not change my behavior, although that would certainly be the result of the change I do affect, but to change my perspective on living. 

In those jovial and relaxing moments of conversation when people feel content to contemplate the philosophy of their lives, the observation is often posed that for each year we are alive the next year appears to pass more quickly. My explanation to this observation had been standardized long ago. When we are five years old, a single year comprises 20% of our life and so when a new year comes and goes we seem to have become much older, merely by proportion, than the adults whose years pass like collections of months to us. 

Another explanation is that when we are young, the world is new to us and thus almost every additional experience is like being exposed to an aspect of the world never before seen. Yet when we grow older, the luster of the world, through repeated inspection, appears faded and we cannot help but see each additional experience, no matter how novel it is to us, as something we’ve seen before.

But here’s an alternative. As we grow older in age and in experience, we become more and more invested in the standard achievement narrative of a life. This is the story which posits life as a journey to some worthy destination, and an individual as the traveler who braves trials and dragons to find the reward at the end of the road. But in such a narrative meaning exists most truly, if not exclusively, at the end of our travels, and each step only has significance in proportion to how much closer it brings us to that end. 

Children, who are less exposed to this narrative and consequently do not do battle with it, are given a greater license to see their moments in life just as they are. Thus these moments, not parsed through an exclusively utilitarian rubric, do not pass through them like water, but get stuck to their insides and stay with them. So that in a year they have lived through and held onto hundreds of significant moments, while their adult counterparts jaded and tired, have held onto, if they are lucky, one or two. 

To put it simply: children appreciate and thus experience the world more, and adults appreciate the world less. 

I am falling into the banal adult habit of romanticizing a childhood I no longer experience. To be complete, I must admit there certainly are demons in childhood which are sometimes only exorcised when those children become adults. Demons of fear, narcissism, and obedience, and these certainly can destroy the life of a child as surely as the child’s more beneficial predilections can save it. 

But one must acknowledge that appreciation of where one is right now is largely antithetical to the way most adults conceptualize their lives. It is certainly not the way I, for the longest time, saw myself nor my work. Recognizing some gap in life, something hollow and bare or some meaning not supplied, I believed that this gap could be filled through something grand, or at least something which scaled in magnitude to what I perceived was the size of the gap. And since the hole was felt now, I constructed a story which if faithfully followed, would allow me to eliminate it or reduce its size in the future. 

And yet the story was not constant, and the solution to the emptiness fluctuated in time so that the gap always remained, and its filling always existed beyond the horizon. And strangely, although I saw quite clearly the lies of consumerist and materialist culture, that is I realized that nothing one could buy would give one so much peace as to feel no need to buy anything again, I did not see the parallel lies in the much less maligned, or even noticed, achievement culture. I did see that those who had already achieved so much were often the most hungry for more achievement, but I could not see at all what this fact had to do with life. 

The physicist turned financial quantitative analyst Emanuel Derman once said that “Ambition is a constant state of dissatisfaction with the present”. However, so too is depression, and the danger is that one can allow the reality of dissatisfaction to feature so prominently in one’s evaluation of the present that the present turns from merely dissatisfactory to completely intolerable. This usually occurs when one ties one’s sense of contentment too closely to the achievement of certain goals. In such cases it becomes impossible to appreciate the moments which pave the path to the achievement because one is always so focused on achieving. 

It is very easy to look at your current life and realize you are not where you want to be. You don’t have the job you want. You don’t have the amount of money you want. You don’t have something which you believe will make your life better. It is also normal to look at your past and realize that all your life you have felt somewhat incomplete and dissatisfied. The natural next step is abdication; if one is always unfulfilled, what is the purpose of seeking anything?

The tragic irony is that we may be so unfulfilled because we are so constantly seeking. Perhaps with a world as full as ours, we must entertain the dangerous possibility that the emptiness we feel is created, arising from the space between where we are now and where we want to be. And this place of where we want to be, as a reflection of our insecurities and the uncritically accepted lessons of our culture, is more of us than of the world. And this possibility is so dangerous because its full investigation will demand that we question the delusions of identity and personality that we believe make us who we are. It has taken me very long to realize this and indeed I am still trying to interrogate this new knowledge, but it seems true: The way I have been taught to see—or less generously, the way I have accepted how to see—the world is actually just an elaborate means of obscuring that world from view.

Thus there is a contest between looking at a life and seeing all that is still missing and looking at a life and seeing all that is already there.

And so comes the lesson I am still learning: Any approach to work or to living which makes you incapable of appreciating the decontextualized moments of your life, the small steps whose larger purpose have yet to be discerned, is a perspective which is wrong no matter how necessary you believe it is to getting you to where you should be. 

And here, too, is the goal: To see our experiences through a lens which takes them as ends in of themselves and not simply as means for some alternative present. Seeing the moments of our life for what they contain and not exclusively for what we think they may give us, that is, not for how much closer we think they will bring us to where we believe we must be. 


[//]

Seeing the world and my work within it in the much spurned myopic lens which views these activities as ends in of themselves and not simply as means for some alternative present. Really seeing the events of our life for what they are and not exclusively for what we think they may give us, for how much closer we think they will bring us to getting what we believe we need. 

The lesson I am still learning:
It has taken me very long to recognize this, to realize that the way I had been taught, or more accurately accepted how, to see the world is really just a way to obscure that world from view.

Black Boy Looks at White Boy

“Man,” said a Negro musician to me once, talking about Norman, “the only trouble with that cat is that he’s white.” This does not mean exactly what it says—or, rather, it does mean exactly what it says, and not what it might be taken to mean—and it is a very shrewd observation. What my friend meant was that to become a Negro man, let alone a Negro artist, one had to make oneself up as one went along. This had to be done in the not-at-all-metaphorical teeth of the world’s determination to destroy you. The world had prepared no place for you, and if the world had its way, no place would ever exist. 

Now, this is true for everyone, but, in the case of a Negro, this truth is absolutely naked: if he deludes himself about it, he will die. This is not the way this truth presents itself to white men, who believe the world is theirs and who, albeit unconsciously, expect the world to help them in the achievement of their identity. 

But the world does not do this—for anyone; the world is not interested in anyone’s identity. And, therefore the anguish which can overtake a white man comes in the middle of his life, when he must make the almost inconceivable effort to divest himself of everything he has ever expected or believed, when he must take himself apart and put himself together again, walking out of the world into limbo, or into what certainly looks like limbo. 

This cannot yet happen to any Negro of Norman’s age, for the reason that his delusions and defenses are either absolutely impenetrable by this time, or he has failed to survive them. “I want to know how power works,” Norman once said to me, “how it really works, in detail.” Well, I know how power works, it has worked on me, and if I didn’t know how power worked, I would be dead. And it goes without saying, perhaps, that I have simply never been able to afford myself any illusions concerning the manipulation of that power. My revenge, I decided very early, would be to achieve a power which outlasts kingdoms.
—“The Black Boy Looks at the White Boy”

This passage resonated with me in a way I have learned to expect from Baldwin. It primarily concerns scripts, choices, and the ability to live a life where the latter is seemingly determined by the former. The fact that we do not choose to what family and in what location or at what time we are born is something rarely ever discussed concerning the human condition. I think this is because we assume and reflect our ambient identities so immediately after we are born that it becomes inconceivable to contemplate a world where we are not who our birth in a certain place and certain time ostensibly mandated us to become. Change those circumstances, and you not merely change a life, but you erase it and replace it with one whose uncertainty makes it so opaque as to be unimaginable. 

But to what sex, sexual orientation, social class, and race (and a plethora of other factors) we are born is also not of our own choosing, a fact which assumes tragic undertones when one recognizes the quality of one’s life can change drastically according to which specific categories of these qualities we fall into. The tragedy exists not only in how other people treat and see us, but in how this external perspective is often internalized during adolescence and can then ever after be directed, unconsciously or not, at all so called marginalized people, even when we see such people in our own (the) mirror. 

It is the self loathing that this external perspective creates that is so toxic to the individual. And it is this self loathing which demands, if life is to be lived in any sane way, a different perspective on oneself, namely a perspective which is not appropriated wholesale from one’s surrounding culture. Finding no tenable model for the self in one’s environment, for (as we have said) all available models are cancerous, one is forced to create oneself without the standard recourse of emulation. 

This is my interpretation of what Baldwin means when he states that “to become a Negro man… one had to make oneself up as one went along.” When your culture supplies you with a narrative of self which conflicts with everything one needs in a narrative of self—namely self-respect and agency—one is forced to abandon the provided narrative and to find some other standard by which to live a life. 

Badwin expressed this idea explicitly in an interview

“All you are ever told in this country about being black is that it is a terrible, terrible thing to be. Now, in order to survive this, you have to dig down into yourself and re-create yourself, really, according to no image which yet exists in America. You have to impose, in fact—this may sound very strange—you have to decide who you are, and force the world to deal with you and not with its idea of you.”
—  James Baldwin from Terkel Baldwin interview 1961


But the subtlety here is that this need to recreate yourself exists as surely for the privileged as it does for the typically marginalized. Because the thing that must be escaped is not the tone of the narrative, but the narrative itself, the idea that there is a story which can be pasted onto large swaths of people regardless of their individual histories. Surely, it is more difficult for white men to recognize this need, for the narrative which is readily supplied to them—a narrative which frames them as leaders in history, business, and all “respectable” fields of creativity—is something so palatable and so self-aggrandizing as to not seem to necessitate escape. 

This was perhaps the challenge Baldwin believed Mailer faced. The artist, if he chooses to speak, must try his best to speak authentically and it is impossible to do so if you have spent your life living within a script, no matter how positive, that you cannot question because you refuse to see it. (your identity is predicated on you not seeing it)

Thus there is a great irony in Baldwin’s statement. We all need to find the many things which define us apart from our environment and apart from the stories and caricatures other people use to understand us. It is these things that we find for ourselves which we say constitute a personal identity. And it appears that the conditions of marginalized people, conditions which make their lives more difficult by any reasonable measure, are the very conditions that make the need to create a personal identity so evident that it is perhaps easier for them to make an authentic choice of self than it is for the privileged. 

I think Baldwin’s statement extends beyond the experience of artists. It relates to all domains of work and life when we feel awkwardly placed because we cannot see our own values positively reflected in the communities we’re part of. Doris Lessing in her introduction to The Golden Notebook speaks of the people who leave organizations as those who are the most capable of affecting change within them, for they come to the organization recognizing that it does not represent all of who they are. Others who assimilate more easily have no need to question whether they should change themselves and therefore never also entertain the dual question of whether it is the organization itself which should be changed. But those who recognize some part of themselves which does not fit within the community, ask whether they are at fault and it is this questioning which leads to the possibility of changing the community. Thus most change in a community, Lessing argues, comes from those people whose natural impulse tells them to leave. 

There is no clear follow up as to what would lead such people to stay in the community and try to affect the change they deem is necessary. And one must acknowledge that, given what we know of history, not all such people ultimately improve their communities for the better.

Seeing no model on which to base a life, one is led to belief that one’s life is less valued. But this conclusion is derived from a value system which is not your own, and its implications concerning your life do not point towards a need to assimilate but to a need to develop your own value system and self. Doing so without a model on which to base this self, is more difficult, but it is not an undesirable difficulty for through it one is likely to find a more authentic and comfortably lived self. 


I am currently faced with such a decision. My distaste for the style and choice of topic in modern physics compelled me to question seriously the prospects of continuing to pursue a degree in the subject. Why, I asked myself, should I go to graduate school if I will be forced to study one of the half dozen fields of research I find so uninspiring? An inability to see how my own interest could be reconciled with the options of interests available to me, made me also question (indeed, even deny) the validity of my own motivations. I began to despise physics, and the idea of continuing to work within it seemed to close for good. 

But this year something seems to have changed. Something, a possibility, seems to have opened up. I can work in physics and find what I do interesting regardless of how it fits into modern research agendas. The desire to publish my work certainly has led me to attempt to connect it to modern fields of research, but this connection no longer seems to be a stringent requirement for me to be able to begin working.

We all have to do it and for all of us it is necessary to do it in order to live a life. But it is only for black people that the doing it is made so manifestly necessary because the models one could base one’s life on are so virulent and cancerous. White people seeing mosre positive but no less accurate in their totality portrayals of themselves can subsume a positive identity from who their role in the culture, from who the culture tells them to be. 

Of course we each need to find that thing, or those many things, which define us apart from our environment, the things which most people say constitute an identity. And it is a great irony that the conditions of a marginalized people would make that need so much more present in their lives than in the lives of the more privileged that it is perhaps easier for the former to make an authentic choice than it is for the latter.


The fear, or more accurately, the danger is that with previously marginalized people entering into the mainstream of popular culture, they wil

“Negroes know about each other what can here be called family secrets, and this means that one Negro, if he wishes, can ‘knock’ the other’s ‘hustle’—can give his game away. It is still not possible to overstate the price a Negro pays to climb out of obscurity—for it is a particular price, involved with being a Negro; and the great wounds, gouges, amputations, losses, scars, endured in such a journey cannot be calculated. 

But even this is not the worst of it, since he is really dealing with two hierarchies, one white and one black, the latter modeled on the former. The higher he rises, the less is his journey worth, since (unless he is extremely energetic and anarchic, a genuinely “bad nigger” in the most positive sense of the term) all he can possible find himself exposed to is the grim emptiness of the white world—which does not live by the standards it uses to victimize him—and the even more ghastly emptiness of black people who wish they were white. 

Therefore one “exceptional” Negro watches another “exceptional” Negro in order to find out if he knows how vastly successful and bitterly funny the hoax has been. Alliances, in the great cocktail party of the white man’s world, are formed, almost purely on this basis, for if both of you can laugh, you have a lot to laugh about. On the other hand, if only one of you can laugh , one of you, inevitably, is laughing at the other.”

Kuhn and Scientist’s ideas of themselves 
The tantalizing thing about Kuhn’s thesis is that contrary to what scientists tell themselves or tell the public their day to day goals are not specifically the elucidation of the fundamental laws of reality. Rather educated in a specific way and according to a specific tradition, they work to explicate the implications of that tradition and not really to question it.

E = Mc^2 vs. M = E/c^2
English is read from left to right and this order of reading is mapped onto how equations are read and interpreted. Thus the left hand side of an equation is read first and the right hand side is read last. The result is that the left hand side is defined (when equalities are interpreted as definitions) according to and in terms of the right hand side. The right hand side then is seen as more fundamental and the left hand side is seen as derivative of the more fundamental quantities of the right hand side. Think about the subtle change in meaning when we write

1/2 mv^2 = E 

or 

1/2mv^2 - mgh = L 

We (English speakers) automatically recognize that these equations are written in the “wrong order”. Therefore when we set two expressions equal to one another we need to be attentive to the ordering of the two expressions to ensure it reflects our intended meaning. 

The way Einstein’s famous mass energy result is typically written is E=Mc^2. This way of writing it, I think, is a residue of the non-relativistic intuition that matter and kinematics are the truly fundamental aspects of a system and energy is simply something derivative of those things. However, the standard explanation for why protons are so much more massive than electrons even though up and down quarks are much less massive than electrons is that the energy of the strong interactions makes up most of the mass of protons. This resolution, only possible given Einstein’s mass energy equivalence, places energy as the fundamental concept and the mass which makes up matter as something derived from it.

Moreover, the rest mass of the elementary particles also arises from a more fundamental and energy centered concept. The rest mass of all elementary particles, according to the Standard Model, arises from their coupling to the Higgs field. The Higgs field obtains a VEV and it is this VEV which, mathematically speaking, creates a mass term for all fermions. But the Higgs field obtains a VEV purely as a consequence of the form of its potential energy, a form which is posited as an assumption of the Standard model. Thus it is this potential energy which is responsible for giving all elementary particles their mass. 

In all, instead of writing Einstein’s famous mass-energy equivalence as E=mc^2, we should write it as M=E/c^2 because in our current understanding of physics it is energy and not mass which is the fundamental concept.

The Only One Who Speaks
In A Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, the narrator Yunior describes an interesting antagonism between writers and dictators. 

“What is it with dictators and writers anyway? Since before the infamous Caesar-Ovid war they have had beef. Like the Fantastic Four and Galactus, like the X-men and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, like the Teen-Titans and Deathstroke, Forman and Ali, Morrison and Crouch, Sammy and Sergio, they seem destined to be eternally linked in the halls of battle. Rushdie claims that tyrants and scribblers are natural antagonists. But I think that’s too simple. It lets writers off pretty easy. Dictators, in my opinion, just know competition when they see it. Same with writers. Like, after all, recognizes like.”

For the longest time, my humanist leanings led me to read this quote rather transparently and within the standard narrative of good versus evil. I saw those lonely documenters of culture and history working to expose the reality of a despot who seeks to control his populace through propaganda and violence. In this perspective writers exist in opposition to dictators as surely, and as tritely, as superheroes exist in opposition to villains. 

I only began to question this reading once I realized how fungible all narratives are. There is a space between lived reality and reality as it is depicted on the page and upon recognizing this distance I had no choice but to fault the medium which attempted to navigate it. But if the lived experience of an event could not be entirely communicated through its mere exposition, was it also possible that an exposition could lead someone to believe something not at all faithful to reality? When there is one architect controlling a narrative, is it not possible for a reader to live within this narrative as though it were reality itself?

Junot Díaz defines “El dictador” as “The only one who speaks,” but he does this ironically for he knows the definition applies just as well to writers. The writer and the dictator both have parasitic relationships with their audiences which masquerade as co-dependency or benefaction. They appear to provide one value in exchange for respect and admiration, but the value they provide is illusory and confining as it is based on something not at all naturally found in the world they occupy. And what they take from the reader, validation of themselves, is what the reader believes, inaccurately, “Los dictadores” are providing to them. But what they are really receiving is a constructed reality which fails constantly to mesh sensibly with an outside world. Frustration, confusion, and hopelessness are the end result when one applies narratives outside of the simple regimes of applicability in which these stories were first created.

When I was young, I loved Ayn Rands work (in particular The Fountainhead and Anthem) for many of the reasons the young enjoy her work. Because I felt disaffected, lonely, and misunderstood and I believed these states were imposed upon me by my environment. As I grew older my appreciation of her writing tempered, but, unlike much of the culture which now categorically vilifies Rand’s work, I still saw a considerable potency and relevance in what she wrote. Surely something which resonated with so many people could not in fact be completely untrue of the world, and thus if nothing else, Rand was saying something about how people (perhaps specifically Americans) like to see themselves. But what really attached me to her work, was the fact that so many could identify with it even amidst the clear space between Rand’s truth and the lived truth of people’s lives. This fact led me to a disconcerting respect of Rand’s ability to construct of a narrative even if I no longer saw eminent truth in the specific content of that narrative. 

It was not exactly that Rand was attempting to manipulate people’s insecurities and anger, although that was precisely what she was doing, but the language in which she was writing so polemical and confident that it seemed specifically geared to give stability to those who most wanted some foundational principles by which to live a life. 

Long ago I began and later abandoned an essay on narrative manipulation. The point of the essay was to illustrate the importance of personal research and questioning when reading political articles or watching the news channels like Fox News.  I showed many examples (all entirely from Conservative web sites or Republican congressmen) of how someone could construct a convincing narrative by employing logical fallacies, a biased report of evidence, and a selective interpretation of statistics. What I of course did not realize was that the very essay I was writing was an example of the problem I was writing about. This I think is an inevitable fact of writing. Most writers would not admit that their work consists primarily of directing and channeling what and how the reader thinks, but it is the end result when a book is successful, that is, when a book is said to have “changed” a reader. Adept writers can do this with such softness of touch that at the end of their work you’re led to believe that what you now know is true and would be true regardless of what you have just read. But by receiving a message from a single voice, it is difficult to escape the fact that the world that your mind lives in, for the time that the voice is speaking, is one which is created. 

This idea and its increasingly manifest truth has been unsettling to me, a person who spends so much time, and greatly enjoys his time, immersed in the narratives of others. I have decided that all the truth and legitimacy I lend to these narratives has as much to do with the actual legitimate truth as do the cultural narratives I so roundly reject. Because both are crafted representations of a life and both exist as models by which to understand one’s place. And yet why do I accept one and impugn the other. I look at the American dream and I look at the story of the Achievement narrative which frames Schwinger’s, Feynman’s, or Chandrasekhar’s biographies and while I can intuit falseness in the former all the latter seem to inspire me. What is it in humans that make us so attracted to these fatally limited and misleading means of conveying informations? In other words, what makes these narratives so compelling, and what is it about us that makes us so willing, because it is indeed a choice, to be compelled by them?


The knowledge that compelling writing is not necessarily true writing has forced me to question my love of Baldwin’s writing. The feeling of self-recognition Baldwin’s writing induces in me is so strong as to assuredly be the result of an artfully created story. I previously believed that in Baldwin I had finally found a writer who not only wrote masterfully but wrote the authentically about the world I saw world. But perhaps this fact was more explicitly true than I realized. Perhaps Baldwin was indeed affirming the truth I saw in the world or more accurately the truth I had led myself believe existed. But whether that truth was the real truth of the world was an entirely different matter, and it was one that I never attempted to investigate. 

In explaining his work, Díaz (in the New York Public Library podcast) said the real story of A Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao could not be gleaned by following precisely where Yunior leads or to where the intellectual insecurity Yunior deliberately creates in the reader may push you 

If you listen to Yunior on where you should put your eye on the text, you will miss the whole book. So when Yunior says look up Trujillo, as soon as you start following him, you’re fucked. You would do better reading against his voice.

I imagine that many people see Junot Díaz’s writing as an outcropping of the current ethnic and cultural zeitgeist that grips this country. The white anglo saxon protestants who so dominated social and artistic affairs merely through shear numerical magnitude and political power, now comprise an ever decreasing majority in this country and previously marginalized groups are receiving opportunities to have influential voices in arenas where, previously, they seemingly would have been talking to themselves. This however is a transparent reading of Díaz’s work. It is a way of missing the whole point. The surface level story of Oscar Wao is a story of a boy searching for and ultimately finding love which lasts just momentarily before his death. But more surreptitiously, Oscar Wao through the narration of Yunior  is about the stories people tell us and the stories we grant credibility. The book poses the question, given that these stories are often so unreliable, why do we accept them so uncritically?

Baldwin has this incredible idea that the things we believe in are believed, not necessarily because they follow as inductions from reality but because we need these beliefs in order to sanely live within reality. Thus the people throughout U.S. history who called themselves white, believed in “Negro inferiority” not because people from a certain continent were in any biological, or perhaps more importantly, existential way inferior, but because this belief gave white people an implicit identity which could not be lost through any life failure on their part. Yoshino gives a parallel example with regard to bisexual erasure. Both heterosexuals and homosexuals tend to deny the existence of bisexuals because heterosexuals do not want to introduce any ambiguity into the identity which gives them their privileged status, and homosexuals do not want to weaken the immutability argument which has been so politically useful.

In short the reason the narratives we believe in are so compelling is that they are simpler representations of our lives, and we need these simpler representations not only because they are easier to manage but also because they support our sense of agency in direct contradiction to a world which so constantly denies it.

Díaz’s full quote. 
If you listen to Yunior on where you should put your eye on the text, you will miss the whole book. So when Yunior says “Look up Trujillo,” as soon as you start following him, you’re fucked. You would do better reading against his voice. In other words, I would not look up Trujillo. I would look up The Beyonder. I would look up the Dune references in the book. And you would get a way better understanding not only of Yunior’s project, but of who the fuck he actually is. I mean who Yunior is is hidden in code in the book, and the code is all in the popular, literature [and] culture that Yunior misdirects you from looking at.

So I think there’s a lot at stake here. Yunior’s not just simply trying to push your buttons that you don’t know the Dominican history. He’s picking a fight so you don’t look over your shoulder.

The Premise of Objectivity
The idea that one can experience the world objectively is based on the assumption that it is possible to perceive the world without a subjective lens. Perception, however, requires an individual perceiver, and this perceiver may be distinguished from other perceivers in the types of sensations available to him, his abilities in sensing these sensations, and more over the interpretive framework for understanding that these sensations exist or even what they are. Thus, claiming the possible objectivity of perception is like claiming it is possible to perceive without the existence of an individual perceiver. Since this is impossible, not only the premise of objectivity but all conclusions which are derived from it are false. 

But when people claim to operate according to objectivity they mean something less stringent than the true objectivity which is unobtainable in any realistic sense. They mean narrative objectivity, that is a desire to inspect the facts without imposing a priori a narrative to explain them. But human understanding is built on a connection of ideas and such connections are inevitably communicated as narrative.

A Dissonance in Meeting
Recalling all the things I ever wanted, I also recall that often when I was unable to obtain these things I would look internally for the fault. I would blame myself for my inability to establish close relationships and when I put myself in front of someone new and worked to gain acceptance and found rejection again I couldn’t help but agree. I took the coldness and distance I felt from the world and I did not merely reflect it, I internalized it. I made myself believe, unbeknownst to any conscious will, that the distance was my fault; it arose from qualities I lacked or flaws I could not hide. 

And with the inward eye searching for and constantly turning up the evidence for my incrimination, a self-loathing so vast and murky was created that in the resulting introspection it was indistinguishable from motivation. And so I was motivated. I was motivated in spite of my acne, in spite of my height, in spite of my general inability to find some spark of personal value that would make others accept me. It did not matter that my immediate family already valued and loved me, for I had spent most of my time in ‘the world’  and ‘the world’ was populated by this unidentifiable ‘other’ in whose eyes I was at first glance reduced to a stereotype or caricature of who I was. 

It would be unfair to reduce completely all of my past accomplishments to attempts to gain approval from a world I felt to be actively and existentially hostile. But it would be inaccurate to say those accomplishments were independent of my insecurity. For when new attempts were made and the sought for goals were not achieved, insecurity was the ultimate consequence. And over the years (the past few years) the cycle from insecurity to ambition, to ambition-denial, to deepening insecurity has become so entrenched and so habitual that I now find myself at a point where my sense of self is so insubstantial, the parts of myself that I like so seemingly non-existent that there is no internal core to provide the soil for any seed of new ambition. 

Because in the end what I accomplished by internalizing my feelings of rejection and allowing a stranger’s first impressions of and reactions to me affect the way I saw myself was erosion. Over months that became years, I eroded any internal standard of value I could use to more diplomatically judge myself. I eroded any sense of myself as a unique and worthy human being. And no matter how much I worked out, no matter the intellectual gymnastics, this personal vacuum remained and grew. 

To think that your only possible responses to social rejection is to find fault in yourself or in the party that rejected you is to create a false dichotomy. And the source of the falseness exists in the pivotal word: rejection. It purports a hierarchy of legitimacy where a group or person lower in the hierarchy can only increase their standing through a successful supplication of someone higher. But in these interactions which act as the impetus for your self loathing, no real supplication is taking place, so the missed connection should not be seen as rejection. You are not applying for acceptance, and so acceptance cannot really be denied you. Instead, what we have in the missed meeting of two individuals is dissonance, a misalignment of values, goals, perhaps even beliefs. And this dissonance cannot be faulted to either party. Although I believe that given a certain receptive mindset and no small amount of effort, two strangers can be made to appreciate or at least more clearly see one another I can find no reason to believe that this process can and should occur instantaneously in a first meeting. Perhaps in your emotional response to these events what you’re displaying is grief at a lost opportunity for connection. So be it. But do not allow this grief to metastasize into an internal critique which cannot faithfully be derived from the event that elicited it.

DreamScape
Two nights ago I had a dream. I made the mistake of waiting until now to document it, so my recollection of the dream is fuzzy and difficult to pin down. But I do recall it was about love. In particular, I remember a point when I was standing next to a girl and she asked me something I can no longer remember. My response was taken from James Baldwin: “Love changes you I told her. That’s what happens. You’re never the same person coming out of Love that you are going in.” She looked down when I said this, demurring, perhaps because she knew the person I was in love with was her. Now, I cannot remember if she took my hand or if I took hers, but soon we were running together and I felt that glow that comes from loving and believing, but not yet knowing, that you are loved the same way in return. 

We reached an auditorium and I let go of her hand. She walked ahead of me and sat in a mostly empty row of seats and sat focused on the curtained stage. I hesitated and defaulted to a row behind her. For some reason, I believed she needed her space. But five minutes later I was standing up and moving to her row, sidling among the seats until I reached her. “Can I sit here?” I asked, and the dream ended.

Writing Styles
What characterizes good writing? Is there a universal standard or does one’s audience and intent matter in the characterization? When I think about the various writers I label as good and/or bad there are some consistent elements which come through but it seems it’s largely dependent on context. 

First, the consistent elements. I’ll start with a writer I consider bad. Michael Polanyi was in current parlance a physical chemist who lost his way when he gravitated to topics in economics and philosophy. His philosophical ideas on science were a precursor to Kuhn’s historical analysis of the development of science, so we should certainly thank Polanyi for that. And maybe his ideas would have been more accepted had he written them in a more inviting language. 

I’ll start with a passage from Polanyi’s essay “Knowing and Being” 

The knowing of a disease is doubly unspecifiable. (1) We cannot identify, let alone describe, a great number of the particulars which we are in fact noticing when we diagnose a case of the disease. (2) Though we can identify a case of the disease by its typical appearance, we cannot describe it adequately, and there are four closely related reasons for this. (a) We are ignorant (according to 1) of the unspecifiable particulars which would enter into the description. (b) The relation between particulars—even if they could all be identified—could be described only in vague terms which the expert alone would understand. (c) Our identification of a disease in any one instance comprehends unspecifiably as its particulars the whole range of cases which, in spite of their individual differences, we have identified in the past, and (d) it relies on this comprehension for the future identification of an unlimited number of further cases which might differ from those known before in an infinite variety of unexpected ways. This is it’s heuristic function.

Now, what is Polanyi saying here? Here’s my best attempt at a translation. Understanding a human disease cannot be reduced to knowing the specific symptoms which the disease manifests as. This is because when a disease is diagnosed, we cannot always identify everything we’re using to diagnose the disease; rather, our diagnosis in a specific case might arise from some intuitive knowledge of similar cases. Thus it is difficult to completely and unambiguously document the features which give rise to a disease. (a) This is because we don’t know specifically all the features which we should use to describe the disease. (b) Even if we did know all of the features of the disease, the relationship between these features can only be vaguely described in a language only very experienced practitioners can understand. (c) Identifying a disease in a single case, requires us to apply our knowledge of many related, but, in actuality, different cases. (d) It assumes the future cases of the disease will be similar to the ones’ we used to identify/define the disease in the fist place. 

Many of these statements can be argued against (successfully, I think), but what makes such an argument difficult is the fact that the statements themselves are so difficult to understand. The information does not flow easily. The reader has to spend so much effort disentangling Polanyi’s convoluted syntax that there’s little energy remaining to see how the point of one paragraph or sentence is related to a larger point Polanyi’s trying to make.

Maybe this passage was written in another language and only appears convoluted to English ears. 

Polanyi’s constant use of ‘particulars’ and ‘specifiability’, as these are words he defines for his own purposes, is quite annoying. This is one example of what I consider bad writing: defining words for your argument and then presenting your entire argument in the language of those definitions. This not only appears circular—since you’re arguing the validity of your main point by assuming the validity of your definitions—but it is also cognitively difficult for the reader as he has to constantly refer back to your definitions in order to understand their use in a passage. 

I understand that new definitions are unavoidable when someone is trying to describe something which has never before been described. But in order for these definitions to be useful to the reader and for them to clarify rather than obfuscate one’s message, one should spend a longer amount of time discussing these definitions and applying them in examples and arguments which do not simply assume their validity. 

I think I have a sense of the tone he was trying to write in. Something professional and distant (although he does use a few personal examples to make his case), and hence something which would lend his work some credibility. I think his predecessor Kuhn did a much better job in writing in such a vein. 

Kuhn discusses many of the same topics that Polanyi does, but Kuhn’s writing is effervescent and clear while Polanyi’s is plodding and obfuscating. Take one of Kuhn’s passages explaining the relationship between scientists and their history

The temptation to write history backward is both omnipresent and perennial. But scientists are more affected by the temptation to rewrite history, partly because the results of scientific research show no obvious dependence upon the historical context of the inquiry, and partly because, except during crisis and revolution, the scientist’s contemporary position seems so secure. 


 The purpose of this experiment was to illustrate the main characteristics of Type I and Type II superconductors (SCs), namely the fall off of resistance below a critical temperature and the expulsion of net magnetic fields below a critical magnetic field at that temperature. We also demonstrated how Type II SCs are distinguished from Type I SCs by the partial penetration of magnetic fields into the interior of Type II SCs when they are above the first critical field value but below a second critical field value. We confirm the superconducting properties and Types of various known samples by studying them near their superconducting regime and plotting their magnetization as a function of applied field and resistance as a function of temperature. We also plot the critical magnetic field as a function of temperature, for each sample, to reproduce the characteristic $H_c \propto [1-(T/T_c)^2]}$ behavior. We repeat these measurements on an unknown sample to determine whether it is superconducting, and if so, whether it is Type I and Type II. The experimental arrangement required to conduct these tests is discussed and possible sources of error are outlined. We conclude by discussing experimental arrangements which could test additional characteristic effects of superconductivity. 


Baldwin, I am beginning to realize, employs a syntax (and I do think it’s specifically syntax and not diction) which hijacks the mind and makes it difficult to impose a logical rubric on what he’s writing. The hijacking occurs at an emotional level, and given that Baldwin’s work is personal memoir, I had always made allowances as to what justifies his rhetoric or conclusions. Baldwin, as a polemical writer in the parlance of Rand, relies on the reader’s personal feelings of disaffection to make his argument. When he says something like

Any real change implies the breakup of the world as one has always known it, the loss of all that gave one an identity, the end of safety. And at such a moment, unable to see and not daring to imagine what the future will now bring forth, one clings to what one knew, or thought one knew; to what one possessed or thought one possessed. Yet, is only when a man is able, without bitterness of self-pity, to surrender a dream he has long cherished or a privilege he has long possessed that he is set free—he has set himself free—for higher dreams, for greater privileges. (from “Faulkner and Desegregation”)

the language is captivating and you are moved. But you are partly moved because you recognize some feature of his description within your own life, and not because you agree with his logic. It is questionable whether this is a legitimate criticism. After all, much of fiction writing requires the reader impugning his own experience into the motivation of the characters. Why else would the same book, appear to have different meanings to us according to the times in our life when we read it?

Again by polemical, I mean that Baldwin often writes in declarative sentences with the structure “This is the way the world is” without any proof or argument as to why such declarations are true. For those who have already had experiences with his topics, one finds in Baldwin a truth and precision which is beautiful both because it is affirming and because it is posed in a language which is melodious. But I can imagine that those without such experiences thinking something is missing when they read him.  

Also Baldwin’s language is understated and this is principally what makes it devastating in its conclusions and lends it its power. For example, when reading Baldwin one sees categorical claims which are stated casually such as  

Any writer, I suppose, feels that the world into which he was born is nothing less than a conspiracy against the cultivation of his talent—which attitude certainly has a great deal to support it. On the other hand, it is only because the world looks on his talent with such a frightened indifference that the artist is compelled to make his talent important. (from the Introduction to Notes from a Native Son)

Baldwin errs on the ambiguous side of clarity, namely he is typically not specific in his discussion of anything. This not only allows him to make the general statements characteristic of any polemical writer, but it also serves to draw the reader into the work. The reader is so drawn in because the ambiguity, rather than creating confusion, creates a puzzle which demands solution. What is Baldwin trying to say, you ask yourself, and then your mind runs along seeking out both the meaning and implications of his words. Last quote from Giovanni’s room:

People who believe they are strong-willed and the masters of their destiny can only continue to believe this by becoming specialists in self-deception. Their decisions are not really decisions at all—a real decision makes one humble, one knows that it is at the mercy of more things than can be named—but elaborate systems of evasion, of illusion, designed to make themselves and the world appear to be what they are not. (Giovanni’s Room)

On the whole I think Baldwin’s is an incredibly effective style of writing because it accomplishes the principle aim of any writing: To move the reader and to make one believe a change has been affected through the clarifying and articulating of things one has always tacitly felt.

Yoshino’s style in this article is very distant and one could say he is ‘clinical’ in his use of language and in the way he analyzes the existence of bisexual erasure and the arguments, implicit or explicit, for the erasure’s support in heterosexual and homosexual communities. 



I have to admit I most enjoyed Bloykin’s writing when he moved out of the mode of a journalist and into a more Baldwinian tone. This fact of course suggests I have a personal bias with regard to quality of writing. 


But one issue I had with Bloykin’s work was his periodic inundation of examples. At one time to reveal how the news media mischaracterized an early story on the AIDS epidemic he went in detail through half a dozens news paper articles, all of which said essentially the same wrong thing. I at times wanted to grab the narrator by the lapels, shake him a few times and yell into his face “I get it already! Please move-the-fuck on!” 


Schmidt attempts the clandestine polemical stance, but is more transparent about it, and I suppose he can be since his stance is supported by logical arguments and evidence.

Gödel’s Theorem
I always wanted to understand this theorem, now I am someways towards doing so. Here is a quote of a quote from How Mathematicians Think which tries to explain it. 

Gödel’s incompleteness proof is very clever. It’s very paradoxical. It almost looks crazy. Gödel starts in effect with the paradox of the liar: the statement “I’m false!” which is neither true nor false. Actually what Gödel does is to construct a statement that says of itself, “I’m unprovable!” Now if you can construct such a statement…in arithmetic …you’re in trouble. Why? Because if that statement is provable, it is by necessity false, and you’re proving false results. If it’s unprovable, as it says of itself, then its true and mathematics is incomplete. 
—Gregory Chaitin

This explanation confused me initially, because there was some ambiguity in how to interpret “I’m unprovable!” I thought it was saying something like “The statement A is unprovable” in which case we could prove this larger statement to be true without any violation of logic. But if we were to prove statement A, then we would have to reject our initial claim or admit to having a contradiction in mathematics. 

I don’t think the explanation is saying this however. Rather it’s saying “This statement is unprovable”. In which case, if we prove that what is in the quotation marks is unprovable then the statement is false and we just proved true what is actually false, so we have an inconsistency. But if the statement is indeed unprovable, then we label mathematics as incomplete. 

The titular question, and perhaps the resolution of the ambiguity, comes from determining where exactly the initial statement comes from and whether we can take it to be cardinal truth. To determine this we might have to look more carefully at the proof.

**
We could actually combine both interpretations if we take A = “This statement is unprovable”. In which case if we were able to prove A, we would have to reject the initial claim “The statement A is unprovable” because it arises out of a system of logic which is inconsistent, since proving A contradicts A itself.  If we couldn’t prove A, then the claim “The statement A is unprovable” is true and mathematics is incomplete.
**

The simpler example of Gödel’s statement comes from an analysis of “This statement is false”. In what follows “statement” refers to everything that is italicized

This statement is false. 

Is this statement true or false? If it is true, then by the words of the statement it must be false. But if we find that the statement is false, then we are corroborating precisely what the statement says, which must mean it is true. Hence, we must conclude it is neither true nor false. There are statements then which can neither be proven true nor be proven false. 

What makes such statements so confusing is that they are metalogical, that is they concern the logic of logic. In other words, unlike other most logico-deductive procedures which flow information from one point to another, these statements take some information and return that information to its source. Rather, than being other-referential, they are self-referential.

Paradoxes typically result from our limited sense of the possibilities of mathematical or physical contexts. The paradox above in a way arises primarily in the assumptions of the question. By asking whether the statement is true or false, we are in essence assuming that statements can either be true or false. The resolution of the paradox forces us to enlarge our ideas of how to label the truth of statements.

Baldwin Quotes

“People are continually pointing out to me the wretchedness of white people in order to console me for the wretchedness of blacks. But an itemized account of the American failure does not console me and it should not console anyone else.”
— Baldwin “Fifth Avenue, Uptown”

“The determined will is rare…and the inequalities suffered by the many are in no way justified by the rise of a few. A few have always risen—in every country, every era, and in the teeth of regimes which can by no stretch of the imagination be thought of as free.”
— Baldwin “Fifth Avenue, Uptown”

“Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them. They must, they have no other models. This is exactly what our children are doing. They are imitating our immorality, our disrespect for the pain of others.”
—Baldwin “Fifth Avenue, Uptown”

“Northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury. They seem to feel that because they fought on the right side during the Civil War, and won, they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going on in the South, without taking any responsibility for it;”
— Baldwin “Fifth Avenue, Uptown”

“As far as the color problem is concerned, there is but one great difference between the Southern white and the Northerner: the Southerner remembers, historically and in his own psyche, a kind of Eden in which he loved black people and they loved him”
— Baldwin “Fifth Avenue, Uptown”

“It is a terrible, an inexorable, law that one cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one’s own: in the face of one’s victim, one sees oneself.”
— Baldwin “Fifth Avenue, Uptown”

New Structure of Learning - Add to “Infrastructure Notes”; Writing Modules
To make modules easier to write, and to ensure that they are well motivated you should begin each with why you’re writing it (what you want to learn and why you want to learn it/what you think it’ll help you better understand). And then create a list of terms relevant to the module. You’ll then define these terms and provide mathematical/physical examples of them. Possibly even riff problems off these terms. Then you can produce the crux of the Module (pretty much everything we previously described as relevant to it). At the end you can construct an extension/gateway problem which allows you to use the techniques of the module in an new context. 

Here’s a summary of the aspects of said Module

1. Why: Why you’re learning it; What questions it answers; Why these questions are important
2. List of Terms: List of 6-10 words defined and discussed which are relevant to module. 
3. Module Crux: Main techniques/formalism of module
4. Gateway Problem: Extension problem at the end to let you apply techniques to a new system

Order and Disorder in Work
I have too many running projects and I am not making noticeable progress to any of them. Worst still, when I do complete something I can’t help but feel a sense of emptiness and loss, as though all the work were for nought. This in turn makes it more difficult for me to be motivated to complete then next piece of work. 

So my working habits are disorganized and when I manage to organize them, I find it pointless to do so. This is the problem. I’m unfocused and periodically descend into a futilitarian philosophy. I don’t know what the solution is, but I have a few ideas for work arounds. 

One idea is old: before I begin a new project I should specify “The Why”, namely what I hope to achieve by completing the project. This would be good to state early on because it could help ensure that I’m not doing work out of the common reasons of insecurity and restlessness. It is often these reasons which lead to the feeling unfulfilled by the projects I complete. I need to ask myself, when I finish a project will it sit unused and unread in a folder or will it act as the foundation to something else? In other words,  I need to have a concrete reason for each topic I start to learn or each project I begin. This “why” is what will keep me focused (I hope) in the quiet days when I feel completely empty and directionless. 

The second idea comes from last year: I should create a precise working schedule for my projects. This working schedule should extend into many weeks/months and for each week I should state what I should accomplish. 

The last idea is perhaps common sense: I’m not making reasonable progress to my projects because I simply have too many projects. Perhaps then I should limit my project work to three (or even fewer) per month. 

For this month the three projects are The Fountainhead and the Fraternity, Thoughts on Renyi Annealing, and The Other Man. An essay, a technical project, and a short story. This in of itself is probably too much work, but we’ll see how it goes.

Claustrophobia of High Energy Physics
By not seeing HEP as definitive of a boundary beyond which you cannot pass, see it as just another subject in physics. This perspective will  not only free you from the cognitive block which prevents you from learning it (for fear of becoming trapped within it) but it will also allow you to use it most effectively by seeing how it is connected to phenomena and methodology to which it makes no reference.

Fields of Physics Notes: Cosmology
Cosmology is the study of the universe at large. It attempts to determine/answer questions about how the universe began and of how it grows and develops. Physical cosmology is concerned with the physical laws which govern the origin, evolution, and fate of the universe. Religious cosmology is concerned with various theological creation narratives for the universe. 

Cosmology differs from astronomy, in that while the latter deals with specific celestial objects, the latter deals with the universe macroscopically. 

Key Terms: 
Big Bang
Inflation 
Nucleosynthesis
Robertson-Walker Metric
Steady-State Cosmology 
Red-Shift
Cosmic Microwave Background
Friedman Metric, 

Foundational Subjects: Quantum Field Theory, General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Thermodynamics/Statistical Physics

The Missing Curriculum

There is something which feels existentially hopeless/empty about working through a long set of decontextualized technical exercises. I experienced such despair last year when I was learning python. Each chapter had half a dozen rather simple exercises which allowed you to practice the material you had just learned. In this sense the reason for the exercises was manifest, but I still felt something was missing. What was the larger justification for this work? Why did I have to do it? In my mind rang the petulant remarks of a child forced to sit down at a desk and work through sheets of multiplication tables. These remarks boiled down simply to Why?

Of course to those of us who managed to emerge mostly unscathed from this experience the reason is clear. Working through such exercises allows you to build up a technical language which can be employed with facility and ease as you learn higher order concepts. Working through multiplication tables, makes learning algebra easier. Working through calculus exercises, makes learning physics easier. 

This is the classical purpose of a technical education. To provide the student with a language which frames his or her world and makes it easier to engage with it on a more precise and more sophisticated plane. But there is a gap in this education, a gap revealed in what it professes to teach and what it actually does. 

—
There is something which feels existentially empty about working through a long set of decontextualized exercises. Many student first encounter such despair in the multiplication tables which are drilled in early mathematics education. I personally experienced it a few years ago when I was learning python from an online text (How to Think Like a Computer Scientist). Each chapter in the text had about a dozen rather simple exercises which allowed the reader to immediately practice the discussed material. In this sense the reason for the exercises and all such exercises was manifest. But still, working through them felt dry and tedious.

Working through such exercises allows you to build up a technical language that can be deployed with facility and rigor as you learn and build so called higher order skills. For example, working through multiplication tables, trivializes the multiplication tasks in algebra so you can focus on the abstraction of solving for a unknown variable. Knowing how to differentiate and integrate simple functions, reduces the cognitive load which may be present when studying physics so that the student can focus on the physical context separate from the mathematics. 

And in this perspective on the purpose of a technical language and the exercises which build proficiency in ti lies the classical purpose of a technical education. 

Here in lies the classical purpose of an education. To provide the student with a language which over time colors/frames/hues/changes his or her world and makes it possible to better engage with that world on a more precise and informed plane. The way such an education is most often conveyed to a physics student is through problem solving, (and  (JUMP) (JUMP) but there is in fact a gap in such an education. 

A physics education is geared to do expressly that by making the student cognizant of the physical principles and laws which govern phenomena most people take for granted. Moreover in the absence of any specific vocation a physics major trains one for, the education physics provides is professed to teach students how to solve problems. 

The problems and general structure of physics education are antithetical to the professed utiltity and aims of that education. Namely, besides the subject/content knowledge of physics this education provides, it also claims to provide students with instruction in how to solve problems. But the second goal is often not fully achieved due to a misguided focus on only a single aspect of the problem solving process, and because subject based knowledge is most effectively developed through solving problems, the first goal is often missed as well. 

and in the absence of any increased earning potential such a major could provide, one of the main stated draws for majoring in physics is the way the major teaches students to solve problems.

Letter to Devon

Devon,

This email comes much too late. A lateness extending primarily from my ambivalence as to its necessity. You will of course remember the event. Weeks after the final exam for Harvard’s summer physics course, Louis contacted me about a student’s parent. This mother was dismayed that a TA would so callously inform her daughter that she shouldn’t be taking the physics course she was already taking. Worst still this TA made the declaration days away from the student’s final exam, thus damaging the student’s self esteem at a time when she needed it most. 

Then, of course, Louis told me I was this TA and you were the student. I was surprised at this. I remembered our last tutoring session, but beyond the physics problems we discussed I could remember little else. Did I really say what I was accused (not the right word, but I can’t think of any else) of saying?

On my end, I don’t remember saying that you shouldn’t be where you so clearly already were, and if you heard words to that effect, they were certainly misinterpreted. How could I conclusively say whether or not you should take a course you wanted to take? It is your life, isn’t it? Throughout high school, and college, and even into graduate school I have encountered too many well-intentioned people who have given me "good advice" which I nevertheless had to ignore because their counsel had more to do with how they wanted to live their lives than with anything they really knew about mine. How then could I sit across from you and in good faith give you advice in the same vein?

So I hesitated to apologize, because if an apology was all I was giving you it was really unnecessary. The exam and the class were over and the incident clearly boiled down to a misunderstanding, so surely there was no reason to bring it up again. 

But I am bringing it up again because I now realize it has nuances that I did not completely appreciate at the start. First, the easy: regardless of whatever grade you received in the physics class, no one had any right to tell you you shouldn’t take it. 

Second, the not so easy:

A week ago my sister who is an optical engineer told me that she had a recent experience with a professor who refused to provide constructive comments on her work and yet constantly criticized her for the work’s supposedly shoddy quality. Contradictions in his comments eventually made her realize he wasn’t actually reading what she was writing, but simply giving her the grades he “felt” she should get. Now I can’t assume too much about the character of this professor, but what seems clear is that something was preventing him from really seeing the student before him. Something seemed to make it necessary to replace this student with a caricature which, although wholly inaccurate, was much easier to deal with.

Currently you are young and as a result so called “adults” will try to protect you from the truth of the world, hoping you will come to it when you are good and ready. But when I was young the dreams that adults kept telling me were reality constantly contradicted the reality I saw everyday, so not only did I learn to distrust figures of authority, but I also had to learn on my own everything I could have learned much sooner if adults were just more honest. 

So I will be honest with you. I do not know too much about world, but I do know it is filled to the brim with ignorance, and it is an ignorance which is particularly toxic because it exists and is meted out so passively. It is an ignorance which our culture today accurately sequesters into racism, sexism, xenophobia, etc., but it can also exist between such labels. Much of my life has been spent dodging the life-course and psychological repercussions of such ignorance, and such maneuvering is the universal burden—which exists simultaneously as a privilege—for all people who refuse to accept at face value the labels other people apply to them. 

And now, because you were a girl in a physics class, I recognize the need to urge you to constantly engage in that refusal.

There is nothing special about a girl taking physics other than the fact that America is so bent on maintaining the tautological cultural narrative which claims such an event is noteworthy. As a result, if you continue to take physics classes (or math classes, or engineering classes, or really any class that requires a knowledge of the rudiments of algebra), you’ll be confronted with peers who disregard your perfectly sensible comments, teachers who treat good questions as though they were annoyances, and administrators who try to channel you towards more “comfortable” course trajectories. 

These people may sneer at you, they may totally ignore you, and they may even smile, but the facts of their actions are the same: These people do not know anything about you. Indeed, because they know so little about you but are so adamantly sure that they do, one can infer they also know very little about themselves. And so you cannot (or must not) internalize their vision of you as something which truly describes who you are. The hierarchies of power in this country are insidious, widespread, and ever deepening, but their most tragic effect is the way they make so called “marginalized people” truly believe they themselves embody the characteristics everyone claims they do. 

Thus, in combatting such hierarchies and the people who perpetuate them, your one power is not to accept what any of these people say about you. That is, your power exists in your self knowledge; seeing yourself, your abilities, and aptitudes in a way wholly independent of how the culture sees you. Such is a vision many people would categorize as delusional, but in reality it is the only thing that can save you from their uninformed disapproval. 

So this is why I had to write the email: If something I could only imagine saying obliquely and with no malice could so aversely affect you, how would you fair when other people intentionally try to tell you who you are and what you’re capable of accomplishing?

If it is helps you to practice opposing such people, please group me with them and allow me to be an example of how wrong they are. Even with seven months gone from the event, my hope is that the experience can still do some good. 

I will not lie to you; You could have much done better in PS2. But, regardless of your final grade you stayed in the course until the end, in spite of its difficulty, and continued to work even when some people would have seen no point in doing so. More than anything, this demonstrates agency. I hope it is this agency which will help you build the self knowledge to confidently ignore any TA who seems to tell you what course you should or should not be taking. 

-Mobolaji

 
If there is any good I can do in this world it is to convince people of the agency they already have. 

I don’t know a lot about the world, but I do know it is filled to the brim with a toxic yet often passive ignorance, which keeps so called marginalized peoples in “their place” and keeps them believing they should be there. Much of my life has been spent dancing away from the effects of that ignorance, and my decision to study physics has much to do with the fact that it contends with a world apart from the social institutions which perpetuate many of the virulent ideas about the world. 


Baba: Ibukun o ti dagba. Omokunrin o ti ya l’ati n’iyawo. Emi naa fe. ní omo-omo

Yoruba Proverb To ómodé ’ bá tó l’ókó a fun l’ókó; t’ómodé bá tó l’ ada, a fún un l’ada. = When a child can use a hoe, you give him a hoe, when a child is old enough to use a machete you give him a machete

I have to pause to question the truth of that statement. It was certainly the second time I was out with a guy in a capacity in which both us believed what we’re doing might lead to something more. That was certainly a date in any sense of the definition. But I also went out with Hugo, and with Cheng. I don’t think they would call what we did a date, because of course how would they know how I felt about them?

Tuesday March 29, 2016 - Cabot Science Center
Untitled 01
Last Sunday I went on my second date with a guy. The first date was about a month ago with David, a chemist turned computational programmer of 38 who grew up in China. I never documented that date, and I’m not sure why. I was nervous throughout, but nothing happened. We sat in a coffee shop, awkwardly speaking to each other, before walking around Boston Commons. We took the redline together back to Cambridge and he got off at the stop on Central. We gave each other a cordial and non physical goodbye, and although we tried to schedule some things afterwards we haven’t met up again.

But my date this Sunday with Tony was surreal, less for the fact that it was happening, and more for what specifically was happening between us. Apologies. I should be more clear; that description lends the situation a romantic tinge it did not have. What it did have “in spades” so to speak was atypicality, something which gave me the sense that I was entering a space of experience I had never encountered before. 

He’s texted me every day since the night we first met, and at first I thought this was annoying. Why doesn’t he assume that he’s bothering me? Is it because I’m always polite enough to respond? But really what should I expect? Sometimes life is as simple as it presents itself to be. People talk to the people they like to talk to. Not everyone is as tightly controlled as I am, not everyone as incredibly inhibited.

It was perhaps five minutes after we sat down in the movie theatre, before the movie ever began, and before the second preview, when he leaned towards me and asked it was OK if we held hands. Was it OK? I wasn’t sure. Gay relationships are so much more accepted now that it is not rare to see guys strolling the street, admittedly mainly at night, hand in hand. It’s what two people did when they cared about each other and when they wanted to remain close and connected even in the midst of strangers. So yes, in some abstract space, totally disconnected from me and my own actions, it was OK. But right now, here in the movie theatre, with me as an actor and not an observer, was it still OK? In truth, I did not care whether we did it, but, as I told him, we had just met. How, possibly, could the basis of affection which motivates such an act have been built in the less than 30 minutes we had seen each other? He interpreted my resistance differently. “Are you shy?” he asked. I suppose in general I was (and I am), but I think he was asking something much more specific. Something those in this gay community—a community in which I never thought I would be so entrenched as to have a personal knowledge of their language—would call “discreet”. He was asking if were we ever to actually form a relationship, would I be the guy who in public would walk two feet apart from him, hands in pocket, staring unsmilingly at the world, or would I be the guy who walks him to his bus stop in broad day light, hugging him all the way, and gives him a long kiss good bye in front of the bus’s passengers and, for all intents and purposes, the world. 

“No, I’m not shy” I told him, not really knowing if it was true. I tried to explain my apprehension again, but he just smiled. The point turned out to be moot. When the movie began he took my hand anyway, and began rubbing my fingers with his thumb. It was weird, yes, and I guess the entire point of this essay is to interrogate why I thought it was so weird, why I felt so uncomfortable when I had believed for so long this was exactly what I wanted. 

At one point, he told me he thought I was cute. I am ashamed to say how good it felt to hear that from someone. I thought I had long ago disabused myself of any psychological dependence on such a plain and superficial form of objectification, but I smiled nevertheless. My smile was different when he said rather directly that he really liked me. I laughed, not believing it, and felt compelled to reveal to him that he didn’t believe it either. “We just met,” I told him, “You don’t even know me.” He seemed to think this was a small detail. I eventually, and not at all in a way which was self-serving, got him to list the things he claimed to like. The list was not terribly flattering, and seemed to have less to do with me, than with his own tepid experience dating other guys. I was reserved, he said. I didn’t want to have sex immediately. I was clearly not a psychopath.

He told me these things right before I returned home for the night, while we were in his car in the nearly empty Stop and Shop parking lot. I chose the location because it was close to my home, and yet far enough away that he wouldn’t know exactly where I lived. But it was late, and his car was only one of two there. It looked sketchy, and again I found myself in a space of reality that I never thought I would occupy: At night, in a car with a guy I just met, a guy who was now doing things to me he could not do in broad day light. Now before your imagination runs in all matter of directions, let me clarify. He wanted to feel my stomach and my chest, compelled, I guess, by the images displayed on my profile. I let him do so, already so far from a reality I recognized and felt comfortable in that I could no longer intuit the standards of conduct by which, hours before, I had lived my life. 

It was also in this car that he told me he was from Bangkok. And all of a sudden, my mind was drawn to him and the relationship we might have if only for the literary implications. A Nigerian american, who has never been to Nigeria, and is in the process of “coming to terms with his sexuality”, dates a guy from Thailand. I mean, really, what a confluence of sexuality and race. I would not have had the balls, the imagination, nor the follow through to conjure up a premise so titillating. And yet here was reality reminding me once again that whatever I may achieve could only ever be second-rate, for the world was the true raconteur. 

I was mostly passive throughout the entire night, not really knowing what to do or what was acceptable. So in everything he took the initiative, and he did all the things dating websites have told me I should do, but which I could never bring myself to do, when I was with girls I was attracted to. He simply showed through actions and words which expressed the intent to act, that he liked me. He said things I could never imagine saying, things so manifestly naked in their expression of vulnerability and desire that I had long ago trained myself not to even acknowledge the feelings which led to them. “Can we hold hands?”, “Can I drive you home? I’d like to talk some more.” “Can I kiss you?” These things were strange to hear. Partly because they were directed at me. Partly because a guy was saying it. And partly because they were being said at all. 

Of course, I could generalize this, and say this is really just what happens when you give men full access to the range of intimacies available to a human being. But for now, I’ll just say this is something particular to Tony. 

And yet I couldn’t believe in anything he said or did, and I couldn’t imagine how I might begin to do so. It was wholly unfamiliar to try to accept someone else’s vision of me as valid and true in someway of myself. For much of my life, my sense of self, my entire identity was predicated on rejecting all the ways people had failed to see me. It had been so necessary to waking up each day and simply moving about and within the world that it had nearly become reflexive. And here was someone who clearly saw me in a way completely different from the way I saw myself, and I was contemplating accepting his vision because for once this external perspective was a positive one. 

But through it all, while the seconds passed by slow and dream-like, I personally felt nothing. Sitting next to him in the movie theatre, walking with him on Tremont street, or driving with him in his car, I felt neither the rush of hope which comes from the potential of a new relationship, nor basic lust. Next to him I felt what I had felt when I was in Gbemisola’s room in November of last year. 

Gbemisola and I had seen each other, I think, spontaneously at the Du Bois meet and greet, and I guilt tripped her into finally seeing the movie (any movie really) we had made plans to see all semester. But after the event, I could clearly see that she was tired, so I said we could watch a movie another time. Her room was on the third floor of Conant, and we discussed the issue back and forth all the way up. In her room she sat on her bed, and we talked. I talked about the books on her shelf, one of which was Chimamanda Adichie’s Americanah. “I haven’t finished it,” she told me. She said she didn’t plan to. She thought it was boring. After some time, I decided to leave. It was not late, but we weren’t going to watch a movie tonight, so what would be the point of staying? For some reason, it did not occur to me that I was carrying my messenger bag and that if we really wanted to watch something—or rather, if I really wanted to watch something—we could just use my laptop. And of course, since the first thought never entered my head, I also never entertained the natural second thought which I am considering now, namely that if watching a movie together on my laptop signaled an intimacy greater than any that could be experienced in a theatre, why couldn’t I, or why did I refuse to, see it?

“Are you sure?” she asked me, her large eyes steadily gazing into mine. Did I seem uncertain? Sometimes I fall into this state of flustered stuttering which makes me seem much less sure of myself than I am. I often use the state strategically, almost exclusively on women, to become disarming and soften my typically intense manner. But in front of Gbemisola, the state came without volition. In her presence, I always felt like a child. She was ever calm and serene and spoke slowly in a voice that sounded more like England than Nigeria. So maybe that’s what was happening now. Maybe she was reading the insecurity she had always induced in me. 

“I’m sure,” I said trying to give a convincing smile, which I’m sure only came off as uncomfortable. But she wasn’t satisfied.

“Are you sure?” she asked again. It was the same question, but this time it sounded like a warning. My response the first time was automatic, but for this one I hesitated. I looked at her, her eyes still and quiet and waiting. She was on the edge of the bed. I didn’t know what was happening. 

Gbemisola is incredibly pretty. When she speaks, she often does so unemotionally, in what I would call a monotone if there was anything langorous about it. Instead, it was always clear, always crisp, and unconsciously I found myself asking her questions just to hear her voice. Her frame does not reflect the Western world’s ideals of what a woman’s body looks like in its optimal form, but independent of the imposed perspective I recognize in her an undeniable sexual vibrance. And I felt this most intensely, if at all vaguely, right after she asked the question a second time. 

After she spoke something quiet in me recognized the potential in this situation, but something not at all quiet, but loud and strong, responded immediately at the intimation. Because although Gbemisola was stately and beautiful, and she made me nervous and jittery, I could not imagine what anything more would look like between us. I smiled at her against effort, recognizing something awkward was about to transpire. 

“I’m sure,” I said a second time. She sighed and she got up and looked away from me, disappointed, more so in me, it seemed, than in a night which would now be unrealized. She walked me to her door, and I left. As I walked down the stairs I got the sense, a sense which to this moment has proven to be accurate, that this would be the last time I would be visiting Gbemisola in her room. 

Was all this because Gbemisola was a girl? Such an explanation is the foundation of the standard coming out story, right? Something I’m sure you’ve heard before. Poor little Billie can’t get it up for Alice, because Billie really wants Bobby. This is what I had entertained, an idea comfortable at the very least for the solidarity it immediately induces in you. Suddenly, your story is the story of so many other people. Suddenly, your affliction is their affliction. 

But at the end of my night with Tony, on the precipice of finally realizing a dream I had always wanted, it was gradually dawning on me, that I perhaps did not want to realize it at all, that this dream was actually two steps removed from reality—a dream of a dream, if you will—and what I had always wanted was simply, but really not so simply, what I had only believed I wanted. 

Recently it has begun to make increasing sense why I am so attracted to theoretical physics. It’s the abstraction of it, an abstraction masquerading as physical relevance. I can pretend that I am engaging with the world, while only choosing to do so in a rarefied exclusively intellectual plane where I do not have to make visceral contact with it. I think my fantasies and ideas about relationships and what such relationships could mean to me occupied a similar space. Nebulous, romantic in the least romantic way, these ideas were safe and valuable as long as they were unrealized. For if the world came close and gave me even a glimpse of what I claimed I needed, the dream would be supplanted with a reality which could not support the weight of my insecurities and could not be as easily manipulated and was thus, inevitably, much less useful to me than the dream itself.

And this recognition is troubling, because it will force me to relinquish beliefs I have made foundational to that thing called identity. If you discover that what you want and have always wanted in the world has no foundation in reality and is based entirely on a fantasy, you must then recognize that you as a human being do not need what you have always wanted, and you also ultimately must question why you so fervently believed you did.

Still, I remember a time not at all long ago when I felt a loneliness so black and consuming, that its alleviation seemed to be as necessary to living as removing a noose from one’s neck is to breathing. My natural inclinations towards cynicism lead me now to interpret this change in myself as fundamental and irreversible. It seems that one of the tragic things about wanting things is that we almost never get the things we want when we so desperately need them. Rather, these things always seem to try to enter our lives after we have found ways to live without them or after we no longer have the space for them.  

But perhaps I just don’t like Tony. I remember sitting next to Hugo in a subway cart a few months ago, smiling like a child who has just been told she’ll be spending the day in Disney land instead of at school. At that moment, if Hugo were to turn to me and whisper into my ear that he wanted to kiss me, is it true that I would have turned away recognizing that I never really liked him and was instead merely infatuated with the “idea of him”? Even my deep and experienced cynicism isn’t strong enough for me to believe that. So although a realization of my asexuality is an attractive narrative for this night, I have to conclude that I just don’t like Tony. 

And even this isn’t something I can say with finality because for all the things I do not understand about love and that strange indefinable connection which materializes between two people, what is clear about it is that it can grow. This has happened to me repeatedly over the years and even though I say that I know myself and believe I can anticipate the rush and warmth of it, I so often find that I have been subdued by it long before I have acknowledged that it exists. Christine, Fred, Stephan, Jessica. I had told myself things about my relationships with these people, things totally contrary to the ultimate realization of my feelings for them. So, yes, take what I say now with a grain of salt.

But there is still something about me which I know can create and remain as a wall between us. At one point, looking rather deliberately for material for a future story, I asked him if he has ever had a one-night stand and how he felt about them.

Now, I should mention the question was silly for a number of reasons. For one, how would I know if his answer was the truth, but for two, and primarily, the entire notion of “one-night stand” is such an artifact of cultural parochialism that it exists as a striking example of what post-modernist sociological theory claims is wrong with our definitions, that is it represents a reality of our relationships which is almost entirely constructed in the minds of a small collection of people and really has no connection to the world independent of our biases. To ask the question and to fail to recognize the uselessness of it is to fail to see a distinction between one’s own experiences and the experiences the culture claims everyone shares. Because if I do spend a single night with someone and never see them again, but it is a night I remember and one that I wish desperately will happen again, would I be willing to call the night, true to its definition, a “one-night stand”? Will the dirty and shameful connotations of the phrase, which are true only in a denotative sense, mesh with what I had actually lived through? Would it be faithful to how I experienced reality?

But Tony didn’t answer the question. In a response I should have anticipated, he turned the question back on me asking what was my experience with ‘one-night stands’. I hesitated to tell him the truth, that I had never had a one-night stand, that I had never even had sex. I delayed responding to his question, choosing to tell him the answer only in the last 15 minutes of our meeting, so that if he judged me as harshly as I judged myself for this gap of experience, I at least wouldn’t have to sit with his judgment throughout the night.

“I’m a virgin,” I told him, embarrassed both for the fact of the statement and the fact I couldn’t say it without shame. 

Light disbelief was his response, before finally deciding I must be telling the truth. “This explains a lot,” he told me. I wanted to ask him what, possibly, could it explain for I had been trying and failing for years to find any such explanation.

There are many stories associated with male virginity, stories which make me severely uncomfortable because I recognize so much personal truth in them. I, for the longest time, was a misanthrope in action if not in professed philosophy, and early experiences with women taught me how incredibly dangerous being in love was, the way being in love enslaves you to the character and whims of compassion of another person. And of course I was socially awkward, and made up for this awkwardness with a technical competency my peers marveled at. At my disposal were all the cultural and psychological explanations for sexual inhibition. I could use Freud’s ideas on sublimation, contemplate the possibility of asexuality, or simply see myself as a late bloomer. In short, there were many comfortable stories to occupy and through them I felt the warmth of comprehension. And it would have been enough to quell the shame of the identity, if only the very experience of it was not so intensely and inescapably lonely. 

He asked me why, as in “Why have you never had sex?” It was a natural question, I suppose, but it was also one that was decidedly strange to hear because the very premise of it suggested an agency in this direction I never felt I had. I told him it wasn’t really a choice; the opportunity just never came up. He didn’t completely believe this, and, in the moment, I realized as well that it was not entirely true. 

You create images in your head for how events will present themselves when they finally enter your life, and all the opportunities which seem to bear the outlines of these events are parsed through the lens of your prior prejudice. Often you encounter these opportunities in garbs entirely different from what you envisioned, and if you’re unable to relinquish your initial vision and the ignorance which elicited it, you can fail to see these moments for what they are, as things you have always wanted from the world. It requires a superhuman effort to appreciate and truly see the reality before your eyes, to let go of the dreams you always possessed and which have always possessed you.

I remember nights at Nu Delta, nights which I have always felt could only turn out the way they did, but which currently seem to shimmer and twinkle in my memory with a possibility that now of course can never be fulfilled. A girl who put her head on my shoulder as we sat together at a pub night. A girl who laughed and admitted that she was indeed “trying to take advantage of me” by trying to get me to drink. 

But one night comes back to me and keeps coming back to me because it seemed to forewarn so much about me and my relationship with a particular person. It was during my junior year, the night of Nu Delta’s Winter Formal. I had just completed my tenure as pledge trainer and I was on the verge of finally coming to the end of a year replete with trials. I felt free in a way I had not felt in a long time, and better still my date that night was Jessica. Jessica who was beautiful and whose kindness and empathy seemed not at all to be affected by the world’s inordinate value of that beauty. I had found she was incredibly easy to talk to, and her lightness and conviviality softened something in me. What’s more I intuited the sense she had felt the same way. I had looked at her and she seemed to be truly and calmly looking back. 

At the end of the night it was too late for her to take a bus back home to Wellesley, so I said she could stay in my room. But I wanted to make it clear that I wouldn’t try anything, that this wasn’t a ploy for something more; I told her she would sleep in my loft and I would sleep on the couch below. In short I wanted to show her that I was the “perfect gentleman”, the thing I and all the world had told me to be, but what I realize now is that was really just a pretext to excuse myself from the responsibility of my feelings. 

She accepted the arrangement and she climbed up to the loft alone. On the couch I imagined what it would be like to be up there with her, to place a palm on her stomach, a hand between her thighs. But I stayed where I was, and in the morning I walked with her to the bus stop, hugged her good bye, and watched the Peter Pan bus as it drove away. 

I called her a month later, and we met and weeks after that we danced at Nu Delta’s party and weeks later we danced again. And yet beyond this, nothing happened. Each time I saw her I fell increasingly and dangerously more in love, but I kept trying my best to hide this fact from her. At the time I didn’t know how much I was succeeding.

In August of my senior year, I told her over the phone that I liked her, and she told me she never knew I felt that way, but that she had always thought of me as a friend. Months later someone told me she was dating Makai, but I only truly believed it when I saw them at the Fall Formal. I had stood up from my seat to carry my and my date’s plate to the kitchen, when I saw her with him. They were in the hallway blocking my path to the kitchen, and she was kissing him—and it was really her kissing him—passionately and without any of that nonsense of feminine restraint. At that moment, I felt like I was seeing everything in the room in slow motion. Her hands were gripping his neck. His arms were wrapped around her waist. I was standing there holding plates of steak and rice, watching them both. 

I had never felt pain so clean and so unambiguously present. I was suddenly breathless, and I turned away from the kitchen and instead walked upstairs in a stupor, wondering if I had entered a dream. More than anything else, I felt betrayed, a feeling I now recognize as horribly misguided for I had long ago betrayed myself.

Jessica is important for this reason: She represented the culmination of a habit that had been years in the making. The habit of telling myself other people were the way they were, and I was the way I was, and beyond some point—which I always encountered eventually—the two were immiscible. Quite simply. I believed I could not connect with people, even when I desperately wanted to. The notion was narcissistic, but I believed it in order to protect myself from the apparent fact of my lack of control. I had believed it, had spent so long believing that it could be no other way, that my actions were subject to forces and laws of identity I could not change. Needless to say, this claim was a narrative, and like many narratives by which people live their lives, its truth existed primarily in my scrupulous fidelity to it and not to its reflection of anything inevitable in the world.

What was the source of my emotional estrangement? Why have I so carefully and deliberately closed myself up? The precise reasons are not clear, but I know it began with Christine, was tempered by Fred and then by Stephan, and with Lesley reached a point of crystallization beyond which I never thought it could proceed. Until I met Jessica, and with her I felt that the change I had experienced was a change which would last for ever. And this indeed has been true, because I have forced it to be true, for the past five years.

So there I sat with Tony, slowly realizing that my failure to establish sexually intimate relationships with other people existed both as a choice and a sentence. I was silent, and in that silence he told me what I, like a teenager, had always wanted to hear from someone: That he wanted me, and that he was sure other people did as well. And through such words, my agency, which I guess had been there from the beginning, was revealed to me. I could no longer pretend that the world had conspired and always will conspire to deny me that particular aspect of the human experience. 

Now, I find myself on the edge of change, a change which can take me in one of two directions, each direction comprising either side of a contradictory dichotomy of identity by which I have so constantly managed to see myself. Either my loneliness and this clear sense that I’m being denied a necessary intimacy is false and inauthentic, and I really do not want an intimate—defined almost exclusively along sexual lines—connection with a person. Or the desire for intimacy is real, and all the things I have told myself about my inability to connect with people—and the fringe benefits such an inability provides—is false, and it is truly possible for me to love someone, and show that love in reality and not merely in my head. These really have been the two modes by which I have seen my life and viewed the actors who pass through it. Choosing one will force me to abandon the other, and thus to also abandon all of the associated ways I have used that identity to understand, and yet also to protect me from, life.

[//]
He’s texted me every day since the night we first met, and at first I thought this was annoying. Why doesn’t he assume that he’s bothering me? Is it because I’m always polite enough to respond? But really what should I expect? Sometimes life is as simple as it presents itself to be. People talk to the people they like to talk to. Not everyone is as tightly controlled as I am, not everyone as incredibly inhibited.


This leads to a possible truth: I lived in a fraternity for three years, and although my time there taught me that many of the stereotypes imprecisely attached to fraternities do not universally apply, one certainly and unquestionably did: The house was constantly full of women. Many of these girls were girlfriends of brothers in the house, but many also were not. What I suppose I am trying to say is that if I managed to not have sex while I was in college no less while I lived in a fraternity, then it is likely that I never will.

Once I was able to accept and see women’s rejection of me as something they could not control and something I could not control and which was denying me something I actually did not need, I was released from the illusion that I hated women. 

Once I was able to see that this hunger for intimacy which I felt was denied constantly and coldly by women all the time was really a hunger which wanted something other than companionship, I was released from the idea that I hated women. 


Once I realized the role women wanted me to play in their lives, the same role they implicitly rejected me for failing to play well, was one antithetical to many of the thing I value about myself, I began to free myself from the illusion that I hated women. Moreover once I realized that this way that I apparently desired intimacy from women, was a falsely realized desire I began to see more clearly how different I was from other people. To put it explicitly: I think they really wanted intimacy. I just wanted something to distract me from the emptiness I felt. 



Sometimes I can fall into this state of bumbling and flustered talking/tone/conversation which makes me seem, sometimes intentionally, much less sure of myself than I am. Gbemisola was always calm and serene, and constantly made me field childish in her presence. Maybe that’s what she saw now? Or maybe it was something else.














Baldwin said “Any real change implies the break up of the world as one has always known it, a loss of all that gave one an identity, the end of safety.” 


I find myself on the edge of change in two possible directions and both changes will force me to abandon either side of a contradictory dichotomy by which I viewed myself. Either my loneliness and this clear constant sense that I’m being denied a necessary intimacy is false and inauthentic, and I have to recognize that I do not really want that intimate—defined almost exclusively along sexual lines—connection with another person. Or all the things I have told myself about my distance from people and how fundamentally different I am from them is false, and I can have a relationship with another person.

Hi Victor,

I just wanted to inform you that I received notices from the fellowships I applied to and I didn’t receive them. In any case, thank you for taking the time to write a recommendation for me. 

I also want to thank you again for giving me the opportunity to work for Reasoning Mind last year. I know the work was contracted, and partly transactional, but I am grateful I had the chance to do it; It was incredibly important to me in giving me confidence to do some technical work which came after.  

Also, a random point: I met Sylvester Gates’s daughter recently. She’s a first year student in the Physics Department here. She plans to study pretty abstract stuff. Supersymmetry and string theory. 

I hope the year is going well for you.

Best,
Mobolaji


Hi Ariel,

I just wanted to inform you that I received notices from the fellowships I applied to and I didn’t receive them. In any case, thank you for taking the time to write a recommendation for me. 

I also want to thank you for allowing me to work with you last year. I apologize that I haven’t scheduled a meeting with you so far this semester. Early in the semester I had reached a technical road block in the project, and my time was taken up by coursework and other projects. But I recently completed the last of my departmental requirements, and I should soon be coming to the conclusion of one of my projects, so I will schedule a meeting soon. 

Best,

The End of Safety
It is wrong, what people say about sex not changing you, about a person who is as truly and inevitably the same the day after it happens as he was the day before. I imagine those who say these things are those for whom sex was never a question of “If” but of “When”. Sex was a step on a ladder of development, something seen in the distance and approached inexorably with a solid sense that it would enter one’s life at the appropriate place and appropriate time. And when it did enter such a person’s life—even if it entered against schedule—he or she of course found it did nothing to change their view of themselves, and thus of course their lives too remained undisturbed. (What about humans who were raped?)

But for those few of us who had to make out of this gap in intimacy an identity, in order quite simply to prevent our acceptance of the world’s label of it as a stigma, sex does change us. It forces us to not only relinquish this standard by which we have chosen to see ourselves as special, but also to reinterpret our lives and decisions to this point. Beforehand we were required to see each missed opportunity as not at all squandered but merely sidestepped, as a move fundamental to who we are, a sort of non-choice which only seemed to bear a space for agency because it occurred in real-time with all the other events in our lives (we could more readily control) which moved from ambiguous present to crystallized past. But after what you believed—and accepted, and somehow cherished—would never happen finally does occur, you are forced to confront the questions you have pushed, and intentionally learned how to push, out of our mind, the questions you feared would destroy you and which now, you must admit, hold the answer to knowing who that “you” actually is. 

Because for American men—maybe even for the world’s men—sex acquires, by the point of sexual maturity, an over large significance as a measure of that vague quality termed masculinity. And in so far as the hegemony of masculinity still reigns as completely as it always has in the lives of men, we might as well go all the way and say sex is definitive of what it means to be—whatever this means—a fully realized human being. From such a perspective, virginity then is seen as not only an experiential lack, but an existential one. And if anyone had any doubt concerning the double-edge nature of prejudice, the way it cannot help but to slice both the marginalized and the marginalizers, let sex be an example: The men who use sex as a measure of purity and character in women are the same men who use it as a rubric of human identity in themselves.



 The men who historically have used sex as a standard of purity in women are the same men who have used it as standard of humanity in themselves. 

The men who use sex as a measure of purity and character in women are the same men who use it as a rubric of identity in themselves.



Because for American men, maybe even for the world’s men, sex acquires, by the point of sexual maturity, an undue significance as a measure of that vague quality termed masculinity, And as far as men are concerned, we might as well go all the way and say it is definitive of what it means to be a full human being. 


Because for American men, maybe even for the world’s men, by the time sexual maturity is reached sex acquires an undue significance as a measure of that vague quality termed “masculinity” and as far as the definition of men is concerned we might as well call it definitive of a “human being”

Hi Professor Rycroft,

I am a second year graduate student in the physics department interested in starting research in the direction of computational methods/applied mathematics. I was wondering if you would be free this week or next to discuss opportunities for research in these directions? My schedule is flexible and I can work with mostly any time during the weekday before 4pm.

From Walter Moore’s Schrodiger: Life and Thought

“On November 3, Schrödinger wrote to Einstein: 

A few days ago I read with the greatest interest the ingenious thesis of Louis de Broglie, which I finally got hold of; with it section 8 of your second paper on degeneracy has also become clear to me for the first time. The de Broglie interpretation of the quantum rules seems to me to be related to my note in Zeit. f. Physik 12, 13, 1922, where a remarkable property of the Weyl ‘gauge factor’ along every quasi-period is shown. As far as I can see, the mathematical content is the same, only mine much more formal, less elegant, and not actually shown in general. Naturally de Broglie’s consideration in the framework of his comprehensive theory is altogether of far greater value than my single statement, which I did not know what to make of first.

He was also corresponding with Alfred Landé, professor of physics at Tübingen. On November 16, after discussing derivations of the Planck distribution law, he wrote: 

I was especially pleased with your news that your work would be a ‘return to wave theory’. I am also strongly inclined that way. I have been intensely concerned these days with Louis de Broglie’s ingenious theory. It is extraordinarily exciting, but still has some very grave difficulties. I have tried in vain to make for myself a picture of the phase wave of the electron in the Kepler orbit. Closely neighboring Kepler ellipses are considered as rays. This, however, gives horrible ‘caustics’ or the like for the wave fronts. 

A caustic is a curve that gives the boundaries of an initially plane wave after reflection or refraction. The electron waves of the Broglie theory are traveling waves, and Schrödinger wanted to find the structure of such waves when they are refracted sufficiently to travel in one of the Bohr orbits.”

Simple Example, then Complex Example
Over time I’ve gotten better at doing this one particular thing: Given a complex physical situation or idea, I seem able to reduce it to its barest manifestation which can then be placed in a simpler (computationally/analytically speaking) context. Within this simpler context the idea can then be explored with little mathematical difficulty, and I often find I’m able to gain a better understanding of it. 

But usually this is where I stop. With this new knowledge and new interpretation of some physical situation, I don’t try to apply it to a context more complicated than my engendered example or even as complicated as the problem which motivated the development of the example. I think this is limiting, and would lead my work to be cloistered in this realm of simplicity sans physical relevance. So I will task myself with something: After manifesting a physical idea/technique in a simple example, I should then try to find a more complex example which illustrates it as well. Here are some examples for work I’ve completed before

Phase transitions
Binary alloy -> Spin Glasses

Quenching and Annealing 
Simple Harmonic Oscillators -> Spin Glasses

Renormalization Group
Baby Exponential System -> Scalar Field Theory or Quantum Chromodynamics

Short Manifesto
I’ve been delaying completing the thermal permutations project. It is really dragging on and preventing me from pursuing other work. So is the essay on physics problems. And partly so is the short story I plan to write for queeritas or some other literary magazine. So here comes a manifesto, on this day of Tuesday April 29: Until 
the thermal permutations project is completed to my satisfaction and I have sent queries to various professors (England, Nelson, ??)
until the essay on physics problems is written as a draft and I have sent it to suzanne smith
until I have completed a draft of the story story on sexuality.
I will not
 I will not
listen to a podcast
watch a tv series or a youtube video or a movie
check out Carson McCullers book
These seem like slight restrictions, but they have been the ways I have been allowing myself to procrastinate. The thermal permutations project is already a month past my self imposed deadline. It needs to be completed to some degree.

Baldwin Another Country Quote

He knew that he had no honor which the world could recognize. His life, passions, trials, loves were, at worst, filth, and, at best, disease in the eyes of the world, and crimes in the eyes of his countrymen. There were no standards for him except those he could make for himself. There were no standards for him because he could not accept the definitions, the hideously mechanical jargon of the age. He saw no one around him worth his envy, did not believe in the vast, gray sleep which was called security, did not believe in the cures, panaceas, and slogans which afflicted the world he knew; and this meant that he had to create his standards and make up his definitions as he went along. It was up to him to find out who he was, and it was his necessity to do this, so far as the witchdoctors of the time were concerned, alone.

Hi Professor So and So,

I am a graduate student in Harvard’s physics department, and I’m working on a project in statistical mechanics which could possibly have some relevance to biology. I’m contacting you because I’m looking for advice on what additional questions I should ask and answer to bring the project closer to being publishable as a paper. Attached is a short summary of the project. Would you be available any time this week or next week for a short meeting to discuss the work?

Best,
Mobolaji



Hi Professor Silver and Professor Walsworth,

Is there a time I should come into the lab this week to discuss the last research paper? Or did you already meet with Alex?

Hi Suzanne, 

I spoke with you last week on the third floor of Dudley house about the possibility of getting help  reviewing articles for publication. My apologies for the last name mixup. I have a draft of an article prepared, and I would like help editing it. Is there an hourly rate for your consultation? And on what days and at what times during the week are you available?

Best,
Mobolaji



Rough Motivation for Project


In many biological systems, chains of molecules proteins and constituents in general form the backbone of a biological process. These chains of molecules often must exist in a specific order for the larger macroscopic structure to have its proper function in the biological compound



Chains of molecules are fundamental components of biological cells. For such chains the specific ordering of the constituent components is often fundamental to the resulting function of the final chain such that if deviations (typically termed mutations from an evolutionary perspective) from the correct ordering occur, the final chain can fail to perform its requisite function within the cell, proving fatal to the organism. Diseases such as sickle-cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and Tay-Sachs disease are caused by such mutations in a single gene of a cell. Still, when they are not life-threatening, mutations in the genetic code are necessary for the survival a biological specifics at large because they lead to the genetic diversity which makes biological evolution and adaptation possible. 

Because of the role of sequences of molecules play in such aspects of biology, it is worth asking what general statistical properties might we expect such sequences to have from the perspective of statistical mechanics.

Biological systems are inherently out of equilibrium systems and thus it is generally incorrect to attempt to consider any such system from the perspective of equilibrium statistical mechanics. However as a starting point for analyzing biological systems with clear statistical physics properties, it proves useful to begin considering such systems from the analytically transparent framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics simply in order to lay the groundwork for future, possibly more relevant, non-equilibrium investigations. Especially useful to consider is whether the statistical mapping of such biological systems bear from a theoretical perspective any interesting phenomenological properties which may be found to be useful in a biological context. 

In this work, we investigate this question by positing a theoretical system of thermally distributed permutations and working out some basic physical consequences of the system. We show through a toy model that it’s possible for the system to exhibit phase transitions where the ‘correct’ sequence becomes energetically disfavored, and we also show that the nominally discrete degeneracy spectrum of the model lends itself to a continuum interpretation which allows the system to be studied by solving a partial differential equation for the partition function. We conclude with comments on a non-equilibrium extension of this work, and on the larger relevance of this theoretical question to biological systems and other systems with statistical properties.

Conveying Disapproval
It is through looks, a failure to look, the curtness of answers to reasonable questions that teachers and peers subtly convey the simple assertion “You are not supposed to be here”. To which I say, yes. Fine. But so what? Regardless of what anyone may think about it, no one is supposed to be anywhere let alone on that proverbially sacred ground so often called ‘here’. But people find themselves in places called ‘here’ nevertheless and must engage with the here and the now on the presumption of their current existence in these spaces and not conditioned on the question of their fitness to occupy the place they already do.

Manifesto: Update
You’re probably curious to know how I fared after my declaration of eight days ago. Did I last a day or two days and ultimately succumb to the too-heavy responsibility of my claims? Did I reveal myself once again after so many similar such declarations to be weaker than I believed I could be, weaker than I believed I needed to be? Was I able to do any work at all?

I was. In fact I’ve been working consistently throughout the week, and most extraordinarily, enjoying that work. This claim is not extraordinary in of itself, but it is given my history. A history where for a short time I loved physics and initially worked with it perhaps the way I’m working now, but after which there was a much longer trying period where I was unsure how I felt at all about the subject and hence unsure how I felt about a life built around it. During that time I worked but I so many times did so out of inertia, which is really par for the course when you’re trying to do something new and are consequently lost, but there was little beyond the inertia moving me, there was no compulsion to pull me forward. 

It is foolish to think I have entered a new phase of life after merely  seven days of work, but I am gratified to see that a perspective on work I believed was closed off for me is still open and available for me to adopt. And I am grateful that I have, for this week, been able to adopt it, for I have not listened to a podcast, or watched a Youtube video, or read Carson McCullers’s The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. I have been working and I hope the end-product of the projects I am working on reveal that fact. 

It would be remiss to fail to mention lapses in this direction. When working out on Sunday, I watched 1 minute of Kanye West’s Mercy because I was looking for a music track to listen to and forgot, in the intensity of the workout, about my previous restriction. Also last night, there was a free showing of a new anime film The Boy and The Beast at MIT and I made the deliberate decision to break my visual media fast  in order to watch it. But besides these infractions, I have been rather chaste. 

And this short period of abstention begs a larger question: All the media (the movies, the youtube videos, the porn, the podcasts) I added to my life I did so supposedly because they partially filled (or at least distracted me from) some lack inside me. Actually the podcasts, many times, were quite restorative. But for the movies and the TV shows and the porn and the youtube videos, I so often felt that they were escapes from matters of my life I could not deal with, and so regardless of the artistic presence rendered in each I could only see them with a half glance, obscured as they were by a guilt I could not deny. Nevertheless I was dependent on them, and often even after only days without them, I would always feel the familiar twinge of an itch too long not scratched. Now I will not be so quick to claim that I have finally escaped such dependencies, but surely if these addictions were as strong as I had led myself to believe then I would never have been able to go a week without satisfying them. If they had been acting as placeholders for something real, is the fact that I no longer feel the pressing need to make space for them indicate that the ‘real’ has finally arrived?

I do not know, but what is more certain is that this space exists as it has not existed for a long time. I am wary of acknowledging my state as such, wary of making explicit the fact that I have perhaps been given an opportunity—it feels strange and inaccurate to say that I have created it—to develop a different relationship with time and with the cognitive spaces I occupy every day. I realize—and this realization independent of what is realized carries its own weight—I now must walk carefully because with opportunity comes agency and also the possibility of power, and with power’s possibility, not even it’s full existence, comes responsibility, and this responsibility is one that I have many times decided was simply not worth taking on.

I think it was about a month ago when I was riding the Red line to somewhere, and I looked up to see an advertisement. It said “Are you really glad you binge watched that entire series instead of working on your novel?” The poster was advertising a website (or a course?) where people could work on writing projects and poking fun at a currently universal cultural trend, but I could not help thinking that it was anything but funny. When I read it, I felt what I first felt when I walked by Dunkin Donuts and saw a “Welcome Back” sign leading into the drive way. “So,” I said to myself, “the demons have at last come out and acknowledged their terrible influence over our lives.” Because the influence is indeed terrible. I have spent so much time this year staring at pixelated plastic and absorbing stories and images of courage, risk, and dissolution all the while not daring to live by the principles I claimed to so admire. 

And, no, watching these series is not at all like reading. There is something about a movie or a TV-show which draws one in so much more totally than any book, there is a way it can block out any world outside of the one it creates and make you—or at least make me—inordinately invested in it. 

And of course everyone is doing it. It is so clearly a part of the zeitgeist of our world, it must be indicative of something and must consequently tell us something about ourselves when we take part in it. 

But ultimately the question the poster poses is an appropriate one. How has this dependency prevented you from doing the things you have always wanted to do? I remember an interview between Scott Gimple, executive producer (or writer?) of The Walking Dead, and Aisha Tyler. I listened to it while driving down some now forgotten highway during my road trip with Xintao last year. In the interview Gimple mentioned he knew of a writer who was absolutely excellent and yet who all of a sudden stopped writing new things. When he asked friends what happened to the guy, they said he got completely consumed by playing some video game. 

Now, there are many possible reasons to this. Maybe the guy likes video games more than he likes writing. Or maybe he is depressed—which is another can of worms?barrel of snakes?cave full of hydras?. But the one reason which most frightens me is the one I can so easily identify with: Maybe at one or many moments he had the choice of whether to write or to play the video game, and he simply—due to some momentary weakness—chose the latter. These moments can build on one another so quickly that pretty soon they encapsulate much of your life, and so that the moment, so previously small and innocuous, is revealed to be as dangerous as it in fact had always been. 

I am thus led to ask if the things I have done and felt in the past week are made inaccessible to me because of the media I so constantly inundate myself with, would the cultural connection, the vicarious living through captivating stories, the relative cognitive ease that said media provides be worth the loss? I must conclude it would not be. 

And yet I am wary of placing the issue so starkly because I have so often in the past presented my work in such black and white terms, and the end result was always despair and self-hatred. In truth I have for the longest time recognized on some level where my priorities lie, but I could never ‘live’ this recognition. I always always went back to the media which distracted me from my supposed real work, because this media gave me something my work could not: some relationship to and participation with a world of people and their spectrum of experiences which grandiosely define the human condition. 

Therefore reflecting on it, I am forced to consider this recent change in myself as not totally divorced from something I would usually have believed had nothing to do with it. Indeed, this new level of focus would seem like merely a coincidence were it not in keeping with the shear atypicality of this month

On the first day of this April I received news from the final fellowship I applied to informing me that, like the two others, they were not giving me any money; I most likely would have to spend the next three (or more) years teaching. That night I went to Tony’s house and was confronted with a version of myself I, at the time, believed was new, but which I am now led to admit had merely been long suppressed. A week later I went out with Dat and I did so again a week after. With Tony I watched Batman vs. Superman. With Dat I watched Cloverfield 10 Road and a series of short films categorized under the title Sex works. In fact it was while I was walking through MIT with Dat that I saw the poster for The Boy and the Beast. 

‘What is happening to me?’ I ask myself, for these experiences seem totally foreign to the desires of any version of myself I recognize.  I think I am changing, becoming less afraid of the things I feel, becoming more willing to acknowledge that I feel them. And the feeling I am acknowledging is not sexual desire; rather it is a desire to experience that desire with	 people in my physical world. I had always believed this desire did not exist for me because it always seemed that there was no space for it to exist. All of my loves rejected me, so I say, and therefore I had to learn to envision a life where such relationships were not fundamental. With such envisioning, life soon relaxes into something more extreme and I found myself largely closed off from both non-platonic as well as platonic interactions. Quite simply it had become difficult to, as they say, ’relate to people’, to share something honest about yourself as someone else does the same. Phrased differently, it had become too easy, too habitual as to become reflexive, to hide myself from other people. And through it all, I failed to realize—and you have to excuse me for how maudlin this sounds—I was also hiding myself from myself. 

Perhaps it was this failure for self-regard which necessitated the escape that films and tv shows provided. In these stories, specifically the stories I most enjoyed like The Walking Dead and The Leftovers, I could somehow intuit that they were engaging with existential matters I had failed to resolve in my own life. And of course they presented the two dimensional representation of real three dimensional human beings, who unlike the human beings I saw everyday, I could pretend to understand. These tv shows gave me a space to experience in some way a drama I could not live. 

But with my dates with Dat and Tony, I seem to have moved closer to living it, and having somewhat moved away from a life experienced exclusively through digital media, I have developed the space for other things—such as work—to occupy the relative vacuum.

Letter to Joke
Hello Joke!

I am finally sending the chocolate covered almonds to you. Hilariously enough, I bought a pack of such almonds about a month ago, but then I told myself that since you don’t go to the dentist, I shouldn’t be adding any extra sugar to your diet. So I ate them! Alas, I eventually realized I was just giving myself a convenient reason—although a valid one; go to the dentist!—to justify my gluttony. So I bought you another pack.

I hope you’re doing well, and I hope your business idea is getting off the ground. I really admire the fact that you are being an active liberal, trying to correct the social inequities you see around you rather than just complaining about them.

Included in this package is a copy of the Dudley Review which contains the story I submitted and which you previously read a version of. Yesterday, during the launch party for the review, I gave a reading on a section of the story. I was so nervous. I jumbled my words so many times. But in the end people told me they liked the story, so I suppose all is well. 

Finally, let me tell you about the project that I’ve been trying to get off the ground. It concerns trying to find an abstract statistical physics model for the sequences of molecules and compounds which form biological chains. The idea is that the sequences of constituents in macromolecules (like proteins) largely determine the stability of those macromolecules, such that if a different sequence was adopted the compound would no longer be energetically (or maybe even evolutionarily) stable. Abstractly, this is best understood through a schematic picture

(Picture)

In the picture we consider a space of sequences of four elements. The horizontal axis associates a position on the axis with a particular sequence, and the curve shows how the potential of the sequence varies according to the sequence label and, thus, the ordering of the elements. The correct sequence (the $\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4$) sequence is at a local minimum of the potential. 

(To be honest this wasn’t really my motivation in solving the problem. I was originally working on the statistical physics problem somewhat abstractly, and in order to justify the work for a wider audience I needed to find some larger context for it and this is what I came up with.)

My question is what are the equilibrium statistical properties of sequences encoded in such a picture. I represented these ideas abstractly and calculated the partition function for such a model, and I found something pretty interesting: The partition function (which was concerned with a discrete system) could be related to a partial differential equation for some unknown continuous system.

(Equation)

I am still trying to workout the implications of all this, but I think it’s pretty interesting as it is. I’ve been working for the past two weeks—foregoing TV series, youtube videos, and podcasts— to write up the results I have so far. It’s been great living so ascetically and focusing on work and I would never have thought it were possible during the ver long period when I disliked physics.

 I’m starting to think what I so disliked about physics was the perspective the physics program at MIT was implicitly encouraging me to have concerning it. I wanted to be a good student so I had to at least in some way engage with that perspective but it was difficult to do so because it was so divorced from my original motivation which made any work possible. Of course, as you have told me, the issue is rarely so black-and-white so I’m currently trying to find ways to balance my own view of physics with the view of a physics community.

I’ve also (finally!) finished a draft of the essay I asked you to read last year. (It was the essay on physics problems) Yesterday I sent it to the graduate school writing tutor for advice on editing. I’m working on so many projects because they have been on the back burner for far too long and I am trying to get a sense of what my working life might look like if I work on all the things I’m interested in. It’s been difficult trying to balance it all, but very gratifying when I finish a piece of work. 

I will stop now because I’m starting to sound like mom: announcing, unprompted, the news of my life. 

Enjoy the Almonds!

May 5, 2016—Thursday 6:28 PM
Postscript

About two weeks ago I made a declaration that I could not have honestly believed I would keep. It was made emotionally, out of some combination of clarity and frustration. What was simultaneously apparent and enraging was that there was work that I wanted to do and I was not doing it. I was making the small incremental progress that I have learned to appreciate—because how else could you live a life where that was really the only progress you seemed able to make?—but this progress did not seem at all sufficient to bring me to where I wanted to be. 

Where did I want to be? Firstly, I wanted to finish that damn thermal permutations project that I had been working on all semester. Secondly, I wanted to finish the essay on physics problems I started and abandoned last year. Thirdly, I wanted to finish the story on sexuality I planned to send to Queeritas. I was being pulled in other directions, towards supposedly more interesting work, but I knew that in some sense, both philosophical and practical, that if I never finished the work on thermal permutations and the essays, then I would never finish anything else. 

And there was so much more I wanted to finish. I have had vague ideas for projects for years. They varied from concrete physics projects to softer ideas on the structure of education and the problems one could solve in such an education. But about a month ago, I decided to be more concrete about these ideas. I made a list of about ten categories and listed three or four projects under each category. It was illuminating to see all my plans organized in this way, but it was also intimidating, for by writing all of this down I was in some way admitting to myself the reality of my ideas and the potential that these ideas could have some reality to other people. This admission in turn implied a responsibility to myself and my own thoughts, and although I have been quite adept at paying lip service to this responsibility, I have seldom, when the time came, been able to live up to its demands. 

Because, you see, I am a man who cannot make up his mind. There are many things I want to do and these things in some way conflict with who I have always thought I should be. At the point of such a conflict a choice must be made and the choice rendered abstractly in one’s mind always fails to bear out completely the nature of the consequences one will meet when that choice is lived. I like to write. I like working through the logical and deductive framing of physical reality. I also like the feeling of being a good soldier, of fulfilling the goals people set for me, of succeeding within the institutions which give and deny value, of establishing an identity through subscription to ideals many might claim are universal but which few could convincingly argue are personally derived. 

For the writing and the physics, most people cannot do both, they say. There are the technocrats, idly working away at the technical minutiae which fails to “truly connect with the existential matters of a life” and then there are the writers who cannot help but connect to those matters through their language. It’s the “math people” and the “humanists”. The “left brain” and the “right brain”. The socially awkward and the socially conscious. Both misfits, in a way. Both you would expect to not have been invited to many parties in their youth, but who each responded to that loneliness in ways individual and immiscible. 

There is something about America, Americans, and the macroscopic and individual histories of each which makes the simple narratives of black and white dichotomies not merely an attractive but an almost necessary way of framing a life. In spite of the name, this framing has nothing, superficially—and perhaps everything, deeply—to do with the history of racism in this country. (It has more to do with the definition of identity and the need to establish identity if not necessarily according to what one is, most certainly according to what one is not.) And while I have many times been on the receiving end of being limited by such a perspective on life, I, like most people (although this is no justification) cannot help adopting it when it is convenient. 

But I have been realizing as it pertains to the work I want to do, it is most inconvenient to believe and act on the notions our country has concerning the artistic and intellectual attributes, always inborn and so bestowed as to be above moral condemnation, intrinsic to a person. 

Words and symbolic logic. The writing and the mathematics. To be candid, I don’t know if one can do both—for example, there is an essay by a mathematician and writer who claims that no one, historically, has been successful in both areas which, to me, suggests the question of how one would define “success”—but I do know that for me the query is somewhat irrelevant because for the longest time I have been doing just that. 

And I have felt that it is not that people cannot engage in both ways of living, but that (given all the people who do) most people choose not to. But I need to do both or, more honestly, I don’t really know what I need and I simply want—out of a lack a focus or a simple inability to sequester the parts of myself I have always felt were connected—to do both. 

And then there is the question of obedience, a question which cannot be ignored when one is part of the hierarchical systems that bestow status and what substitutes for a selfhood to so many people. This question is typically answered by finding the people who will tell you what to do and executing in ways which indicate you could be useful to them and hence useful to the larger systems to which they had long ago declared their fidelity.  It is a pyramid scheme of identity development: You make a deal to convince authority figures of your worth to them now, all the while deferring for months and years to cultivate in yourself anything personally affecting, and they, who are themselves making the same deal, implicitly promise to keep you on the path which leads ultimately to all the external trappings of a life well lived. 

I had believed in the necessity of this obedience for so long that even when I realized it often destroyed more than it created, I still habitually fell into the pattern of living within the boundaries it set. I still wanted to be a good student, I still felt compelled to ask “how high?” no matter many times such dutifulness failed to provide me with what I thought it would.

And months ago I realized this scrupulousness again seemed to be standing in the way of something possibly better, of successfully engaging with that supposedly dichotomous mode of thinking (the physics, the writing) I had long ago realized was so necessary to living. I had work I needed to complete for Amir, work I had put off for so long both because I was stuck and because I had found the work difficult to care about. It was strange to be unable to compel myself to just do the work I thought I needed to. But then again, maybe it wasn’t so strange because I had indeed been here before. I had been here with Jesse, and surely with the many school assignments I managed to pull through and finish hours or minutes before the deadline. 

My previous success in this sense suggested for my work with Amir that, of course, there was something wrong with me. Not to mention the rest of my peers seemed—because one’s contemporaries could seldom fail to “seem” this way—to be successfully and adroitly completing the work they were assigned and to see nothing at all wrong with the apprenticeship model of graduate education in science, a model which demanded that students work enthusiastically on other people’s projects and believe (and propagate) the lie that they are in some way escaping the emptiness and disaffection of a real job. 

But yet there was much evidence for the idea that the problem lay within me and not somewhere else. I simply lacked the requisite discipline and focus to complete the work as it should have been completed. And this was infuriating because I was finding that it meant that I was no longer a good student and could thus no longer use such a label as the crutch for identity it had always been. And, more concretely, that I also would be cut off from all the apparent perks (the recommendations, the papers, the external validation) typically supplied to the student who meets all the expectations of his professor.

The problem: I was, honestly, a serial procrastinator. Having long ago realized that engaging with the sexier and more communal forms of modern social media always left me feeling lonelier and more deeply self loathing than before, my preferred mode of escape was visual media. I watched hours and hours of TV series (The Walking Dead, The Leftovers, The Badlands, From the New World, No. 6, Erased, Parasyte, Sense8) and hours and hours of movies (The Way He Looks, Night Flight, Equilibrium, Slow Learners, The Big Short) and listened to hours and hours of podcasts (This American Life, Snap Judgment, Longform, Girl on Guy, Think Again, Fresh Air, The Memory Palace, Radiolab, TED Radio Hour). And although I was explicitly trying to escape work through the stories experienced vicariously through earphones and pixelated plastic, I was also trying to escape the subtle recognition that my need to complete the work Amir assigned, if ultimately fulfilled, would lead me ever closer to denying the parts of myself the world, through its own prior denial of these parts, had forced me to uniquely value.

It seemed as though my mind was saying “If watching ten straight hours of The Seven Deadly Sins will prevent you from building a life you do not want, then just watch the damn ten hours. In fact watch twenty!” The argument seemed specious because I could not always tell where the lines were drawn. How did I know what things built towards a life I wanted? How would I know what such a life even looked like?

But Amir’s work was my focus, and although I imagined scenarios where I could cultivate in myself some modicum of interest in his assigned project, I think I also knew that as long as completing the project was the target, I had prematurely doomed myself to failure, having, in a way, chosen the failure at the outset when I made the choice to faithfully work on something I did not believe in. And to be clear, I knew this because “Working on something I did not believe in” was really the brunt of my collaborative work in physics. Jesse (who I in some way recognize is really an adroit and productive physicist) as my advisor during my time at MIT, assigned me many problems all of which were grounded in finding some way to solve current physics problems through models of supersymmetry. Supersymmetry, as a mathematical construct derived from a physical problem, is indeed quite beautifully rendered, but I have never believed it could really model the physical world. This belief, of course, is naked hubris. Why? for one, so much of the high energy physics community has the opposite belief (admittedly, with the LHC results as they are, less so now); for two, a man really does not know what secrets nature holds. For this latter reason, it is thus horribly myopic to convince yourself of an impossibility of principles simply because they conflict with how you think the world should work. 

But I could not help succumbing to my human weaknesses, in multiple, conflicting directions as it turned out because although I did not believe in supersymmetry it seemed that I believed even less in not doing the work set in front of me. It was my senior year and the larger goal was to use Jesse’s recent ideas on multiple supersymmetry breaking to devise a model for decaying dark matter particles for comparison with the then recent Fermi lab telescope data. Now, how sexy does that sound? How titilating? Imagine saying that a party and then imagine the eyes of your conversation partner growing wide in astonishment, fear, and new respect. Such was my experience and such was the basis for which I convinced myself that the project was worthwhile. And still the self denial could only go so far, as I found myself on so many days when I should have been working, sitting in the comfortable red chairs on the second floor of Hayden reading comic books. Spiderman (Don’t ask which artist; I can’t remember) was my preferred distraction choice, and I think I got through a few books of his story. It was just that I had so much free time from the work. Or at least the time was not actually “free”—and honestly when is it ever? when is time ever not inordinately and terrifyingly expensive?—but stolen, as I found when the thesis submission deadline was nearing, and calculating my rate of work and the days left to complete the thesis, I realized I would not finish in time. I had to take a month extension. I really felt like I needed a month and a half, but I was told I would not be able to have the thesis as part of my undergraduate record unless I finished it before graduation day. So I buckled down and did it, successfully procuring the discipline needed to pull through and get out a finished product. 

But looking back on it, it is not a product in which I can admit to having much pride. The material is abstract and technical, arguably the most abstract and technical thing I had done to that point, and I know that is often the yard stick by which some physicists judge the depth and importance of their work, but for me that work has always left me cold. The only thing I think is interesting about the project is the degenerate perturbation theory solution to the mass spectrum of fermions in the toy model of multiple supersymmetry breaking. Mostly I try not to think about it, and there were times when I fantasized about removing it from the internet. The dissertation is too riddled with mistakes from a mind who did not care enough about it (who did not have enough personally invested within it) to be scrupulous in detailed editing. Jargon is used to hide a lack of understanding. Problems are introduced and incompletely solved. The project is entirely ill motivated. 

So yes I know what it is like to come—through focus, discipline, and the dint of a vigilant self-abnegation—to the end of a project, and to feel, not accomplishment, but exhaustion and disgust. But I really tried to hide from myself this former knowledge and to believe with Amir it would all somehow be different. 

It would be completely amiss not to mention that the work I did for Jesse is really what got me here to Harvard, enjoying all the resources and freedom I currently do. One could legitimately ask (as I many times have done and still do) if being here is in fact a good thing, but, assuming it is, my experiences seem to exemplify the fact that the world is really not as simple as black and white caricatures present it to be. One can stay faithful to principles of one’s choosing and can fail to get the riches one supposedly deserves, and one can compromise again and again and seem to be incapable of not receiving gifts.

It would also be amiss not to mention that I simply was not ready to work for myself at that point. As a good student, I had attentively imbibed the principles of work implicit in the structure of my education, and by the time that I realized that such habits were in fact antithetical to the habits needed to do creative and personally developed work, it was already too late to build new habits in time for graduation. But I started building them anyway, recognizing in some sense that they were useful beyond my current status as a student. Thus I became strangely interested in education for my own utilitarian purposes. I started asking why I was educated in the way I was and how I perhaps should be educated in order to do the work I wanted to do. 

And those questions and the answers I built with great difficulty year after year were, I suppose, what led me to an explicit conflict with Amir’s work. At the start of January things with Amir were at a standstill and I had some projects in my backlog that I was putting off in order to work on the Kovacs project. By this time I had grown to despise the Kovacs project and felt trapped by the conditions by which Amir had defined it. I had found some nice analytic and computational representations of the main problem, but the full solution seemed to require a tedious trial and error search of a five dimensional space of parameters. 

Not to mention Amir told me he had too many students and that I should be looking for a new advisor. (“Maybe Rycroft? Maybe Brenner?”) I still wanted to complete the work and hopefully turn it into a paper, in order to some how justify to myself that it was all worthwhile, but when I asked Amir about writing drafts he told me we were still a very long way from having anything to write about. Which of course, rather than humbling me, annoyed me deeply and I found myself realizing that I had not much more to give to complete the work. I of course did not tell Amir this. I couldn’t even articulate it to myself for fear of what it might mean. 

Fortunately, with the other projects I had been until that time neglecting, it seemed I had options. Also it seemed that Amir was unintentionally tutoring me in a lesson that I had been previously taught and should have internalized long ago. I was, in a way, demanding him to assist me in the achievement of my identity, and he was, in a way, telling me that he could not do so. 

So I started work on the thermal permutations project. And I also started work, again, on the essay on physics problems. And I joined Surge, again, and started acting upon the sexual identity I had always knew was there. I was changing, and even now that half the year has seemingly blazed by in an instant, I realize I have changed, that although the change was meted out in invisible increments each day, it’s collective magnitude cannot be denied. 

But the work was difficult, not specifically in its technical details (although, of course, there was that), but in my attempts to manage it all while still consuming all the visual media which had previously kept me afloat. But the question concerning that media was no longer the same. Instead of being “Seven Deadly Sins or a project you don’t want to work on?” the choice became “Seven Deadly Sins or a project that you could not stop thinking about for months?” The answer, supposedly so easy to know in a theoretical space, was difficult to live. 

In essence, it seemed that the habits I had cultivated to escape the work I had not wanted to do were preventing me from doing the work that I did. I was still procrastinating, taking unjustified breaks and watching significant (but admittedly less) television in the interim between periods of work. And I was finding it, despondently, more and more difficult each day to move the proverbial boulder up the hill. 

And then on April 1st I received my last rejection from the fellowships I applied to and the anger rose up in me savagely and completely. I had tried to acquire the luminous positions of status and achievement currently existent in the world of young scientists in training, positions I had previously occupied so ostentatiously and proudly, and I had failed. Of course, the representation of myself I sold to the fellowship committees was personally false, based as it were on my project with Amir and on an attempt to present myself as I believed I should be seen. And the argument which thrust itself upon me was the same argument that floored me when I was trying and failing to convince women to be interested in me: If I am failing when I am faithful to that thing called personal integrity, and failing as well when I violate that integrity, what really is the value in being anything other than yourself?

Which, of course, is the wrong way to look at it. You should, people say, have personal integrity regardless of the temporary benefits any denial of that integrity provides. A commendable and heroic framing of a life, for sure, but it was one that I could never trust as true, for it seemed to exist in stark contradiction to man’s need for community and acceptance.  

So, significantly, I think it was the email from the NDSEG which set me over the edge. I didn’t write about it because I had other things (like Tony and like Dat) on my mind at that point, but that rejection had certainly lay the seed for what came weeks later when I realized April was half over, and the projects which should have been completed by the start of March still remained undone. Hence the improbable declaration, and hence the period of work which I concluded on Wednesday. 

The summary? I completed a working draft of the thermal permutations project (a task which was far more difficult than I initially imagined) and I completed a draft of “The Missing Curriculum in Problem Solving Education” essay. I did not complete the short story for Queeritas because I did not have time to do so. All the while I did not watch any youtube videos, or any TV series, or listen to any podcasts. This week on Tuesday, a day before I submitted the essay draft I did watch porn at the end of the night which although not listed in my restrictions certainly violates the spirit of the list. But largely, I removed from my cognitive diet all the the standard and consuming ways I used to distract myself from work. And unsurprisingly, after this removal it became more possible to do the substantial work I felt these projects necessitated. There were (and are) still some kinks to work out concerning project organization and the viability of juggling multiple projects across multiple academic domains and I expected this to take a week rather than two weeks and a half, but I don’t think I could honestly call this experience anything other than successful. 

I am wondering what foundational skills I needed to make all of this possible. Would it be accurate to say that the patterns of discipline (no matter how meager) I cultivated by dutifully completing, for years, work I did not enjoy made it possible to complete the work I now do enjoy? Or is it that this discipline stood in the way of engaging with personally valuable work because such discipline could never be divorced from its motivations, and, as one finds throughout life, the thing that one is pretending to be cannot help but evolve into the thing that one always thought one was?

Or perhaps the discipline existed in me before and I am now only rediscovering it. The times I remember working this hard and enjoying that work were the spring break of my freshman year at MIT, the summer months in MITES in 2008, the days of that year in high school I spent learning physics, and spring break of my sophomore year when I learned trigonometry. At these times I remember having a somewhat exaggerated focus on work, a focus which seemed to make all other activities languid and limp in comparison. It felt good then as it surely does now to be so intent and so productive. It is a kind of power, and like most men who get a taste of power after feeling powerless for so long I am trying my best to hold on to it. I at last am seeing what it will take to bring into reality the goals I have for the longest time been dreaming about. It will require me to be a largely different person from whom I have been. I will need to become someone whose priorities exist not merely as the ideals, conveniently not lived as to not face the danger of a world which resists them, but which are instead reflected in his actions and the products of those actions. I do not think I can aspire to frame the issue better than Baldwin: I want to be an honest man, and a good writer and a good physicist. 



Loose Ends
——-
These were the questions I was dealing with two weeks ago. I had by that point long abandoned Amir’s project, and I found myself working more dedicatedly—and strangely, beautifully enjoying that work—on  my own projects but I was finding myself again at a roadblock. It seemed that the habits I had cultivated to escape the work I had not wanted to do were preventing me from doing the work that I did. In short, I was still procrastinating, taking unjustified breaks and watching significant (but admittedly less) television in the interim between periods of work. And I was finding, despondently, it more and more difficult each day to move the proverbial boulder up the hill. 


They themselves are making the same deal, and they are so adept at convincing you of the deal’s rightness because they have to believe in it themselves.

May 6, 2016 — Saturday 11:47 AM
Thoughts of Women
Something strange has been happening ever since that night with Tony and that other night with Dat. It’s like something has been unlocked in me, a door has been opened. In the fiction I’ve read, whenever this happens it only happens in one way. A man, who was afraid of intimacy with men, discovers love and thereafter spends a night or a summer or a year basking in that love. Ultimately, this love is short lived and the two lovers eventually have to separate, but afterwards the man who was initially afraid is forever changed. You’ll find him at bars and gyms and back alleys pursuing that initial feeling he so previously resisted, trying to find the man who can at least physically simulate what he had so feared and what had so inspired his change. 

So the story goes. But for me what I find myself desiring is not other men, but women. It is as though I can finally “see” them, for it seems that when I was looking at any new woman in the past, I could not help but see how she was a representation and a potential addition to my previous experiences of humiliation and anger with other women. Like the classical narcissist, I looked out at the world and only saw myself. I think it was because of the insecurities I could not disabuse. As one must do with faults which do not disappear I made these insecurities into a virtue, and, instead of claiming that they kept me back from things I wanted, I held onto them because I believed that they made me clearly who I was and who I was meant to be. 

It would not merely have been an act of will or re-solidification of character to overcome such a narrative of myself or of my relationship to women. I certainly had tried to do so years ago when I had discovered how consuming my hatred of them had become. After that period of reflection, although I had learned to soften the immediate anger I felt towards women, they still largely represented a boundary beyond which my identity seemed incapable of moving.

When I was a boy, I never—and perhaps this is evidence enough for what came later—went through the standard phase of hating girls. I always liked them implicitly and illogically, and my youthful fantasies always centered around relationships—prematurely non-platonic given my age then—with them. But as I moved from boyhood to adolescence and to young adulthood I was discovering that they did not regard me in the same way. I had failed hopelessly to live up to the standard tropes which made boys attractive to girls at that age and as a testament to my failure, my female peers did little to hide their disapproval. I think my response to this rejection was typical: It would not at all be inaccurate to claim that my turning inward, into a world of physics and mathematics, was a byproduct of repeated failures to establish contact with women.

Of course, as a good scientist should do, I looked for generalities. Perhaps, the misogyny which was large and ever growing was just a small piece of the misanthropy I chose not to see. Maybe the problem wasn’t women; it was all people. I recognized of course that I liked men (not merely sexually, but romantically as well), but somehow I had never even considered what a lived intimacy with one could be like. And what was ever present from walking around the world and occupying it, was that I did not like, implicitly or even when I knew a little about them, people. So it was easy to see the patterns in my distance with women as being representative of a larger ailment, and this new vision in some way softened the blow of all those previous rejections. 

Or so I told myself. During my spring semester at Harvard I found myself doing something I never imagined I would do: Pants around my ankles, video chatting with a guy across the country. It was almost certainly on a Friday, days after pushing myself beyond endurance to complete the requisite portion of the Reasoning Mind project, my electromagnetism assignments, the teaching lab lecture, the AM207 assignment, and my Yoruba work. I had experienced a mental breakdown which was not out of the ordinary because by then I was having them weekly. I would crash on a Friday night and spend the subsequent weekend in my room trying to wash my mind of any residual cognition through hours of binge eating, porn, TV series, and movies. I was, however, never completely successful as by Monday or Tuesday, I would regain my senses and get back to the work as it needed to be done. 

But this particular night the crash seemed different. And of course it was. I was lonely and trying to understand my loneliness. I think it came at a time when another girl had made it clear that she wasn’t interested in me. Not to mention I was largely disconnected from my peers who seemed intent on living in the masturbatory bubble of the physics department. So I went online. Those tentative steps with a webcam became larger and more despairing over the next months. I turned to craigslist, and texting guys I met there and trying again and again to answer a call that I was feeling faintly. During the summer, I read (part of) Giovanni’s room, which made me acknowledge at last that the thing I should be fighting was not these feelings but the idea that these feelings should be fought. Then came the fall semester and it was more of the same: talking and texting but no acting until, that is, I read more of Baldwin’s work. I remember telling my sister years ago, having read only “Sonny’s Blues”, “Notes from a Native Son”, and an essay which described (but is not called) ‘the price of the ticket’, that Baldwin was the only writer all of whose writings I liked. Then I read “The Fire Next Time” and realized that this previous statement was more true than I initially imagined. 

And it shames me to write this, shames me perhaps more than anything else I’ve written, but I will do so anyway: It was not until I read Baldwin deeply and continuously that I fully disabused myself of the idea that black people were intellectually inferior to white people. My entire family—my mother, my father, my sister, and even me—should have been evidence enough in this direction, but so insidious and entrenched are the narratives one’s culture forces upon one that it often takes repeated exposure of the falseness of those narratives for them to be fully exorcized. 

Baldwin’s writings were the most evocative thing I had read from any writer—black, white, brown, yellow, or purple—in a long time, and I knew from my own experience in both domains that the skills necessary to be a good writer were very much related to the skills needed to be a good physicist . And thus that technical domain, in which so many have argued that black people are naturally deficient, proved not to be the potential representation of my inhumanity that some tacitly made it out to be. And the way I felt and the way so many of my peers in the physics department treated me was brought into greater clarity as being truly reflective not of anything about me but because of the prejudices neither of us could completely relinquish. 

Do not get me wrong; these are things I had always known in that weird non-actional intellectual space where it is possible to know anything. But it was not until Baldwin that I had seen this knowledge externally represented in another person, it was not until I read his work that I believed these things were true independent of my unquestionable existential need to believe in them. He gave me the permission to like myself without conditions and have this self-appreciation be implicit and not held hostage to anything I would or would not be able to accomplish in the world. He showed me that I no longer had to prove anything to anyone, that I could simply live a life, because he had already proved whatever needed to be proved.

And so I started acknowledging the parts of myself that I had previously so denied. It was around this time that I first signed up for Surge and also around this time when I told my sister and my roommates that I liked guys. Terrifying steps, each of them, but steps which have revealed themselves to be absolutely necessary.  Ultimately I went on my first mutually acknowledged date with a guy, and then in another moment of frustration with Surge I downloaded a different app, Jack’d, and eventually started talking to Tony and Dat. 

It is wrong, what people say about sex not changing you, about a person who is as truly and inevitably the same the day after it happens as he was the day before. I imagine those who say these things are those for whom sex was never a question of “If” but of “When”. Sex was a step on a ladder of development, something seen in the distance and approached inexorably with a solid sense that it would enter one’s life at the appropriate place and appropriate time. And when it did enter such a person’s life, he or she of course found it did nothing to change their view of themselves, and thus of course their lives too remained undisturbed.

But for those few of us who had to make out of this gap in intimacy an identity, in order quite simply to prevent our acceptance of the world’s label of it as a stigma, sex does change us. It forces us to not only relinquish this standard by which we have chosen to see ourselves as special, but also to reinterpret our lives and decisions to this point. Beforehand we were required to see each missed opportunity as not at all squandered but merely sidestepped, as a move fundamental to who we are, a sort of non-choice which only seemed to bear a space for agency because it occurred in real-time with all the other events in our lives which moved from ambiguous present to crystallized past. But after what you believed—and accepted, and somehow cherished—would never happen finally does occur, you are forced to confront the questions you have pushed, and intentionally learned how to push, out of our mind, the questions you feared would destroy you and which now, you must admit, hold the answer to knowing who that “you” actually is. 

Because for American men—maybe even for the world’s men—sex acquires, by the point of sexual maturity, an over large significance as a measure of that vague quality termed masculinity. And in so far as the hegemony of masculinity still reigns as completely as it always has in the lives of men, we might as well go all the way and say sex is definitive of what it means for men to be—whatever this means—a fully realized human being. From such a perspective, virginity, then, is seen as not only an experiential lack, but an existential one. And if anyone had any doubt concerning the double-edge nature of prejudice, the way it cannot help but to slice both the marginalized and the marginalizers, let sex be an example: The men who use sex as a measure of purity and character in women are the same men who use it as a rubric of human identity in themselves.

I suppose, I was no exception. I saw myself through the same, hopelessly myopic lens that our culture seemingly demanded men use to see themselves, and consequently I always deemed myself suspect. Perhaps this is what made me pursue physical contact as fervently as I did, trying to find some way, any way, to prove that the implications of my inadequacy were not true. I knew as well that I had a time limit, that being out of college and getting older, made each year a more difficult one for me to add this particular element to my set of experiences. I was terrified and I tried my best to not know this terror because I had the intuition to recognize that it could easily swallow me and bring me back to the darkness I escaped a year and a half a go. 

So, yes, I recognize Tony in a way set me free. I recently read an essay by Wesley Yang about the Virginia Tech Massacre by Seung-Hui-Cho. The essay is quite irreverent to the standard narrative the country currently adopts for the reasons such things occur. There is little talk of gun legislation or the “alarming lack” of mental health resources for students. Rather he tells the story of a weird kid who apparently deeply wanted intimacy and was constantly denied it. He repeatedly contextualizes his description—to protect himself from accusations of misogyny maybe?—by saying that Cho was very disturbed and that it makes sense that people avoided him, but, nevertheless, by the end of the essay one cannot help walking away feeling some how implicated, feeling that you are in some way a party to the terrible thing Cho did. This, I think, is how it should be. We should never delude ourselves into believing that our passive complicity to the mores of our culture make us free from blame, simply because we ourselves did not act, when those mores yielded consequences. 

Cho wanted revenge and an acknowledgment in death of what he felt he was denied in life. So he sought to take from others literally, what he, perhaps, felt they metaphorically took from him; not merely a life, but a sense that said life is not fatally tied to forces, impulses, and ignorances lying outside one’s control.

From Wang’s description of him, I see much of myself in Cho, as I saw much of myself in Rogers. I too felt frustrated and impotent, and as a result had also developed a deep and entrapping hatred of the world which compelled me to destroy something. But Cho murdered many many people, and thus his desire for destruction was inflicted upon the world through acts which surely could never provide the necessary catharsis to his estrangement. But my desire for destruction was always directed inwards, and the only person I wanted to murder was myself.


But with my experiences of this month, much of this interstitial anger has melted away. And with the haze of anger clearing, I can, for once, see women outside of the perspective which viewed them primarily as representations of my difference, for, at last, I realize that I am not different. 

With this new sight comes new dreams and new fantasies. The newness is particularly relevant because there was something quite amiss about all my previous fantasies. There were so many of them and I had had them for so long that it seems next to impossible that, having only lived with new ones for a much shorter time, I am now slowly losing my grip on what the old ones were. The issue: I always imagined myself in bed with another person, doing to them things I had seen done to other people, and I imagined enjoying these things, but words have their limits as conveyors of experience, and after having experienced the real thing I recognize there is something completely different about touching someone and dreaming of touching someone. The physical immediacy of the moment and the tension and subtle fear it induces in you all feel impossible to explain or to communicate. This is perhaps a copout, claiming that simply because I do not know how to do an experience justice through words then no one can, so I will be precise and claim that the limitation exists primarily in me. 

And then there are the fantasies of women. Fantasies I had in the past but which I never completely allowed myself to entertain. The block, previously so strong and so evident, is now no longer there. I imagine women in my room (my new room here at 9 Parkdale), with most of their clothes removed and my hand on their thigh and on their abdomen, their chest, their neck. I kiss them and they lay on their back in bed and each of my palms is on either side of them while my arms extend above them like the pillars of a canopy.  I take off what little clothes they have left, and I lay next to them and pull them towards me and we kiss again. The fantasy has a color it did not have before and I find myself, instead of looking on with a detached mulling objectivity, being pulled towards the fantasy’s realization. And what I feel, unquestionably, and hugely, is desire. A desire imprecise and overwhelming in its outlines. It has been so long since I felt something like this, such a general and undirected hunger, one not at all connected to a specific person but to a group of people. It is not clear to me how to manage these new feelings. Or maybe they do not need to be managed. Maybe my entire problem is that for much of my life  I have been trying so desperately to regulate things which should have been left as they are, trying to mitigate the intensity of experiences for which safety only existed after one had moved completely through them. 

So currently I have given myself a project. I want to see these fantasies meted out in reality. I want to see whether the reality matches the intensity of the picture. The fact that I am making this admission is perhaps indication enough of the new sense of hope I’ve found. But hope, of course, is rarely enough to achieve anything. One needs as well some active impulse at the source, something which is willing to step forward and act even without hope’s confirmation. It remains to be seen how well I can do this.

The Path to Thermal Permutations

It was my last semester at Franklin when I started reading Schweber’s QED and the Men Who Made It. I remember thinking the book was quite fantastic. I had never read a book like it, one which discussed the history of physics without secreting away any important physics or mathematics. The biographies were also great reads. Learning about the early lives of Feynman, Schwinger, Dyson, and Tomonaga made me feel less alone as I tried to build my own life in physics. 

I had just started learning quantum field theory at the time. My goal, I think, was to really understand why Feynman was so famous and so revered in physics. “What did he actually do?” I asked myself. The question began when I read Surely You’re Joking Mr. Feynman a year before, and it wasn’t answered when I read Gleick’s hagiography, so I had turned to Schweber’s book. But strangely, what captivated me in Schweber’s book was Dyson’s story, the story of a young mathematician who becomes a mathematical physicist largely after reading just a few texts. It is a story which largely contradicted my admonishments to my former students, namely that physics is not mathematics and simply because one excels in the latter does not directly imply that one would excel in the former. 

In Schweber’s book there was an equation that Dyson derived as his first project from Hans Bethe. The goal of the project was to compute the Lamb Shift based on the assumption that the electron was a spin zero particle rather than a spin 1/2 one. I think there was a great deal of luck in the fact that Dyson was assigned this particular problem as his first project given that he had previously read (and worked through) Heitler’s book on the quantum theory of radiation. I recall being really intrigued by this equation that Dyson derived. It looked so complicated, and yet someone with just a few years experience in physics—although a rather sophisticated knowledge of mathematics—was able to derive it. I wanted to know how Dyson obtained this result so I looked up the paper that Dyson eventually published for this derivation, but I found it difficult to understand.

But I continued learning quantum field theory. I don’t even think I thought of deriving Dyson’s result as a project for myself, but a year later, in January of 2010 it seemed that I had learned enough QFT to start doing so. I worked on it throughout IAP on and off and ultimately completed it by the end of spring break. I was only able to complete the calculation using modern quantum field theory (a la, Peskin and Schroeder) rather than old quantum field theory (a la, Heitler and Dirac), so I wasn’t able to precisely confirm Dyson’s result. But near the end of the project, I found a paper by Jehle and Rohlic which performed this spin zero lamb shift calculation using the methods of modern field theory, and reassuringly, I found that the paper’s result matched my onw. 

The entire arc of this journey was inspiring for me. The way one could begin with very vague notions of a problem and its solution and then watch over time as those notions evolve into something more concrete and something real in the world independent of your own engagement with it. The way one can actually see oneself improving and getting closer to some thing by the simple fact that the questions one could barely even formulate months ago are now yielding answers which lead to even more uncertain terrain. The project was not a new inquiry into physics; it had been solved at least twice before, the first time by Dyson and the second time by Jehle/Rohlich. But it is still one of the things I am most proud of accomplishing. 

It is strange how history can repeat itself in its general outlines if not in the specific events which define it. During my time in New Orleans from 2013-2014, I learned Python in order to at least partly make up for all the programming instruction I missed out on at MIT.

 make up for the deplorable deficiency in programming knowledge. When I started Harvard in the fall of 2014, I took a Data Science course which I had so enjoyed that I decided to take another computation course the following semester. The course covered the methods of stochastic optimization and through it, I learned about metropolis sampling, control of variates, simulated annealing, parallel tempering, and many other computational techniques that I can now hardly recall. In one assignment, we were asked to use the metropolis algorithm to solve what I thereafter termed the “IMDB problem”. A group of people is initially given an ordered list of the five most popular movies on the IMDB (Internet Movie Database). Days later they are tasked with reproducing this ordered list, but some of them have forgotten the initial ordering. If we take \vec{\omega} to represent the initial ordered list and \vec{\theta} to be the list a person guesses after a few days, then the probability of the person guessing a list of \vec{\theta}






where I_A is 1 if A is true and 0 if A is false. \lambda can be considered a measure of how reliable the person’s memory is. For example, for \lambda very large the person has a very reliable memory and mistakes in their guessed ordering are unlikely. For the problem we were supposed to use metropolis sampling to answer two questions: What are the five most likely guesses of orderings (for a given value of lambda)? And what is the probability, as a function of lambda, that a person guessed the first movie in the list correctly? 

The first question is quite easy to answer analytically as well as stochastically. For the analytic solution we know that \vec{\omega} is the most likely guess since its probability is not exponentially damped, and the other four guesses are drawn from single step permutations of \vec{\omega} (that is, permutations which only switch two of the elements in the ordering). To answer the question stochastically, you use the metropolis algorithm to generate a distribution of samples according to the stated probability function and then you collect the five most frequent orderings of elements. 

The second question has a straightforward stochastic solution: you generate many samples and then you  divide the number of samples with a correct first element by the number of total samples. But I couldn’t see clearly how one would solve the problem analytically. I believed an analytic solution should be possible because the probability looked so much like the ones I had seen in statistical mechanics. I had completed the assignment as it was written, but I was still bothered by the fact that an analytic solution wasn’t coming to me. The problem kept me up one night and I remember leaving my bed  and sitting at my desk stumbling towards what I thought was a solution. I plotted the solution analytically against the stochastic results and it was wrong. I looked back at the solution and reasoned another way through it, and plotted it again; wrong again. I went through a few iterations of this until I found something which was consistent with the stochastic results and was also analytically sound. 

At the moment when I plotted the final analytic prediction against the stochastic one and found good agreement, I felt incredibly proud. My intuitions were right, an analytic solution (although a rather ugly one at the time) was indeed possible. I spent the next day, writing up the result in a flurry so I could submit it with my assignment. I don’t know why I felt as though I absolutely had to submit the unasked-for analytic solution along with the computational solution which was the crux of the problem (and indeed the course), but, in honesty, I think I was partly trying to show-off. 

It is worth mentioning that while it took me about three pages of careful manipulations to explain the analytic solution back then, I can now provide an explanation of the solution in a few lines. Such is the result when you develop a deeper understanding of a question and thereby find the simplest and most natural analytical language by which to present it.

After I solved the problem analytically and wrote up the solution, I was still somewhat unsatisfied. The main issue was that my solution was much too specific to the problem as it was stated and seemed difficult to generalize. I remember asking myself if it was possible to find a solution when there was not simply an ordered list of five elements but of N elements. I called this question, after the problem assignment which inspired it, “The IMDB problem”. I wrote this query in a notebook, of which only a page remains.  Here is a word-for-word transcript of that page

IMDB Statistical Model
First, where does this model come from?

Second through simulations you saw that the variation in any result scaled as 1/N\lambda, I think the true scaling is N_p/N\lambda where N_p is the number of permutations/states which are possible [and N is the number of steps in the simulation]. In order to have good results we need N_p/N\lambda << 1. Can we prove why this is the case?


*Lana Del Rey <-> First Aid Kit
Ryan Reynolds Film <-> Intro Music Cool

“Having been such a weird kid and such an outsider, I’m comfortable being in that place, and I think if you’re comfortable being an outsider and you embrace it, the likelihood is much higher that you’re going to [work to] please yourself and not other people and therefore that work will stand out and be compelling.”

Authors @ Google


The line about Lana Del Rey refers to some similarity I saw in her voice and the voices of the duo that made up First Aid Kit. I have no idea what the Ryan Reynolds line refers to. 

More on point: Both the quote from Aisha and my questions proved to be vaguely prophetic. First, you’ll note that I never answered either question associated with the “IMDB model”. I did later ask Verena (the instructor for the course) where the model came from, but she told me it was just a homework assignment. And my later work on the problem was not at all concerned with the simulation properties of the question, but with a general analytic solution.

Nevertheless as I spent the subsequent months working on the project, I kept this page attached to my calendar and glanced at it (but never actually read it) from time to time, believing that it had set the star by which my efforts were guided. I had believed, through the work I was doing, I was answering the question the paper posed, but it now seems that my mind was simply engaging in the typical revisionist habit of reinterpreting the goals of the past in terms of objectives of the present. 

But beyond the stated (and ultimately ignored) objective concerning the problem, what truly gave me solidity for my future work was Aisha’s statement about outisders. I, in almost every environment I have been in, have always felt like one, have always felt like the space I was occupying was made for someone who was not me. And yes, OK, race has something to do with it but it is not everything because these some of these spaces were not the traditional spaces of entitlement and parochialism our society cannot help but create, but were spaces any naive inspection would indicate that I might feel most welcome. I felt out of place and foreign at Ben Franklin Elementary, and Edna Karr, and at Nu Delta. But fortunately this sense of apartness never destroyed me as it surely could have. I will neither claim that it had made me stronger, because really how could I know what I would have been had the acceptance been there and clearly communicated?

But that was back then. Here I was at Harvard trying to start a professional career while deep in the throes of “impostor syndrome.” Except I knew the truth of how this phrase applied more correctly to me than possibly to my peers. There is of course the question of whether one is “good enough” to be at this place, but that was not my question, as it may have been for others. The deeper question for me concerned one of culture and personality because what most likely determines whether someone will find a place for him or herself within a community is if the person already has, or eventually develops, values already consistent with those of the community. And not even considering their academic abilities, which I feel I have no right to judge, my peers seemed willing to at least try to fit themselves into the existing structure of research rotations, communal psetting, Monday Tea and colloquia, social hours, etc. I had tried these things once and realized I couldn’t, for whatever reason, do them again. 



I know it is narcissism in a way to see yourself as alone and apart from all ambient communities. And I know everyone to some extent feels different from everyone else, but they all—the ones who were visible to me anyway—seemed to be bolstered and made stronger by one another in a way I felt I could not be.

So I was finding myself again as an outsider. Not to mention, I had tried looking over the research problems Harvard faculty were working on but my eyes always just glazed over in boredom. None of them were interesting to me, and the thought of committing myself to any projects in those domains felt like considering whether to leap into a hole whose bottom I could not see. I of course knew that I had, in a way, made a mistake by coming to Harvard. The mistake was made partly from inertia because after I had failed to summon the nerve to kill myself, I had lost all will to make any personally willful decisions and simply took my cues from my environment. My father had expected me to go, so I went. And my ambivalence, although strangely not reflected in my coursework that first year, was certainly clear in how I engaged, or rather failed, to engage with the Harvard physics community
 
And yet I also knew something deeper about belonging, I knew that one does not need to feel like one belongs, one need not even really “belong” in any evidential sense of the word, in order to exist positively in an environment. I had somehow done it in Nu Delta, used my differing conception of pledge training to justify why I should be pledge trainer and thereby inculcate a new class of Brothers in ideals I felt previous classes were missing. So Aisha’s words rang very true to me. I knew that being an outsider was only a superficially negative state, and that one could often use the fringe benefits of that status—the differing perspective, the solitude and mental clarity such solitude sometimes engenders—to do something “compelling”.

After my first year at Harvard, this is what I sought to do. In June of 2015, I started a new LaTex document called “Personal Problems”. It was a daughter document to my previous “Stupid Problems” and “Better Problems” documents where I had tried to devise physics projects I could work on myself. The first problem I wrote down was an analytic phrasing of the IMDB problem from the Stochastic Optimization assignment. I had solved this problem, but because I sought to generalize it, I wanted to keep it somewhat at the forefront of my mind. Under the stated problem I wrote a few questions I wanted to answer:

Extra Questions to Supplement: 
- Is there a large N limit to this solution? - What is the order parameter of this system? - Does the model exhibit a phase transition? - If we make the couplings probabilistic, can we analyze the system as a spin glass? - Is the model dual to any common statistical mechanics problem? 


Back then I had no idea how to answer any of these questions, but I believed they should have an answer for this system because there were answers for other systems formulated in a similar way. 

I spent the summer and the remaining months of the year adding more and more problems to the “personal problems” document, solving them, and writing up their solutions. The document grew and grew and with the document’s growth I felt myself growing in my abilities to pose and solve problems. Eventually, around November/December of 2015, I started focusing again on generalizing the solution to the IMDB problem. I worked out the solution for N=1, 2, 3, and 4 and eventually found a better way to represent the problem. I kept calculating various things, finding relations between partition functions and coefficients, calculating and calculating and generating more and more questions. Eventually, I had answered enough interesting questions that I decided that the work was substantial enough to serve as a project. This was in early 2016 perhaps a month after I had returned from New Orleans and had seen all my old physics notebooks, so neglected and so filled with pages and pages of equations. I had looked through these notebooks in a daze, having completely forgotten how much work I had done during high school and at MIT. Sitting in my room, at that moment I realized that I had deeply betrayed the boy represented by those pages, and although I would have liked to blame Jesse, MIT, Amir, and Harvard for that betrayal ultimately it came down to the decisions I made, regardless of whether I felt those decisions were at the mercy of institutions which held my future for ransom. 

I was quite angry after looking at those notebooks. I had failed to adequately respect their implicit promise, and I had lost so much time trapped in visions of self loathing seen through eyes foisted upon me. That anger was amplified again and again many times after that winter break, and here I am now with a draft of part of the thermal permutations project (what the “IMDB project” ultimately turned into) complete. It was incredibly difficult to get to this point, but I know I still have more to go. 


And I know that I must remind myself that Aisha’s words are more explicit and narrow than an inspirational narrative may take them to be. Because although she states that one’s work will “stand out” and “be compelling” she does not state that one will be recognized or rewarded for one’s work or that one will in someway be made existentially complete through it. These are lessons that I have been slow to realize, and I think that any honest accounting of authenticity and integrity should, if not explicitly mention the social alienation which can result from it, not pretend that such authenticity will be ultimately lauded by the communities which previously questioned its relevance.

The class of 2013 at Nu Delta was largely a class composed of fraternal outcasts. Very few of us integrated comfortably into the existing structure of Nu Delta but each failed at this integration in ways unique and yet ultimately predictable.



Lessons from Thermal Permutations 

Follow the Mathematics: There is a quote by Feynman which I felt was simultaneously inspirational and challenge posing.

’Let me also say something that people who worry about mathematical proofs and inconsistencies seem not to know. There is no way of showing mathematically that a physical conclusion is wrong or inconsistent. All that can be shown is that the mathematical assumptions are wrong. If we find that certain mathematical assumptions lead to a logically inconsistent description of Nature, we change the assumptions, not nature.' 

The challenge of course is—as it always is—the change. The necessity of letting go of one’s initial biases and prejudices when they are shown to contradict reality as it presents itself. Feynman is arguing for something I had always summarized as “Every physical investigation must begin and end with the physical phenomena.” Namely that, as a physicist, one must ultimately stay faithful to one’s goals of trying to describe nature. Mathematical formalisms may be beautiful and inspiring but ultimately they must be relinquished, from the perspective of the mid 20th century physicist, if they are found to be inconsistent with nature. 

Of course string theorists will argue this point, and at this level the argument is largely academic. Other physicists can reasonably argue that what string theorists are doing is not ‘physics’ but this argument is largely beside the point. The deeper and more relevant question is whether their work has epistemic value and I think it is fair to say that it does independent of what label is ultimately assigned to it. This value may be one currently antithetical to what has historically been seen as the tacit spirit of physics but it is a value which exists nonetheless. 

Perhaps, I have softened my perspective on string theory for reasons less altruistic and humbling than they seem. Because of course I still am not as in love with the theory as other physicists are (or were), but what I am realizing is that there is value in the mathematical extrapolation of a theory even if that extrapolation does not have physical relevance. Does this mean I am turning into a mathematical physicist? A mediocre mathematician? What seems clear is that although I have always seen myself as a physicist (someone who had fidelity to the physical world), my inclinations seem to be pulling me elsewhere.

That is somewhat tangential to the point I’m trying to develop here. What I wanted to say is that in the same way Feynman claims one should change his assumptions in constructing a physical theory when said assumptions are found to contradict nature, I think one should change their motivating idea for a mathematical investigation when that idea is proven to be intractable or when another more natural idea is available. 

I had to this a few times in this work. I would ask a question, having some idea of an answer and would attempt to work out the mathematics in the direction of this answer. Sometimes it would work and other times it didn’t, and when it didn’t I eventually had to abandon my original question and try to look at the work as it was and determine what questions I should be asking. This is what led me the integral solution to the PDE model and to looking more closely at the phase space properties of the system. 

The generalized lesson here is that one should follow the mathematics of one’s work and be willing to ask whatever question can move the work forward even if said question differs from the inciting idea for the work. 

A Better Mathematician: 

This investigation has made me realize that for the work I want to do in the future (in particular the “Stokes Theorem and QFT” project), I will need to become a better mathematician. I’m not sure what this means in general, but for my purposes, it means I need to become better at working logically and cleanly through a mathematical argument, without recourse to the “physicist-like” approximations which riddle most of my current work. One way to do this is to practice thinking more carefully about the mathematics of all the work (i.e., the teaching notes, the personal problems, the modules, etc.) and also to assign myself conceptually and analytically difficult mathematical calculations which will force me to be less imprecise in my mathematical work. 

Another way to improve my ability to work through mathematical arguments concerns one practice that I’ve been trying to incorporate into my work. I’ve recently become better at reducing complex ideas (like renormalization and quenched disorder) to simple toy models which bear the essence of the idea without an intimidating mathematical infrastructure. I usually stop at the (mathematically simple) toy model in this work, but I should be using the intuition gleaned from this toy model to ask and answer more sophisticated questions. This I think would be the useful practice: develop simple models based on complex ideas but then use those toy models as motivation for something more physically/mathematically interesting. 

Take aways
Do not skimp on the mathematical rigor of your physics lessons, modules, and personal problems (Practice the way you want to perform)
Work on conceptually and/or analytically difficult calculations to practice rigor.
Engage in the simple example/complex example framing of an idea. 


Projects Take a Long Time (Jesse was right): 

At one point, I told Jesse that my plans for a semester (or was it a summer?) were to complete one or two projects. I think I remember him laughing. He then sought to renormalize my expectations by claiming that it took about six months to learn enough about a field to do something interesting within it, and then it took another six months to write a paper, and that in general it’s a bad idea to work on multiple projects at once. I was not convinced; if what he was saying were explicitly true then given when he started publishing papers, he could not have published as many papers as he did. 

Still, Jesse seemed to have been right about projects taking times much longer than you may want them to take. I think I also recall him saying at one point, that the projects you think are easy often become rather challenging to complete and the projects you think are hard border on impossibility. This too appears to be true. 

I had planned to finish this particular project by the start of March, but it took me until the end of April to complete a first draft of the work, and it is still not (but hopefully close to!) where it would need to be for a publication. 

It is not clear what lesson I should extrapolate from this. Perhaps, it is that I should be more realistic about the typical lifetime of a project and instead of believing some work will take a month, as I may hope it will, recognize that it will take many more. Or maybe I should relinquish this idea of “suppose to” and be willing to take as long as I need to in order to complete a project. Because, really, what took me so long to complete this project was that the project kept growing in useful directions I had not originally anticipated. The project kept expanding and the material I felt needed to be included in the final document kept growing as well, and so of course writing up the work took longer than I initially believed necessary. 


Biasing your environment works and is necessary

I proceeded through multiple cycles in trying to complete and write up this work. I can’t remember too much about the first cycles other than that they were characterized by daily task lists and intermittent periods of binge watching TV series. I should admit, I did make progress in the work during these cycles, but, as I have written elsewhere, I still felt I could (and should) be doing more each day. This was not the simple dissatisfaction that exists as the background to all efforts and thus could never be eradicated. That is, this was a discontent not at all existential and was instead something which mirrored a problem I could actually fix. 

I “fixed” it by not watching TV series, movies, or listening to podcasts. Eliminating these forms of media from my intellectual diet was difficult because I had very much become addicted to them, but doing so seemed to have the effect of creating some additional intellectual space for my work. After a few days, I seemed not to need any task list. Each morning I woke up immediately cognizant of what I needed to do and then I simply started doing it. Throughout the day, I alternated periods of work with reading Another Country and online news articles, and at night I often worked until I went to sleep. 

Something which I seemed incapable of realizing because so much of my experience was to the contrary (Of course it wasn’t actually to the contrary I just lived as though it was) was that physics is really difficult and in order to do something in it you have to think long and hard in much the same way one has to think long and hard about oneself in order to have any hope of personal change. And although you could probably get on quite well through a physics course with a reduced degree of focus, I have found it somewhat impossible to do anything deeper than excelling at externally prescribed academic standards, with the same modicum of attention.

Attention is really the important thing. In The Brother’s K David James Duncan likened doing work to digging ever and ever deeper into some subterranean space others do not occupy. For my work, I find that in order to find something interesting in an initial question or in order to push a question forward I need to spend a lot of time in this space and constantly work to move deeper into it. Watching TV or movies (or even listening to podcasts) can pull you out of this space, and make it more difficult to return to a previous depth when you return. Even working on multiple disconnected projects has a way of jumbling you and making the pursuit of depth much more difficult (For example, I had to complete this project before I could dedicate the necessary attention to the “Missing Curriculum in Problem Solving Education” essay)

The lesson, then, is that if you want to complete a project, you need to limit the extraneous information (the TV, movies, podcasts, other projects) you take in while you’re working on it. Most forms of digital media can distract you from the work and make it more difficult to not only complete, but also more difficult to get any insights which would make the work better. 

There is also something not specifically utilitarian about this approach to work. Somehow removing certain experiences from one’s cognitive diet has a way of settling one into a space of relative cognitive clarity. These two weeks of work were the closest I’ve come this year to achieving that thing called inner peace. The feeling was transformative, if not merely for what it did to me in the moment but also for how it revealed a possible engagement with the world that I had not believed was possible for me . 


There are two elements of this biasing that I should highlight. 

Work on one major project at a time: As mentioned above I had to complete (at least partially) the thermal permutations project before I could start writing the “Missing curriculum in Problem Solving Education” essay.  In the past, I think failing to focus on one major project at a time riddled my efforts to complete and focus on projects and made necessary the loathsome task list. As it turns out I really don’t have the mental agility to move from a deep and successful engagement with one thing, to the same level of engagement with another. In fact, it takes time to settle into the mental space in which it becomes easy to concentrate on the work and to develop novel insights into it. So, while I’m working on a project (like building the material for a formal paper or developing an essay), it’s best to limit devotion to other projects similar in scope. 

Deadlines and Ultimatums: This work would not have been completed without focus—not to mention faith, patience, and a daily application of all three—and what really helped me focus was the decision to not watch TV series, movies, or listen to podcasts until I satisfied the basic markers for what was necessary in the work. Not only did abstaining from such media increase the so called “intellectual space” needed to do the work, but it also gave me an incentive for completing it quickly. Each night I translated my desire to watch a movie or a TV series into hours of work because I had stipulated doing the latter was the requirement for getting to experience the former. I was able to do this for about two and a half weeks—which I think is the longest I’ve ever abstained from such things. 



Importance of Context

Context is important in two ways: First in a way which has a simple analogy in writing. The idea in writing is that whatever story exists in the writer’s explicitly written work should represent only 5% of what the writer knows about the characters and their history. This, I think, is to ensure that the characters have a reality approximating the complex reality of actual human beings. 

This “smaller explicit context vs. larger unstated context” seems to have a clear counterpart in research. The work that I ultimately wrote down and defined as the “Model of Thermal Permutations” project was only a portion of the epistemic space I explored in developing the project. This of course was inevitable because it was really only by exploring that I was led to the more interesting questions which I made form the backbone of the project. 

The second way context is important is in defining the motivation for the work. It is naive of me to think that when someone reads my paper they will immediately decide to dedicate time to working through the more formal (and arguably more interesting) aspects of it. Even I do not work this way. Professor Silvera told me that he typically reads papers by first perusing the abstract and the conclusion (and maybe even the introduction?) and then deciding if more time should be dedicated to them. So it is absolutely necessary (if you want your work to be read by an audience) to be as solid in these parts of the work as in the main text. Namely, the motivation for the work needs to be sufficiently interesting that one would feel it is worth his or her time to devote more effort to reading the body of the paper.  

The lessons are twofold.

Exploration is key in developing a project. Have some initial questions you want to answer, but don’t feel beholden to them, and continue trying to extend the project in new directions. 

Also, do not skimp on providing the context and motivation for the work. Clearly, you should not conjure up a motivation which does not seem natural in the work itself, but you should sufficiently embed the work in a narrative which justifies—or, more ambitiously, demands—its existence so that someone believes it is worth it to read. 


Flexible Intent

When I started this project I called it the IMDB problem because of its starting point as the extension of the problem in the AM207 assignment. Later I realized what I was really dealing with was a model of thermally distributed permutations, and even now I am getting the sense that the work is pointing in another direction. In all of this I had to be sufficiently committed to a perspective on the problem to generate questions to better understand it while also being sufficiently flexible to recognize when the answers to those questions were leading me in a new direction. I’ve had this experience before with the project on the Data Science of Video Game Reviews, and I know there are historical examples of this perspective as well (see for example, Root-Bernstein’s example in “How Scientists Really Think” of Fleming’s discovery of lysozome). 

The takeaway: You have to be willing relinquish the questions you want to answer for the questions which are present and natural in the work in its then current state. 

Sharing Makes it Better

Or having an audience makes your work better. I realized this when I was writing up these results. In large part, although the ideas were more or less established before I started writing, attempting to present these ideas in a way that they were understandable and well motivated led me to a question I had previously never considered. This question in-turn led to the most interesting figure in the work (the phase diagram picture). Not to mention the standard fact that attempting to cohesively and narratively write up one’s work leads one to an understanding more solid than simply doing the work itself. 

This lesson is basically a plug for trying your best to show your work to others. If you have an idea and you want to improve it, you should write up the idea with the goal of presenting it to other people. 

You’re Improving: 

Rather than a lesson for improvement, this is a self-congratulatory note.

I think it is fair to say you’re getting better at this “being a physicist” thing. The “personal problems” document is largely a continuation of your “Stupid Questions” document, and it seems that while it had proved really difficult to come up with interesting questions and nearly impossible to answer them back then, you are now much more adept at posing and answering questions yourself. It seems all that time you spent trying to understand the process of problem formulation and doing creative work in physics was not at all wasted. 

You previously stated that you needed to have faith in your ability to improve. Now with that improvement placed before your eyes, should it be easier to have faith in further improvement?


Find the Question No One is Asking

In previous iterations of this “lessons from physics projects” series, I tried to extrapolate a general method to come up with good project ideas. Eventually, I got to the point where I said a good project idea only had to be new; By exploring this new question, it would eventually evolve into something substantial and worthy of investigating. Another way to frame this is to advocate that you should find the question that no one else is asking, the gap in the narrative no one else can see. Such a question could lead to something interesting; it could of course also lead to something quite useless, but you wouldn’t know unless you investigate it first. 

The point about context is important here. When you develop a new question and the question is interesting to you, it is important to try to make the question interesting to other people. Namely, to try to connect that new question to a more global motivation. 

The Lesson Here: Don’t be afraid to ask the question no one else is asking. 

Importance of Courage (Jesse was wrong)

The stories we construct retrospectively to explain the events of our lives are never accurate to the feelings which defined these events for they are removed from the context and the associated uncertainty which are crucial to any sense of emotional fidelity. Still, the stories can tell us something (if not everything) about what we were like at those long ago moments when they were lived and not yet written down. Say I tell you that, although I am still in the midst of the journey which defines this project, starting the project and continuing it required a constant and daily overcoming of the external and internal messages which urged me to drop it and do something else? This statement is no longer something I have to live, and you, reading it, look at it with a detachment that I could not have mustered. But the lesson, no matter how minimized by the context of your current safety, is there if you are willing to live it. 

All of this is to say, that working on this project and submitting it to professors for review required a personal courage that I have many times spoken of but many more times refused to actualize. The courage I realize was there and had to be there for me to do anything because I was deeply afraid, although I was so in a way I had seldom acknowledged. 

The situations which necessitated this courage were always present, and they seemed to be waiting for me to step forward and engage with them not based on the threats they presented but on their potential rewards. Because although “Here be Dragons” is a warning we should often heed, the waring is only honestly framed when we consider not merely the dragons themselves but also what lies beyond them. 

In a longer essay below, I’ve written out exactly why I think Jesse was wrong. I recognize he was trying to help me and give me advice. But I also realize that his advice—like the advice so many other well-meaning people have given me—was not a response voiced after a prior measured inspection of who the advisee was, but was almost unilaterally derived from his own insecurities, life experiences, and how he saw the world. How, reasonably, could I live my life under such prescriptions, hemmed in and limited by the ranges of other people’s ignorance? 

Thus, there is something in me which deeply appreciates Jesse and which simultaneously recognizes how wrong he was about me and, perhaps, about physics. In a word, the appreciation is complicated, as I think it should be if it is to exist consistently with a complicated world.

The threats are there, as they always will be. They should be outlined and understood (this is to say, reality should be met on one’s own terms before reality meets one on its terms), but the evaluation of the threat and whether the objective which lies beyond it is worthy of it should be made personally. This is where courage comes in and I know that if I want to be able to access this courage in the future, I need to practice it today, not merely when I am an experienced graduate student, not merely when I have tenure, but right now at the only moment my current agency can affect. 

This is something I know will be difficult for me as I am predisposed to be timid and demurring. A lifetime of social obscurity has inculcated in me the belief that I am not worthy of the goals I aspire to. Conversely, the characteristically privileged (not only with regard to race, class, and/or gender but in terms of looks, personality, etc.) seem to move through the world with greater self-assurance than most others. You look at them and wonder if this preternatural confidence comes from something they did or something they think they are, and you ultimately decide that the question is moot for no matter the source the benefits are undeniable. 

I know I cannot attain the presumptive and status-based version of this confidence since to me its falseness is clear, but I know I can build the more solid version of this confidence, the one which comes from a history of action, by constantly exercising the courage which is its antecedent. It would require me to acknowledge when I am afraid, and to evaluate the risks and rewards and act not merely based on an external evaluation of the former but based on a personal comparison of both.

With regard to my work the charge is to not pursue projects based on an external measure of viability, but to personally and carefully inspect the details of the work and understand the potential it contains. 

Also, this has relevance with regard to the types of projects I complete. I think I can proficiently complete many of the education lessons I have outlined and I will certainly find value in the resulting work. 

But largely this is safe territory. It is paved land where I know there is a path (if even a new one) to a destination because others have found the destination long ago. Undoubtedly there is value in such work and you should complete it, but the danger is that you can unconsciously limit yourself to only engaging in this type of work because you believe it is the only work you can do. 

But it is not the only work you can do. There is a type of work which is risky and uncertain and in whose fruition lies not only the potential of an interesting discovery but also the potential expansion of your cognitive world and agency. These are the projects where there is intuition without the solid worldly evidence to justify it. And just as you should value the more clear cut projects where you are rather sure an answer exists, you should also value the less defined projects which lead you far away from traveled territory and force you to engage more fully with the chaos of the world. 

Projects In this Direction
Evolution, Genes, Master Equation, and Game Theory: Is there a way to encapsulate or explain genetic diversity mathematically by studying evolution with the master equation and game theory?
The idea is that the outcome of a game is like the energy function in statistical mechanics, and the sequences of genes evolve according to which sequences are associated with improved strategies and hence a higher likelihood to win a game. 
Fractals and Yang Mills Theory: The ideas which define self similarity (i.e., scale invariance) seem to be related to the ideas which define the renormalization group properties of the Yang-Mills field. Is there a way to express the properties of the Yang-Mills field through the language of fractals?
QFT and Economic Collapse: Economic collapse is arguably something which should not happen in a well functioning economic system. If we relate a well functioning economic system to a classical system, can the conditions of economic collapse be related to a quantum system where processes which are forbidden in the well-functioning context arise when that context doesn’t exist?
Long Distance Ultra-relativistic Rocket Travel: You found the interesting result that under the assumption of mass conservation of the rocket (as opposed to explicit energy conservation), that the rocket achieves theoretically higher velocities and hence given the same amount of fuel (by mass) can achieve longer distances for space travel. Is this a physical assumption? That is, is it really possible for a rocket moving at ultra-relativistic speeds to get to those speeds through a mass-conserving fuel process rather than an energy conserving one?
Rényi Entropy and Simulated Annealing: Motivated by the Tsallis definition of entropy, I wonder is there a way to study stimulated annealing through the Rényi Entropy. Try to find a type of problem this technique is adept at solving that other methods of simulated annealing cannot solve. 
Differential Forms, Volumes, and Functional Integrals: Gaussian integrals can be expressed as determinants which in turn are relevant to the definition of volume. The true goal of this project is to express Stokes Theorem in terms of Gaussian integrals and to use the expression to derive a result for functional integrals. 
Search Strategies and Entropy: It is possible to connect the binary search strategy to Shannon Entropy. Are there entropic definitions of other search strategies? If we assume entropy has this form, what are the theoretical properties of these entropies and what physical results emerge when we assume a physical system is governed by them. 

As always, for these projects you need to first and foremost compute something which is concrete and use this concrete calculation as a foundation for questions and calculations in other directions. 
Takeaway: Don’t fall into the habit of making small project bets. That is, don’t only work on projects that you are absolutely sure you can complete. Periodically move into uncertain territory where you think (but are not absolutely certain) you will find something interesting. 

(Also don’t become so egocentric that you believe you can complete any difficult project, that you are god’s gift to humanity, that you’re better than anyone else, etc. etc. etc.)

Remainders

You can measure a man’s commitment to his goals by how much he is willing to sacrifice to achieve them. But perhaps it is not saying much because often he is willing to sacrifice things which he never really valued but which he had pretended to value without realizing he was pretending.

The characteristically privileged seem to move through the world with greater self-assurance than most others. You look at them and wonder if this preternatural confidence comes from something they did or something they think they are. (and ultimately you decide the answer is irrelevant, because the confidence looks the same in both cases) 

If I cannot attain this type of confidence, I need to at least simulate its existence by constantly exercising the courage which is its antecedent. Stepping forward when I am afraid, speaking when I think I may be ignored, acting even when I feel I the world has not granted me the agency to do so. 

I spent the last two weeks working on a somewhat straight forward project in statistical physics and on a 10 page essay that I started months (honestly, years) ago, and completing all this work took more focus than I have mustered in two years at Harvard. How then can I reasonably envision completing all the projects and other work I feel I must complete?

May 12, 2016 - Thursday 12:10 AM

I just returned from saying farewell to Dat. He’s going to Vietnam for a 15 month stay to conduct research. It’s actually more of a series of five month stays because he’ll be back in October for a month and then again in February for a month and then back for good in July. I don’t know why I’m detailing this. It’s not like we’re in a relationship according to any typical definition of what being “in a relationship” means. But beyond this definition, it is clear that we certainly have a relationship, and it was my recognition of this which made me reverse my decision to stay away tonight. 

Earlier in the afternoon, I told him I couldn’t make it to see him tonight. I’m not sure why I said this. It was the middle of the day and I was tired, yes. But I was also angry, angry about all the relationships which had nothing at all to do with Dat. And like the boy in Wesley Yang’s perceptive essay “The Face of Seung-Hui-Cho”, I was perhaps lashing out at the world by trying to hurt the only person who had gotten closest to me. But part of me, I later realized, was scared. I’m not entirely sure of what, but I recognize that the fear was there because I had to overcome something which felt like fear in order to finally text him again and ask if he was still free. 

Ultimately, there was a larger fear which propelled me forward. It was the fear of continuing to be who I in the past seldom failed to be: a bystander to my own life. The passive route was to just let Dat drift away, and it was so easy to take, in fact I was already on it and was being silently propelled along it by time. But there was deep personal violence, even if only of the quiet invisible kind, in that direction, and I knew this because I had walked it for so long. And in an anger, I texted Dat, and thereby tried to jump onto a different route before it was too late. 

Agency. It’s strange to see it so naked in one’s life. The way it can change courses and narratives even in the same context in which it seemed so previously lacking in potency as to be irrelevant. But we must not be misled, these innocuous moments which do not seem to leap at us with potential, still have potential therein. It might be one which will require some activity on our part, but this is no over-large hurdle when we acknowledge our agency. 

It was good seeing Dat again. He gave me a plant (which I am naming “Clover”) and it is sitting on the window sill in the living room. On the bus back to Harvard Square, a woman told me the plant was a philodendron and that it was very robust and should not be overwatered (things Dat told me as well). This was our fourth “date” or “outing” whatever. The first one was at a movie theatre where we watched Cloverfield 10. After the movie we walked from Loews Theatre, through Boston Common, along Mass Ave until Commonwealth. Then we continued on the Esplanade in the direction of BU. Ultimately we walked to his place on Packard’s corner and I said goodbye. The next one was at the Paramount Theatre at Emerson College where we watched a series of short films (unoriginally called Sex Shorts) about queer prostitution. The third date had us meeting on Boylston street and walking to a Middle Eastern restaurant where we had dinner, and then to Pinkberry, and then to MIT where I showed him around MIT’s Center for Theoretical Physics, the Infinite Corridor, and the Stata Center. We then went back to his place where we lay in bed doing nothing. 

 How strange the month of April was! How strange this year has been!

Meeting with Suzanne
I met with Suzanne today. She said she greatly enjoyed the essay and that she agreed with my thesis that there is indeed something missing in problem solving education. Interestingly enough, she said she encounters the problem I described in the history classes she teaches. This surprised me because I expected the structure of assignments in humanities classes to give students much more freedom in formulating paper topics on their own and would thus make them more adept at identifying gaps in networks of knowledge. 

Suzanne explained that when students had the opportunity to write a free form essay, they often rehashed a topic they had seen before. She said it was difficult to teach students that in order to write anything, you quite simply need to have something to write about, that is, you need to have some problem you want to engage with. My essay had relevance, beyond physics, because it raised questions concerning how to improve the pedagogy of not only science courses but humanities and general education courses as well. 

She also mentioned that there was actually a step which came prior to identifying a need/inconsistency/confusion, the first step of my so-called “real problem-solving process”. To motivate this step for me, she gave me an article (the famous article, it turned out) by Samuel H. Schudder, a 19th century entomologist (entomology: study of insects). In the article, Shudder describes how one of his early mentors instructed him in the inestimable value of careful and unhurried observation, simply trying to see and, in a way, know an object by merely focusing on it and paying attention to it. After reading the article, I turned to Suzanne and said, somewhat simplistically, “Ahh, so the first step is careful observation.” She tried to clarify. Beyond simple observation, she suggested the first step concerned a sort of quiet and patient existing with the object of study ever before any premature attempt at analysis.

In my own language, I would say the observation which characterizes this new step is akin to becoming sufficiently familiar with a space of knowledge to be cognizant of gaps in it. Less formally, it simply begins with observing and trying to see (perhaps not even attempting to understand at first) what there is to possibly see.

It took me some hours after the meeting to realize she had indirectly lead me to a solution to a problem I have had for a long time. Ever since I started interrogating the research process, one question loomed very large for me: How do you generate problems? I eventually decided that generating problems was something which could be done successively, by asking new and simple questions which lead you away from established terrain and then gradually allowing those questions to metastasize and grow until you have a more substantial problem than you started with. I think this is mostly correct, but there really is something which comes before asking a question in the first place. Before you have any idea of what exactly constitutes a new question, you have to have some sense of the old questions, indeed some sense of knowledge which defines the old questions. Understanding what these old questions are involves existing within the space of old knowledge long enough that you see things you didn’t see originally.

I realize this explanation is largely a reinterpretation of Suzanne’s point for my own purposes. What she perhaps really means is paying attention, not necessarily to the knowledge which already exists, but to the phenomena that knowledge is meant to frame. But I am a theorist, I tell myself, and although I pay lip service to wanting to deal with phenomena, I’m really a lover of abstraction and equations. Still, I think there is perhaps space for both focuses (the old knowledge and the phenomena). In the preface to Maxwell’s treatise, he stated that when he began working on electricity and magnetism, he resolved to read no mathematics on the subject until he had a sense (mostly from Faraday’s work) of what phenomena he was trying to understand. It seems he did not want to be led astray and he had sufficient confidence in his own mathematical abilities that given whatever phenomena he found was relevant to electricity and magnetism, he knew he would be able to model it effectively. 

I personally have the opposite tendency, running headlong into abstraction and symbols as soon as I find a way to do so. Suzanne’s suggestion of the zeroth step of the problem solving process and Maxwell’s example provide indication enough that there is a better way to engage with problems. I tell myself that in order to do my work I need patience, focus, and faith; patience to continue working even when the work is not completed as soon as I want it to be; focus to keep my mind on the work when other things attempt to pull me away from it; faith that the work will be completed when and in the way it can be completed. This too is consistent with a reframing of the problem solving process, and my hope is that I can finally recognize the truth of this reframing and incorporate it into my work. 

P.S. Suzanne said that we should meet later to discuss ways to incorporate my ideas on problem solving into the new graduate center for writing.

Importance of Courage, II
I have documented this before, but it has recently revealed itself to be true in a way I had always anticipated but had never experienced. After about a year into my work with Jesse, I suggested three project ideas to him (They were the “Gravity is Different”, “Wilson Lines and Effective Actions”, and “Stokes Theorem and QFT” projects). The ideas were incredibly vague and were divorced from any specific mathematical context to make them explicit. But I thought they were all incredibly interesting, and I was thinking about them at a time when I was feeling less and less inspired by the work Jesse was assigning me to do.

Jesse patiently considered the ideas in turn, asking me questions about them, and not making any snide comments when I revealed, again and again, my ignorance of the surrounding fields. But ultimately he said the projects were too difficult, and that they were the kinds of things physicists worked on when they had tenure. He also mentioned that a physicist’s task was to produce papers and that often meant putting aside work which delayed that task. I nodded my head and left his office, but it seems that I wasn’t satisfied because later I approached the issue tangentially. I asked him how one goes about coming up with and implementing project ideas as a graduate student. In response, Jesse was quick to admonish me. He said that getting a Ph.D in physics was much like an apprenticeship and the student’s job was to complete the projects his/her advisor assigned. I remember walking away less docile than before; I felt self righteous about his claim for I knew of so many historical examples (Feynman, C.N. Yang, de Broglie) where it did not apply. Surely, these physicists might have been exceptions to a rather firm rule but, Jesse had made his claim so categorically, that it seemed he did not believe these exceptions existed.

Moreover, and perhaps this was not explicitly Jesse’s, intention, it seems that he was telling me that I needed to take the route which was safe and assured because the alternative was too risky even given its potential for success. He was also in a sense encouraging me to place my faith in institutions and to believe that even if I was not completing work which was personally interesting now, these institutions will find sufficient value in the personally disaffecting work I did complete, to in the future give me the time and money needed to complete the work I wanted to. 

But really, how can anyone with an even rudimentary knowledge of American history, have anything other than distrust for, let alone faith in, the institutions which attempt throughout one’s life to give one definition. I would argue that the risk exists rather in the opposite direction. There is the risk of waiting so long to make your ideas a reality that they eventually leave you and take with them much of what defines your identity. 

(I recognize it is a privilege to say this, to claim that the risk which feels more threatening is the philosophically existential one rather than the economically existential one.)

Was there an unconscious cynicism in all this? It seems Jesse was encouraging me to complete my graduate study based on his own evaluation of what is risky and what is worthy of that risk. But in truth what I would be risking was my own life and the time which comprises it, so shouldn’t I have been making the evaluation of what was worthy the risk? 

To prove his point about the apprenticeship model of graduate school, Jesse told me a story about a classmate of his who he thought was one of the most creative physicists he had ever met. The student published about a dozen papers while in graduate school, but it seems he was too independent. He did not work closely with his advisor, and so he received a poor recommendation letter and either didn’t get a post-doc or received a bad one (I can’t remember). Jesse’s point was to reveal the importance of having and advisor with whom you worked closely, but I remember feeling ambivalent about whether this was the lesson to abstract from his story. 

I now know why. Faced with the theoretical decision of whether I would spend my Ph. D faithfully completing the work my advisor assigns and leaving with a solid recommendation, or doing something more independent and leaving without one, I believe I would choose the latter. Indeed, if this semester is any indication, I have already begun choosing the latter. Jesse’s example did illustrate something for me, as he intended, but it was the opposite point he was trying to make. He showed me that if I were to make this decision, I should be cognizant of the potential costs and not delude myself into believing my advisor, Harvard, or the proverbial world will acknowledge my efforts. 

This I suppose is good enough. One cannot have everything in the world, so decisions must be made and followed through on the basis of what one principally values; most other things must be relinquished, or, at least, compromised. In any case, reality must be confronted as it is even in pursuit of the realities yet to be realized.

In my head is a version of myself I believe I could be and who constantly reminds me of all the ways I am failing to be this person. Strangely, however, gone from my head are all the me’s which are this version’s antithesis. Gone are all the versions of me riddled with vices I have ultimately transcended and who thus could represent the fact that I can indeed become, if only partially, this idea of who I should be.

“The Transition to Independent Research: Who Makes It, Who Doesn’t and Why”
Undistinguished completers often do not work hard enough, and, at least in the sciences and social sciences, they have difficulty dealing with frustration, fear failure, have a low tolerance for ambiguity, and have difficulty delaying gratification. They may also lack or have lost their self-esteem or self-confidence. Undistinguished completers are often not intrinsically interested in their research project, in many cases because the topic or problem was given to them, and they may be more motivated by the idea of the PhD than by their research.
-Lovitts

Unfortunately, this can leave one in a double bind—a classic “catch 22” situation. As a doctoral student approaching what is probably his first major independent research work, one may find that in order to be “creative”, “original,” or “integrative” as his mentors expect, he will have to struggle into some realization of how his thought processes need to function if he is to be productive. Unfortunately, the rationalist acculturation runs deep in the academic community, and his mentors themselves may operate under misconceptions. The student may find himself locked into a process of self-discovery at a time when the pressures involved leave precious little time for experimentation. It out not to be surprising if he opts for a more conventional approach or even a safe topic, with a view to survival, rather than following a more innovative and original research questions.

Scientist as Individual
“Cultivating Creative Endeavor in Doctoral Research” Quotes and Discussion

Put most bluntly, one cannot separate the cultivation of scientific thought from the cultivation of mind and personhood, more broadly conceived…In this article we are trying to avoid viewing the “science” of the scientist as standing outside of the “selfhood” of the scientist…

To isolate one psychological function, in this case the rational, from all others is to limit the effectiveness of that function, diminish the quality of its products, and introduce imbalance into the psyche that is potentially disabling… 

Science can excite the mind best when the scientists is free to play with ideas and to create new forms that are intrinsically meaningful and “beautiful” to him; in other words, when he can engage in the creation of scientific thought and research that draws upon the depths of his experience, values, and commitments as a human being as well as upon his knowledge and skill…

This cannot happen when science is viewed solely as an enterprise in logic or when authority over ideas is vested in the “great scientists” and in an already extant body of knowledge. Perceiving authority in science as emanating from external sources may paralyze the psyche and rob it of the capacity for internal centering that allows energy to flow into integrative and ultimately creative activity. 


This is an incredibly interesting idea. It is one that Root-Bernstein mentioned in “How to Really Think Like a Scientist.” In that article Root-Bernstein stated that the history of science often inaccurately presents discoveries as obvious things which would have been seen by anyone in the right place at the right time. Rather, after giving examples of phenomena which were seen, but not discovered, by many scientists, he states that one would cannot help but find the markers of the scientist’s personality in what she discovers and the way she discovers it. 

Moreover, it seems the idea of science as a purely objective activity is not only inaccurate and stultifying but it is also self-stabilizing as those who are unable to make it through the process of becoming scientists are then depicted (by themselves and others) as simply lacking in ability or aptitude. In result there is no interrogation of the model by which scientists are developed. There is no sense that scientific work is a specifically value-oriented activity or that someone who fails to engage with the work, far from lacking the ability to do it, may in fact be having an allergic reaction to the values the work represents.

Of course I like this idea because it gives a self-gratifying explanation for why I was never motivated by Thaler’s or Amir’s projects. These projects reflected values and interests that I could not call my own. 

I would call this too simplistic of a framing, if it had not so repeatedly proved itself to be true. Even when I was back in New Orleans in 2014, I found my work being ground to a halt whenever I tried working on projects based on an externally determined perception of their value. The clearest case of this was a supersymmetric instanton project I tried to begin. I read the paper, and right when I tried to start working through the analytical aspects of the work, I became exhausted and frustrated and intellectually unwilling to engage with anything. It was nothing at all like procrastination; it was like I was running into a mental wall. I think it was because I was motivated to work on the project, not because of any merits I could see, but because I was chasing a value that others told me was there. 

But doesn’t much of education proceed in this way? With students learning and imbibing based on value systems very few could claim align with their own? 

Another Quote

Some useful questions that might be raised in this regard are:…Does it present itself as intrinsically meaningful and significant to him? Does it have the power to draw out and bring to flower his special abilities and unique insights?…Because of the objectivating influences of their academic and professional acculturation, students may find this difficult. They tend to view authority as being outside themselves; to look to their committee for signals as to what is an appropriate problem, and to seek “permission” to pursue a particular problem. If not tempered, these tendencies can prevent a student from accomplishing rewarding and significant work. 

Who are these authors and why do they think the graduate science student has any chance of proposing a project that he himself finds interesting let alone existentially fulfilling?

Meeting with David Morin

I met with David Morin today to discuss the problems I sent to him about a month ago. We talked about the relativistic rocket problem first and he mentioned my alternative assumption was an interesting one. Neither of us was exactly sure how physical it was to assume constant mass (as opposed to constant relativistic energy) for relativistic rocket motion. I still need to look into this.

Afterwards he discussed some of the subtleties concerning the inelastic collision and the relative velocity problems. Specifically, he wanted to know if there was a physical reason the energy lost to the system is independent of the internal spring constant. I couldn’t think of any reason divorced from a dimensional argument. He also mentioned that the relative velocity problem could probably be solved using energy (which perhaps should have been clear to me given that the final result had a square root). 

For the renormalization group problem, he mentioned that although the result was interestingly framed, an  introductory physics student (having not been exposed to the actual renormalization group) might miss the importance of the result. It would be more likely someone knowledgeable of high energy physics or condensed matter physics would better appreciate the result. 

In general, he stated that the problems were probably too difficult for Physics15a (the mechanics course for Physics concentrators at Harvard) but were probably appropriate for Physics 16 (the uber-difficult mechanics course for physics concentrators). For my own future reference, I asked him what distinguished course 16 students from course 15 students and he ambiguously said that both groups had the same background in physics (an AP level physics course), but the physics 16 students were just better at physics either because they were better at mathematics or had just absorbed more from their physics courses. 

He also mentioned that the mathematics for most of the problems was sufficiently difficult that the students would probably be overloaded by the math and consequently miss the larger conceptual points I’m trying to make. He suggested that if I really wanted to put the concepts in the foreground, I should use a set of mathematically more transparent problems (even if I think they’re extremely trivial) so that students aren’t distracted by the analytical work needed to understand the problem 

Finally, I asked him about my particular interpretation of the correct way to write E = Mc^2. (That given what we (currently) understand about how mass arises, it is more appropriate to write this equation as M = E/c^2). He said he agrees with me and that some other physicist some time ago went on a “tirade” in this direction. 

So. Cool Meeting. I’m not even going to mention (except here) how surreal it was that I got to meet David Morin.

“Development of the Mind” by Joseph Katz, from Scholars in the Making: The Development of Graduate and Professional Students ed. Katz and Hartnett

We have stressed the need of a knowledge base for invention, but the way that base is now established means the encouragement of passivity. So many dissertations and so much research are done out of duty—out of an enforced sense of what [to do] and how one should do it—rather than out of a lively curiosity. Many dissertations are poor and many others are never written because the problems that the students were inquiring into did not mean that much to them. They did not care that much to know. 

This passage reflects on the inextricable tie between the researcher’s work and his real (which some may label ‘intrinsic’) desire to do that work. The point the passage is making is somewhat obvious and would be clear to most people if they were willing to just pose the implicit question at is background, namely whether a person’s work improves when they actually have a non-externally imposed compulsion to do it. Raised in a system of education where objectives were set and accomplished with little regard for the desires/interests of the person completing them, I of course never asked myself whether caring about one’s work would affect the quality of it. I always assumed I would be able to produce good work regardless because I was relatively competent and diligent. My undergraduate thesis—which was “poor and almost not written”—was a clear (but interestingly not the first) example of how working on a problem that doesn’t mean much to you can result in really shitty work. 


…it is clear that many graduate students have had an unbroken experience of school authority from grade through graduate school. Schools, like many institutions, breed and reward obedience…Self-esteem is also interfered with from the just noted dependence on external approbation. Having been in school all one’s life can make one particularly prone to look for confirmation from the teacher rather than to have it come from one’s own sense of capacity and power to produce. Training programs may give lip service to the value of originality, while in fact expecting products that conform rather strictly to the specific canons of inquiry schools of thought, and the personalities of the people on the examining committee. 


How interesting! This is in line with what Jon Schmidt spoke about in Disciplined Minds. The system of graduate education exists in continuity with the system of undergraduate and secondary education both of which value obedience and scrupulous deference to authority. In order for the system to maintain itself (from the criticisms of those who fail to conform) this obedience must masquerade as self-driven discipline. Of course such a structure of education will largely determine the personalities and working styles of most of the students who enter graduate school. This leads me to ask if this is what graduate institutions want in their students? There are certainly incentives for the research professor (in terms of the work he can output) in having a large cohort of largely obedient students who are also very technically competent. In fact there is a large incentive for all of society in having such people. These people can effectively be utilized by those in power to achieve the desires of power, without the risk of having their authority or the way they are using that authority questioned.

Things to Remember
 
1. You don’t need to be able to do everything.
 
2. Learn from everyone
 
3. Only the internal space of work can beat back the void.
 
4. It is not about who’s against you or who’s for you. It’s about you and about what you want. Everything else is a distraction.
 
5. Look for patterns. Pay attention to Confusion.
 
6. What people think of you does not change who you are.
 
7. Have faith in your ability to improve.
 
8. Follow no one. Have no prophets and no idols.
 
9. Watch out for your ego. When it starts controlling your actions you’re messing up.   
 
10. Have faith that the knowledge you seek exists. Believe that the world is understandable. 

11. “Done” in reality is better than “good” in your head.

12. Don’t be arrogant


OR 

What you need for your work: Faith, Focus, Patience and a daily application of all three.

Meeting With Erel Levine

Comments on the Biology 
I met with Erel Levine yesterday to talk about the thermal permutations project. First, my motivations is mostly hogwash which is something that I really should have known. Talking to him revealed my notion of stability and the association of stability with energy is very hand wavy. I think this was because I wasn’t entirely clear whether I was interested in energetic stability or evolutionary stability, namely whether the compound’s configuration within the cell was stable or whether the compound performed a specific and consistent function which other compounds could not. 

One of Levine’s criticisms was that the energy of a DNA chain, for example, is not specifically dependent on the sequence of constituents but on the specific pairing of base groups. He did allow for the possibility that the sequences of amino acids for a resulting protein do in a way determine the resulting energy of the protein, but there is no restriction on the set of components which can occupy each lattice site. In other words the assumption of considering a space over permutations of a sequence is not really related to any situation in biology. 

He also mentioned the precise act of permuting two components in a sequence (unlike a spin flip which distinguished states in the Ising Model) is not related to any physical process in biology. I recognized this to a certain extent when I was trying to study the non-equilibrium problem, but I hoped it wasn’t a major flaw. It seems to be a problem though if I am to try to associate this model with some process in the world. 

Mores positively he mentioned that the ideas of my work, if not the specific results, might be relevant to self assembly problems that some physicists/biologists/chemists are currently working on. He interestingly mentioned Eugene Shakhnovich (who I’m meeting in two weeks) in this vein. 

Shaknovich’s work concerns how specific sequences lead to a protein which does or does not fold. Levine stated that Shaknovich is specifically interested in the zero temperature case where each state is bound or unbound but if you consider the low temperature case you can associate a boltzmann factor with each state. But here, the state space still refers to bound and unbound states and not the space of possible sequences. 

In short I was operating under the standard physicist hubris of entering an entirely new field of study and believing I could produce something sensible through the mathematics alone. To be fair the biological interpretation of the problem was mostly glammed on after I solved the mathematical problem itself, so it somewhat makes sense that a biological interpretation is not immediately transparent. I really was not paying attention to my own dictum that any physical investigation must begin and end with the physical situation. Namely, if your goal is to construct a physical model, you must first and foremost have fidelity to the physical situation even if you discover something mathematically interesting. 

But upon thinking about it, I think these ideas on sequences and energy, can be relevant to current attempts to understand self assembly. In self assembly (from what I understand) one puts necessary constituents into an environment which allows for their assembly into different structures. In this sense one is really limited to a space of permutations of particular sequences (because of course the only thing which can change among different structures is their order of components). Of course, it is not clear whether the energy I study in this case is at all relevant to the energy of these self assembly models but at least the underlying idea of the two has some resonance.

Comments on the Physics/Mathematics
Away from the biology, Levine commented that he believed this system had been studied before. For one he said that he felt that he had seen the ratio of partition functions leading to a diffusion equation in another context.  He called the technique I used to do this the diffusion approximation (which he told me is what he believed I called it, but really seems to be the intuition he abstracted from my discussion). I admittedly did not to a literature review of this problem (since it really just began as an exercise I was curious about), so I wasn’t sure if he was right. Shallowly, typing the words permutation and statistical mechanics lead to the standard results (the role of permutations in defining combinations which are in turn used to write a counting of states). So I think I would need to somehow perform a more incisive search to see if he is right. 

Other search terms
Partition Function Ratio
Diffusion Equation and Permutations
Derangements and Diffusion Equation

Somewhat confusingly he mentioned that he had seen this “diffusion approximation” in Yang-Mills theories in statistical mechanics. I had never seen such an interpretation anywhere in my study of yang-mills theories so I asked him for some references. He suggested a book by Gottfried and Amit (which I could not find) and a book by Reichl (which I did find). In the Reichl book I saw the Yang-Lee model of phase transitions had some of the concepts he was describing but I couldn’t see how these concepts were related to what I was doing. In another book by Amit, I saw no mention of the Yang-Lee model. I need to ask Levine if the book by Amit that I found is the correct one; If there is another book by Gottfried (besides the QM one) I should look for; and if he was referring to the Yang-Lee model. (I should also ask him about the lecture notes he said he had on this subject)

Encouragingly, he mentioned that even if this model had been studied before, it is sometimes/often useful to look at a known model in a new physical context, so I really should try to understand if this model is at all physically relevant. 

More abstractly he said that what I’m really looking at is the permutation group, which is a really basic example of a group used in group theory. He wasn’t sure if there had been work in this direction but he said it might be interesting to 1) see if there was work in this direction and 2) see if it’s possible at all to study the quantum field theory of the permutation group. The very phrasing of this seem pretty interesting so I definitely want to look into this. This episode seems to justify Root-Bernstein’s comment that there is a way of engaging in scientific work (through play and punning for example) which leads to interesting problems. 

Finally, he gave me some more macroscopic advice about working in physics in general. He said there have been many developments in physics in the past 100 years—which my insecurity led me to believe he was telling me the problem I was working on was somewhat basic—and that physics is in a “really really advanced state”. From the outside, he said, it’s difficult to tell what these physicists are doing and why their work is interesting or important, but if you spend six months working in the subject you can get a sense of why these things are interesting and be more motivated to work on them. His example was Majorana fermions in condensed matter physics which are apparently uninteresting from the outside but gain greater theoretical significance after some thorough engagement. He said that his own interest in statistical mechanics started low at the beginning of his Ph.D increased to a very high level in the middle/close to the end of his Ph. D and then went low again when he had obtained some concrete results and realized he didn’t really care about them. And then he switched to biology, which he said—with regard to the switching—was really quite OK to do. 

So I’m liable to believe Erel’s comment about how some consistent engagement with these new physics ideas can lead to a greater appreciation for them. Except, I spent much of my time as an undergraduate operating implicitly under this philosophy and finding that it didn’t at all fulfill it’s promise. I was virtually clueless about high energy physics when I was a freshman, and yet the time I spent learning supersysmmetry, supergravity,  r-axions, and hidden local symmetry did not develop in me a greater appreciation for the current work in BSM physics; indeed just the opposite happened. Might condensed matter physics be different? Possibly, but for now I’m going to try the other route of motivating my study by questions instead of subject. I definitely still want to learn condensed matter physics, but I don’t think I can continue to deny my experience in this direction. 

What was really useful was the reminder that there was a large body of work in physics—completed just as recently as in the last century—that I could be, but am not, drawing from or using to complement my investigations. I have made space for such work in my current working schedule (they’d be grouped under Learning modules), but I have been largely neglecting such learning for other projects. So it is clear I need to be more deliberate about this. At the risk of a token change, I will rename these modules, instead of simply “Learning Modules”, “Modules in Modern Physics” (to emphasize that I should be looking at recent work and not just very old work) and I will create a schedule for their completion. 

I think two weeks should be enough time to learn the motivation behind an idea, what questions the idea can answer, the techniques which underlie it, and to write up everything. But I rarely ever meet my scheduling constraints, so we will see how this goes. 

Lastly, Levine mentioned as a side comment to a context I can no longer recall that the mathematical argument was really quite elegant. Which surprised me because I never thought of my mathematical work as elegant. Maybe even if these physical ideas don’t pan out I can still publish the work in a journal of mathematical physics. 

Things to take away
The Physical System and Self Assembly: If you really want to apply this model to a biological system you need to understand the biological systems apart from the mathematics. I think self assembly is the most promising direction, so you should read some papers (and do a literature review) on self assembly. 
Yang-Lee’s Theory of Phase Transition: This theory apparently has similar mathematics to this problem. Add it to the modern physics modules. 
The QFT/SFT of the permutation group: is something which should be a set part of the canon of QFT. Levine states that the permutation group is one of the first you learn about in group theory, so it makes sense that one would try to study it with QFT. 
Read/Try to find Literature on Permutation Models: It’s really useful to just read the literature of a subject before you start working on problems within it. 
Create Modules of Modern Physics: This is to emphasize that you’re looking to find recently (circa 100 years) developed ideas in physics. 
Universality Class: Levine mentioned universality classes when he suggested I study this problem with QFT. What universality class does this model fall into? This means look into scaling, symmetry, and dimensions as well. 

For the paper, you can use this discussion to change the motivation in two directions. 
First, you should read about self assembly, and try to understand if there is any relevance to the model you consider. If there is you can write a motivation based on self assembly; In any case, you should write a motivation which is based on the mathematical physics of the problem alone. Perhaps look at Lieb’s papers to get a good sense of the possible motivations.

Liberation of the oppressed

Freire (1970) postulates that only the oppressed can liberate themselves and the oppressor(s) through acts of dialogue, restoration, and liberation. The teacher, who is in a positional power, is incapable of ‘giving’ the student power (Freire, 1970). Instead, learners must learn to exercise their own power in a productive way. In doing this, they stop asking for the approval of the system. Individuals become responsible scholars when they make their own claims about the validity and truth of their ideas and support them with independent and critical thinking. They are no longer in the mode of seeking approval; they step up to and own their responsibilities.
From “From scholarship student to responsible scholar: a transformative process” Patricia Canton and Lin Lin

I am looking for approval to no longer have people’s approval. Constantly asking/demanding the approval of authority figures limits your prospects to their previous work. 

The implicit question was whether I can still win the prizes of the game if I refused to play it. The question has an obvious answer when it is framed in this way but I hadn’t even concretely formulated the question so I still believed it was possible to play both sides.

Hi Professor Levine, 

Thank you for the meeting on Tuesday. I have a few questions about some of the things we discussed. 

1. You mentioned that what I wrote concerning the “diffusion approximation” has been shown in other statistical systems. I think you mentioned Yang Mills theory in this direction and books by Gottfried/Amit and Reichl which discussed it. I couldn’t find a book coauthored by Gottfried and Amit, but the book by Amit alone didn’t seem to mention anything relevant. The book by Reichl also didn’t mention Yang-Mills theories but she did mention the Yang-Lee theory of phase transitions. From the description of this theory I didn’t see exactly how any approximation she made was similar to the diffusion approximation, but I am probably misunderstanding it. 

You mentioned you had lecture notes on this calculation. Is there an online link to them?
Also, am I mistaken about the suggested authors and topic? What was the book by Gottfried and Amit you suggested? And was the topic on the Yang-Lee theory or Yang Mills theory

2. I think you also mentioned that this statistical mechanics (of permutations) problem had probably been solved before. You also mentioned that there should be some investigation of the quantum field theory/statistical field theory of the permutation group. I have looked for some references and I haven’t been able to find any in either direction. In particular, I don’t see how it would be possible to consider the QFT of the permutation group since most QFT are built around continuous rather than discrete symmetries. Again, maybe I’m misunderstanding something. 

- Was there a text/paper you were thinking of which discussed these ideas? All the statistical mechanics texts I’ve seen only discuss permutations in the context of fermion and bose systems. 

Best, Mobolaji


Hey PEL podcasters,

I started listening to your podcast this year and I've enjoyed hearing each of you guys' take on various 20th century philosophy ideas. I especially enjoyed your nuanced discussion of Kuhn

I have a podcast/discussion request: For a future episode could you guys could frame a discussion around Jeff Schmidt's book Disciplined Minds. In it he discusses the ways graduate/professional education is often antithetical to its professed aims, namely that it cultivate habits of procedural and rigid thinking and that (especially for graduate school) the educational model favors tractability and deference to existing hierarchies in its students. 

I'm not really doing the book justice with this description; it  can probably generally be categorized as philosophy of education, but Schmidt's arguments are quite concrete and grounded in stories and data, rather than merely a logical progression of ideas, and he ends with suggestions for reform. 

I hope you guys read the book and create a podcast around it. 

If one book isn't enough, you could combine it with certain sections of Noam Chomsky's Understanding Power (from "Ideological Control in the Humanities and Sciences" to "Fate of an Honest Intellectual"). I think Paulo Freire's "Pedagogy of the Oppressed" and bell hook's "Teaching to Transgress" would fit with the theme as well. 


Paragraph Notes on “How Scientists Really Think” Bernstein - May 30, 2016 
- A well thought out piece on how the standard conception of science (as a series of logical tasks framed around deduction and induction) does not reflect the focus of scientists (i.e., that they are primarily interested in questions rather than answers) and does not reflect the way scientists actually work. 

- The main point could be summarized as: Scientist use play, punning, and many other informal non-rigorous means to generate interesting questions and problems which can often lead to the interesting results or the discovery of interesting phenomena. After the object of interest is discovered, the scientist then goes through the more rigorous and more traditionally scientific steps of justifying and confirming the discovery. 

P2
- Can formal logic (deduction and induction) completely describe how scientists work?
	- Perhaps deduction and induction only applies to the testing and justification processes of science. If so this leads us to the question…
- Fundamental question: Is the context of discovery distinct from the context of testing and justification?

P3
- Neils Bohr: “progress in science follows most rapidly from paradox”

P4
- Induction: Reasoning from particular instances to general rules
	- More formal philosophical definition: When a set of statements likely but not absolutely implies another set of statements.  
- Deduction: Reasoning from general rules to particular instances
	- More formal philosophical definition: When a set of statements absolutely implies another set of statements. 
- Abduction: Hypothesizing conclusions
- These terms fail to model important and basic processes of scientific investigation
	- How does one acquire data?
	- How is dissent possible if conclusions follow logically from data and propositions?
	- What does one examine? Ignore?

P5 
- Worse still these terms don’t really address the task of problem creation.
	- This lack is important because all fruitful scientific research begins with a problem.
	- Bernstein defines a problem as a mismatch between theory and experiment. I think it is more accurate to see a problem as a gap in an epistemic network. 

- Quote: “Science starts neither with theory or data but with areas in which these are insufficient”
	- Bernstein is arguing that it is the very nature of this insufficiency which requires the scientist to move beyond the standard deductive/inductive conception of science and engage more flexibly with what constitutes problem solving

P6
- New hypotheses (and the questions which are their antecedents) arise from attempts to account for anomalies in existing theories. 

P7 
- Consider Alexander Fleming discovery of Lysozyme
- Many historians are puzzled by the genesis of his research; We’ll review
	- The standard accounts of the discovery 
	- [Root-Bernstein’s] Explanation of these standard accounts
	- The elements of this explanation which relate to the logic of discovery and the distinction between the antecedents of discovery and the process of justification. 

- The goal is to show that Fleming’s discovery is comprehensive if one includes fun, game playing, punning, and surprise into the discovery process.

P8 
- Lysozyme is an enzyme with antibacterial activity
	- Together with skin, lymphocytes, and antibodies, lysozyme is one of the bodies main defenses against infection. 

- No one had foreseen the possibility of something like lysozyme and some scientists believed the existing defenses against infection were sufficient and complete. 

- Thus, there were no set of anomalous observations or outstanding problems which could lead one to search for lysozyme

P9
- Since there was no direct reason to search for lysozyme, most accounts of its discovery rely on the idea that it stems from a chance event. 
	- A chance event is one for which no causal explanation is possible. 

- The standard idea is that Fleming was not looking for anything in particular and the discovery of lysozyme just “fell into his lap”.

P10
- Standard account by W.H. Hughes, Fleming’s assistant later in life. 
	- Fleming had broken his nose when he was a boy and subsequently suffered from recurrent colds
	- One winter while Fleming was examining a bacterial colony his nose dripped onto a culture plate. 
	- The colonies on the plate were contaminants, likely brought in by the air. 
	- The colonies splashed by the mucus “melted away” and Fleming sub-cultured the remaining ones onto a new plate. 

P11
- Additional details by V.D. Allison, Fleming’s assistant at the time of discovery in 1921
	- Fleming was busy cleaning two week old petri dishes when he inspected one dish and showed it to Allison.
	- The dish was covered in large yellow colonies except for a wide area where there were no organisms. 
	- Fleming explained that the dish was one to which he added his own mucus when he happened to have a cold. 
	- The idea occurred to Fleming that there must be something in the mucus which was killing off the organisms and he sought to study the problem more carefully. 
		- He undertook this more carful study first by Gram-staining the contaminant after which he discovered it was not a pathogen but a large gram-positive coccus bacteria

- There are apparent similarities in this account to the one of Fleming discovering Penicillin. 

P12
- Fleming was lucky that that particular contaminant entered his petri dishes
- Only a limited number of bacteria are sensitive to Lysozyme activity
- So it was important that the contaminant was that particular bacteria and not another


P13 
- This account has the concurrence of four totally random events
	1. Fleming gets a severe cold
	2. He accidentally contaminates a dish created for another purpose and he doesn’t throw it away. 
	3. The contaminating bacteria is one that is particularly sensitive to lysozome
	4. His nose drips onto the plate accidentally and he observes the dissolution of bacterial quantities

- Account also seems to clearly illustrate the irrationality of the discovery process
	Important Quote: “The existence of bacteriolysing activity displayed by Fleming’s mucus had not been predicted by anyone and probably could not have been.”
	- No Induction: there were no general laws derived from data
	- No deduction: there was no prediction from a general rule because there was o general rule
	- No hypothesizing (prior to the discovery) since the dripping and its later recognition were both the result of chance. 

P14 
- However, the mere observation of an anomaly is not at all sufficient to term something a discovery. 
	- The “discovery” must be interpreted, confirmed, and then added into the exiting body of knowledge ever before it could be termed a discovery. 

- On the day when Fleming “discovered” lysozyme, the best he could tell his colleagues would have been some stuff from his nose dissolved an unknown bacterium he had never seen before. 

- What one should say about this chance account is that it shows how Fleming discovered, not lysozyme, but the problem which leads to lysozyme. 

P15
- Considering this a chance account is inconsistent with Fleming’s apparent motivations. 
- Fleming told Allision that the result was interesting, but something could only be interesting in relation to expectations. 
	- What were Fleming’s expectations?
- An observation is only testable in a logical sense with regard to some explanatory framework. 
	- What was Fleming’s framework?

P16
- In these ways the irrationalist explanation proves to be inadequate, and the separation between context of discovery and context of justification is revealed to be artificial. 
	- Fleming’s strange observation had no scientific meaning at his moment of observation. “He saw something he had never seen before: We all do everyday. So what?”

	- And yet he devotes a large portion of his time to studying this observation. 

	- Why did it have meaning to him?  Why was it interesting? To understand these things we need to understand how Fleming thought.

P17
- We’ll start again and look at Fleming’s work while considering his personal characteristics as a context

- One of the base flaws of the logic oriented accounts of discovering is a hidden assumption that anyone in the same position as the discoverer would have seen the same thing and drawn the same conclusion. 

P18
- Seeing is not perceiving and without perception there is no discovery. 

- Although Roentgen is cited as discovering X-rays in 1895, at least five scientists observed the same phenomena Roentgen did and they did so before him. 
	- Yet only Roentgen perceived the importance of the scintillations and photographic plate foggings that led to the discovery of X-rays. 


- Observation is theory directed and theory dependent
	- Every individual has a different set of theories and a different personality and will therefore apply what they know and perceive what they see in different ways. 


P19
- Personality: The sum of interests, skills hobbies, experiences, and desires that define a scientist as a human being. 

- The scientist’s personality will be reflected and apparent in the theory he or she invents

- Fleming as a person: what unusual styles of thinking did he bring to his research? How did these help him solve the problem that led to lysozyme?

P20
- Fleming had a playful personality. 
	- He played poker, bridge, ping-pong, and quiz games 
	- He was also, like Feynman, a practical joker. 

P21
- He would try almost anything and not take it too seriously. 
	- He was the only non-artist member of the Chelsea arts club
- The same philosophy guided his research. 
	- Fleming’s quote: “I play with microbes…it’s pleasant to break the rules.”

P22
- Fleming would also take micro organisms that developed colors, “paint” them on a petri plate, and then incubate it. He was able to create sophisticated images this way (ballerina, union jack, etc.)

- These games required highly developed bacteriological skills.

P23
- Because he played with Germ paintings, he had an unusually wide knowledge of bacterial properties. 
	- We was constantly on the lookout for bacteria with strange properties. 

- According to his colleagues, he had a habit of leaping onto anything that was different. 

- He cultivated the unexpected by keeping cultures for two or three weeks at a time just to see if anything interesting happened. 

P24
- Max Delbruck’s “Principle of Limited Sloppiness” 
	- Be sloppy enough that something unexpected happens, but not so sloppy that you 	cannot tell what happened. 


	- It seems that the general approach was to liberate yourself from an existing epistemic framework and to make contact with new phenomena and the questions which lead to their elucidation by thrusting yourself into the unknown where such things reside, namely, by asking question you had not idea the answer to. 

	- This is similar to your idea that a project only needed to be “new”. But you can now be more concrete:
		- A project should be something you A priori do not know the answer to. 
		- “What if” questions are excellent in this regard. 

- These scientists were able to raise problems by intentionally breaking the rules of controlled experimentation. 

- They worked on their science in a non-instrumental way which allowed for the possibility of play. 

- We note as well: systematic rule breaking as an experimental method for generating
problems is still very much a rational means of investigation. 


P25
- Fleming used his germ paintings to cultivate the unexpected in three ways
1) Light hearted investigation: through play
2) Sophisticated Knowledge and Skills: by developing his bacteriological knowledge and finely tuned ability to recognize the unexpected. 
3) Combinations: Encouraging unexpected bacterial interactions and contaminations. 

Also he had an ability to effectively (graphically, beautifully, simply) arrange phenomena. 

P26
- In Fleming’s work, he often imagined himself as various parts of the problem he wanted to solve. 

- To solve the problem of the failure of antiseptics to work on shrapnel wounds and compound fractures, he imagined what it would be like to be inside the wound himself. 

- Similar strategies were utilized by other scientists. 
	- Einstein imagining himself on a light beam. 
	- Peter Debye imagining himself as carbon compounds
	- Joshua Lederberg and Barbara McClintock imagined they were genes. 

- Each scientist had so internalized the rules of their discipline that they cold construct toy worlds which extended from these rules. Such toy worlds then served as a platform for constructing new rules. 

P27 
- Towards a solution of this problem, Fleming invented the spiky test tube. 
	- To this spiky test test tube he added bacteria and he also added bacterial to a regular test tube as a control
	- He then added antiseptics to each. 
	- He ultimately found that no amount of antiseptic could kill off the bacteria in the spiky test tube; the bacterial were able to wall themselves off in the ends of the spikes and survive. 

P28 
- The main things which underly these graphic displays are
1) Abstracting: The elimination of everything specific to individual cases to leave only a single general property
2) Modeling: The imitation of one thing by another; involves simplification of a complex situation. 
- Note that most modeling requires abstracting. 
- Abstracting and modeling (like problem generation through rule breaking) cannot be encompassed within the standard deduction, induction, abduction framing of science


P29 
- So Fleming, the game player, was actively looking for unusual bacteria especially for ones like the unknown coccus he found. 
- He knew what properties to expect from such a bacterium
- BUT did he accidentally drip nasal mucus onto the petri dish?

P30 + P31
- From a referenced paper it is apparent that the dripping was done on purpose “nasal secretion of this patient was cultivated daily on blood agar plates…”
- The patient was Fleming himself
	- But if he dripped on purpose, what was that purpose?

P32 
- First, we note that Fleming did not isolate his lysozyme-sensitive bacterium by accident. He was looking for it. 
	- On previous days he found common pathogens which did not interest him, and kept looking for new ones until he found one that did. 
- What were his criteria?

P34+P35+P36
- Fleming was actually looking for bacteriophages: a virus that “eats” bacteria.
- Why?
	- Filterable infectious particles that destroyed bacteria were first discovered in 1915 in the diarrhea of locusts. 
	- About a year later another bacteria-hating agent was discovered in the stools of patients with dysentery
	- Conclusion: all forms of the bacteriophage were associated with “the runs”

- Fleming’s problem: What if the infectious agent that causes runny noses is the same agent that causes runny bottoms? 

P37
- Could this really have been his starting point?
- Arthur Koestler: the structure of discovery was similar to the structure of jokes. 
- Peter Caws and Errol Harris: scientific reasoning will turn out to be merely a form of everyday reasoning. 
- Diderot in Dream of d’Alembert: “ideas awaken each other and they do so because they have always been related.”
- Michael Wilson and Thomas Hughes: scientists and inventor are characterized by an intense, almost poetical awareness of words and their meanings, of metaphor and analogy.

P38
Fleming is not alone in generating scientific hypotheses through verbal punning or recognition of similar terminology
	- Arrhenius invented the concept of ionic dissociation through a similarity in language

P39
- Bernstein’s conclusion: The runny-bottom-runny-nose hypothesis is the only one that can explain Fleming’s behavior. 
	- By looking for a bacteriophage, Fleming preset his mind to look for particular kinds of activity. 
		- one needs to isolate a particular bacterium, and then also isolate an agent capable of “eating it”
		- In the classic experiments: one grows bacteria in solution until the solution is cloudy; then one adds material thought to contain the bacteriophage and waits for the solution to become clear (representing the bacteriophages completely lysing bacteria)


	- Fleming performed this procedure on his bacterium and as he expected, the solution became clear. 
	- The next month he worked to characterize this new “bacteriophage” by performing many of the then standard techniques
		- filtering it, heating it, determining its susceptibility to chemical degradation and so on

P40
- This was when things started to go wrong
- First, it became clear that this “bacteriophage” did not replicate
	- When a solution of it was diluted, instead of returning to its original concentration, the solution stayed diluted. 

- Fleming soon realized he had an enzyme and didn’t discuss his motivations. 

P41
- There are two points to stress here
	
	- First Point: When making the analogy between colds and diarrhea, Fleming imports wholesale the entire set of techniques, tests, and criteria already developed for bacteriophage studies into this new realm; He thinks he is extending an existing corpus of science to embrace a wider field of phenomena

- The logic of research (which includes the logic of discovery) is identical and inseparable from the logic of verification. 
- The test of one idea becomes the discovery of something else and the initial hypothesis is neither verified nor falsified. 
- Scientific discovery cannot be divided from scientific justification: there is a logic to research that leads to the surprise of discovery through the recognition of unexpected problems generated by the research itself. 

P42
	- Second Point: All “chance discoveries” seem to be due to testing incorrect hypotheses generated by an extension of existing observations. In each case a preexisting expectation was not fulfilled, and the anomalous result required rethinking of that expectation.
		- Feynman’s “discovery” of Path Integrals is a good example of this; He was trying to develop a new particle based interpretation of quantum field theory and ended up developing a fundamental tool for quantum field theory itself. 

	- So there is no reason to separate the context of discovery from the context of justification: they are one and the same. 
		- The best scientists specifically utilize strategies designed to maximize their probability of encountering problems. 

P43
- Suggests ways for how we should change our view of science. 
- Working scientists spend the majority of their time, raising problems instead of solving them. 
- So instead of viewing science as a “Search for Solutions” it should be seen as a “Quest for Questions”
- Einstein’s quote
	- “The formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution, which may be a matter of mathematical or experimental skill. To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and works real advance in science.” In The Evolution of Physics

- It is not science’s ability to reach solutions that needs to be accounted for, but its ability to define solvable problems. 

P44
- Also, induction, deduction, and abduction are not sufficient to solve the range of problems scientists address
	- Scientific tools of thought have been developed not only to reason, but also to invent. 
	- Tools of invetion:
		- Abstracting
		- Modeling
		- Analogizing
		- Pattern Forming and Recognition
		- Visual Thinking
		- Aesthetics
		- Playacting
		- Manipulative Skill

P45
- Third, scientists employ strategies of research aimed at increasing their probability of discovering. 
	- Fleming invented bacterial paintings, had a tendency to break rules to see what 	happened. 

P46
- Finally, we must acknowledge that science is done by individuals each of whom possesses a different style of research and each of whom is heir to different traditions of research. 

- Implies that a logical analysis of science must recognize the variability of that process and how the scientists personality affects his or her style of work. 

P47
- Summary: 
	“Scientists do not only work using the traditional forms of logical analysis. A new kind of analysis is needed to account for problem invention, playfulness, punning, unexpected surprises, modeling, and analogizing. A more subjective view of the scientific process is needed.”


From Nothing to Something


Noticing and Identifying in Theoretical Physics 
- Both in properly categorizing new information and in noticing what questions can and should be asked

May 31, 2016 - Tuesday 10:22 AM
Developing New Problems 

In “How Scientists Really Think” Bernstein uses Alexander Fleming as an example of how a scientist’s way of working can lead him to discover new problems and hence new phenomena. Bernstein characterizes Fleming as a playful scientist who painted in his spare time and like creating games centered around what may be more formally called research. To characterize Fleming’s working style, Bernstein quotes Max Delbruck’s “principle of limited sloppiness”: Be sloppy enough so that something unexpected happens, but not so sloppy that you cannot tell what happened. However, Fleming was still a rigorous scientist and although the impetus for his more playful investigations may not have been firmly grounded in any contemporaneous theory, his pursuit and concretization of what he found surely was. 

The lesson which is apparent in Fleming’s story was not simply that his working style was one particularly attuned to making discoveries, but that it was one attuned to developing the inevitably precursor of a discovery: an interesting problem. By playfully combining elements of the existing science in novel ways, he was finding new phenomena and being led into new territories the subject had not previously explored. With these new territories new questions naturally arose which in turn sometimes led to what we more simply call a discovery.

As a way of developing new projects, I previously mentioned that at the start of an investigation you only need a new question, something about a subject which has not been asked before. In the process of trying to answer this new question, you may discover something interesting about the subject and be led to an investigation which although not specifically tied to the new question is still interesting in of itself. This explanation/recommendation/ seems consistent with Bernstein’s account of how Fleming developed his problems, but it is useful to be more explicit about this. 

Specifically, it should be clear that the first question you ask is not necessarily the question which will eventually be framing your investigation. This is because this first question is framed when you are considering a subject from the outside, and thus is limited by your ignorance of the subject. But this question leads you deeper into the subject and provides a new angle for a possible investigation. It is this new angle which leads to the more informed (and hence more useful) questions which are the foundation of any so called “good” problem.

Familiarity as a Precursor to Understanding

I am eventually going to write a full essay on the role familiarity with an idea or subject plays (or doesn’t play) in our eventual deeper understanding of the idea. But first in that direction, 

It seems that being familiar with an idea or mathematical formalism reduces the cognitive load one experiences when attempting to engage with it more deeply. This reduced cognitive load allows one to look beyond the surface level elements (e.g., the symbolic representation of the idea or formalism) and in turn allows more cognitive space to be devoted on the more substantial elements which lead to what we typically connote understanding. 

By being familiar with an idea, I mean engaging with the idea on the most superficial level possible: that of simple recall and recognition, knowing what other people state an idea is and the way it is typically described. For new subjects, you can begin by simply writing down the key terms and you can create a concept map, not based on any deeper understanding you’ve developed of the subject but based on a sort of standard understanding of it. This regurgitated knowledge then allows for something deeper later on. 

My main argument is that things like Meijer G-functions, Real-Analysis, machine learning, and virtually every new technical subject you try to learn are often couched in a language which is foreboding and unfamiliar. This unfamiliarity acts as a barrier to even beginning the process of building understanding. Thus to get beyond this barrier often involves immersing yourself or existing within a subject for long enough that the previously unfamiliar and personally threatening elements are now familiar and can be analyzed and questioned in a way which is more representative of deeper understanding. 


For the Essay
Familiarity and Understanding

Our intuitions and what we think of as understanding are often grounded in familiarity, but what we scientifically consider to be understanding is not based on familiarity. 

In our scholastic lives, although familiarity is not equivalent to understanding, it often serves as the first step which leads to the development of future understanding. 


———
Leftovers

By familiarity I mean it on the simplest and least informative level possible. namely that of simple recall. Simply recognizing at the most superficial level what other people state an idea is and the way they describe it. 

For truly new subjects, you begin by simply writing down the key terms. You can even create a concept map which relates them according to an author’s or many author’s conception of the subject. 


 understand and thus allows one to look beyond the superficial and distracting elements which point towards complexity (e.g., the symbolic representation of the idea) toward its more substantial and fundamental characteristics. 


June 4, 2016 - Saturday 2:41 AM
There is an unmistakable sense of "the structure of physics" which seems to distinguish it as a subject and a discipline from the many other subjects which one encounters in school. 

It is not quite mathematics because it does content with a concrete and tactile physical world. But it is also not quite divorced from mathematics as are the systems which comprise/define mathematical modeling as the mathematics which is used in physics seems to imply a constitutive mathematical nature to reality. We don’t say the geometry of spacetime is modeled by a two-tensor we call the metric, but that the metric is spacetime. Newton’s second law cannot merely be represented as a second order differential equation; this second order differential equation is the most precise and accurate way to state Newton’s second law. 

Physics is an interesting discipline because of the way it employs mathematics to understand (elucidate our understanding of) physical systems and the way many of its concepts are connected through theoretical logic. 

There is an authoritarian bent which is fundamental in any system of education but that bent is relaxed in physics because it is largely antithetical to the structure of physics itself. The truths/results of physics are true and should be taken as such not specifically because they are communicated to one by an authority figure but because they are logically consistent and are confirmed by our observations. This latter standard is often difficult to simulate/approach/register/reach in the classroom, but the former is well within our grasps. In other words physics has a structure which allows you the student to develop an understanding of it without relying completely/indiscriminately/uncritically on what a teacher tells you. We discuss this structure here and discuss what it implies about how physics can be learned. 

Our goal is to provide some sense of the logic and ideas which undergird physics and how the basic structure of physics naturally suggests the most efficient ways to study it. 

The structure of physics is one that allows the student (if she has the necessary technical background, is able to ask the right questions, and knows what assumptions to make) to develop much of theoretical underpinnings without recourse to any established authority. We discuss this structure here and discuss what it implies about how physics can be learned.

There is an authoritarian bent which is fundamental in any system of education where those more experienced in a discipline, communicate to the less experienced what to learn and how to build on what one learns. But this bent is forcibly relaxed in physics because it is largely antithetical to the structure of physics itself. The theoretical results in physics are taken as valid not specifically because they are communicated and accepted by authority figures, but because—in addition to being confirmed by our observations, as is true in all scientific fields—they are logically and specifically mathematically consistent. It is the mathematical consistency of these theories which largely defines what I call the ``structure of physics” and it is this structure that allows the student^{footnote (if she has the necessary technical background, is able to ask the right questions, and knows what assumptions to make ) to develop much of theoretical underpinnings without recourse to any established authority. In these notes we discuss this structure and what it implies about how physics can/should be learned. 

We discuss this structure here and discuss what it implies about how physics can be learned.


 It’s not always possible to experimentally verify physical predictions in the classroom, but the investigating consistency is much easier.

The Impossibility of an Apolitical Education

Sometime ago I read something by Noam Chomsky in which he argued that no one can truly be apolitical.  The crux of his argument was that a lack of a political affiliation or political intent reflects an implicit agreement with the existing political order. Those who are apolitical are by definition so undisturbed by the current structure and laws of their society that they feel no compulsion to change them, and without this compulsions for change, these supposedly apolitical beings exist and operate passively within the current regimes of the society and through their tacit acceptance of these regimes—due simply to their refusal to challenge them—they are complicit in their maintenance. 

The analogy which comes to mind is that of a burning house. The house has many dozen floors and currently only the bottom floor is on fire. But the fire is growing and little by little creeping up the building. You are currently fine because you live on the 20th floor, but there are people who are not fine and throughout the building there are arguments about what to do about the fire. On one side of a “political” divide, people argue we all need to find a way to put out the fire immediately; on the other side people question the existence of the fire and say that if it exists those on the lower floors should just move to higher floors. You, not wanting to enter into the debate, claim you’re “apolitical” and are not taking any side. But by advocating nothing, you are in fact, through your silence, advocating for the personal inaction which automatically aligns you with the side which feels no need to put out the fire. 

All this is to argue that because society cannot help but be politically constructed, any action in our society, especially actions which take place in large institutions like those which comprise higher education, is inevitably political; the action can be either implicitly political through its decision to not acknowledge (and hence its complicity with) the limitations of the existing order or explicitly political through its advocation of a specific position. bell hooks puts forward this position in Teaching to Transgress

	Again and again, it was necessary to remind everyone that no education is politically neutral. Emphasizing that a white male professor in an English department who teaches only work by ‘great white men’ is making a political decision, we had to work consistently against and through the overwhelming will on the part of folks to deny the politics of racism, sexism, heterosexism, and so forth that inform how and what we teach.

I am introducing this argument because I am composing some physics course notes and as I am trying to discuss the general structure of physics I seem to not be able to avoid some elements/discussions which some may argue are not appropriate to physics “proper” because they are politically tinged. In one paper/note I’m beginning with a quote by Noam Chomsky (or Doris Lessing) to illustrate a point about mathematical derivations. For the subsequent discussion in the paper, the exact subject matter of the quote is not crucial, and yet I am intentionally choosing a quote which refers explicitly to the thesis of the discussion—that education begins as a process of indoctrination and that in order to actually educate yourself for the future and the world you have to interrogate the standard means of indoctrination. 

I actually think I do a good job of “showing” rather than “telling” this idea and I really do not at all discuss the political implications of this position, but given the quote and the meat of the discussion they feel somewhat unmistakable to my admittedly conditioned eyes. 

What makes me insecure is how I may justify such subliminal political messaging to Jacob, but perhaps I can use my personal experience in this regard. I know one of the things I loved about Junot Díaz’s class was that he was the first teacher to acknowledge something wrong or false about the way students at MIT were educated. He recognized we were given a shit ton of work and he often mentioned how such a workload could have deleterious psychological and philosophical effects. Specifically, he stated that students became extremely stressed out and mentally ill and ended up conflating their value in the world with how much work they can produce. Now, this is not a political message given our current vernacular of what is political, but it is unquestionably tangential to the subject matter of Advanced Fiction Writing. And yet I loved it. It was something I hungered for throughout the entirety of my education: one of these authority figures calling out the system which bestowed upon them the very authority which they were asking us to question.

And so I feel compelled in a way to follow Junot’s example and provide the same lesson for my students. Of course one could say I am just falling into the standard teacher habit of teaching students the way one was taught but my defense is that I have had many many teachers and none of them had said anything remotely close to what Junot has said and Junot is the only one I want to emulate.

*It is important to acknowledge complicity not for the narcissistic purpose of making a moral judgment but for the more useful recognition of agency. Once we recognize that passive complicity to corrupt systems/institutions is largely what perpetuates their existence, we also recognize that destroying/removing/doing away with these institutions is within our collective reach. 

* This example is perhaps too easy because it naturally paints one side as the villain who ignores the fire, but it’s possible to imagine a dichotomy in which both sides are complicit in this ignorance: one side advocates for ignoring the fire and building stairwells to the higher floors and the other side also advocates for ignoring the fire but believes building elevators is the solution. Choosing between the two sides would represent a false choice because both are ultimately advocating for superficial distinctions of the same position, and complicity in ignoring the fire would still exist in choosing no side as surely it would exist in choosing one.

Sometime ago I read an argument by Noam Chomsky, that regardless of what a person says there is no one who can truly be apolitical. His main point was that a claim of apoliticality implies 	

A refusal to talk about politics reflects an implicit agreement (for whatever reason) with the status quo and hence this refusal is indistinguishable with complicity with the powers who hope that status quo is maintained. 

The crux of his argument was that to claim to lack a political affiliation reflects an implicit agreement with the status quo because those without political affiliations are by definition so undisturbed by the existing political order that they feel no compulsion to change it. Consequently, they act and exist in a society within the structures and laws which currently exist and thus are complicit in maintaining (through tacit acceptance of it) the existing political order.

Meeting with Eugene Shaknovich

I just had a very productive meeting with Eugene Shaknovich. I described my model and results to him and he provided some useful commentary and suggested directions for future work. First throughout my discussion he was constantly anticipating my next steps and the conclusions I was getting from my results. In one case, I was trying to compute the simplest partition function for this system, and I had just written down the partition function in the basis of vector states and I had only mentioned that I was going to change bases to simplify the result and he stated “Right, you’ll write it in terms of the number of incorrect components,” which was exactly correct and was an insight it took me a week to arrive at. Later I drew the phase space diagram for this system and from the free energies he mentioned that the system exhibited a second order phase transition ever before I drew the <j> vs T plot. He even immediately recognized the import of considering the mean field problem before considering the interacting case. I’d like to believe it was my fantastic presenting skills which allowed him to anticipate much of my discussion but of course I realize something else was going on. For all my talk of the arguable irrelevance of intelligence in most matters of work, here I was in the presence of someone whose intelligence, and its clear relevance, could not be denied. 

He confirmed partly my suspicion that the model was in its general outlines related to problems in protein folding. He gave me some references to explore in this direction and he suggested ways I should modify the model so that it was more physically relevant. He also lightly mentioned that I should be able to find a closed form expression for the simplest analytic (and non-interacting) case. 

One main contention was that I assume no multiplicity for my values of \omega. That is I assume \omega_k occurs once for each $k$. This is not the case in models of proteins. In models of proteins $k$ can run from 1 to 20 (for the twenty possible amino acids) and in any protein you can have multiple copies of the same amino acid. So I wound need to consider a more general problem in this regard. Namely,

Consider the problem where there are $n_k$ values of $\omega_k$ in the lattice. 

From his initial thoughts of this problem, Shaknovich imagined it would only require changing some combinatorial factors in g_N(j), but I couldn’t exactly mirror his vision of the problem, so I would need to work through it more carefully. 

Another problem he suggested is that I consider the case where there are only two types of proteins (hydrophobic and hydrophyllic) and look at permutations under this constraint. Specifically, we only have $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ but we have many different lattice sites. Professor Shaknovich mentioned that this problem was considered from the perspective of the ising model, but no one ever considered a permutation standpoint. 

	Consider the problem where there are only two possible values of $\omega_k$ but many different lattice sites and again a specific ordering with a lowest energy. 

Finally he said that if this model were to be truly physical, we would need to consider non-constant interactions among lattice sites. This means my mean field theory results are not precisely applicable, but they do possibly serve as a good first pass at understanding this system. I mentioned looking at Ising like interactions first and he said this was a good idea. He also said I should look at quenched randomness for the system. For this latter point I stated that it was something I had considered, but that I didn’t see the physical relevance of the question. He said that the relevance existed in considering a typical protein. I still don’t completely understand how this makes quenched disorder relevant, but I can guess that the space of all proteins exhibit a range of interaction values and that considering a typical protein would be like considering an average over all of these values. j

Consider Ising like interactions between lattice sites. 

Consider quenched random mu_ij between lattice sites to look at a typical protein

So I have my marching orders. These last two tasks were things I had wanted to do anyway, but it’s good to now have some additional ways to make the system more physically relevant. In all a good meeting.

Notes on Quantum Theory and Schrödinger

First some background:

We will outline Schrödinger’s path to the Schrödinger equation to illustrate how in real problem solving an investigator moves from a state of relatively great ambiguity to a state of great concreteness, at which latter point he may solve problems of the type typically practiced in a physics class. Before we discuss Schrödinger, we summarize part of the historical context which framed his work. 


First we discuss the historical context which frames/led the Schrodinger’s work. 


In 1900 Max Planck, in an attempt to explain the spectrum of frequencies produced by a perfectly emitting heated body (i.e., a ``black body”), posited that the energy E of light emitted at each frequency \nu was quantized in amounts given by

E = h \nu.

In 1900 in an attempt to explain the spectrum of frequencies emitted by a perfectly emitting heated body (i.e., a blackbody), Max Planck posited (with little motivation other than a frustration to establish the viability of alternatives) that the energy E of light emitted at each frequency \nu was quantized in amounts given by 

In his recollections of this work, Planck stated that he had little other motivation to introduce this idea other than his frustration to establish the viability of alternatives. And yet, from this postulate, he was able to derive the famous blackbody radiation formula 


for the density spectrum of light emitted from a black body. However, because his postulate of energy quantization was introduced more so out of pressing need to find semblance with experimental results than out of any deep physical insight, Planck was reluctant to interpret physically the implications of his formalism. 

But because, this idea was not physically motivated. 


From this postulate, Planck was able to derive his famous black body radiation formula for the density spectrum of light emitted from a black body. But although he introduced the postulate of energy quantization, he did so more out of pressing need to find semblance with experimental results and less so out of deep understanding, and thus he was reluctant to physically interpret the implication of his correct formalism. 

Interpretation and understanding came later in 1905 through Einstein’s work on the photoelectric effect. Attempting to explain why electrons are ejected from a metal when light shines on it, Einstein fully committed to Planck’s discrete energy postulate (Eq.,,) and further postulated that the energy of light came in discrete quantities because in the quantum realm light (termed ``photons”) had particle-like properties.

Nearly, twenty years later, a Ph. D student named Louis de Broglie published his dissertation where he argued the converse of Einstein’s photoelectric effect postulate. Namely, taking Einstein’s work on photons and the newly developed theory of special relativity (Citation), de Broglie argued that similar to the way electromagnetic waves can have particle-like properties, particles can have wave-like properties. Specifically, he established that a quantum particle of a certain momentum p carried with it a wave with wavelength \lambda given by 

\lambda = h/p 

where he used Einstein’s ideas explanation of photons and special relativity to argue that similar to the way electromagnetic waves can have particle like properties, particles can have wave like properties. Specifically, he established that a quantum particle of a certain momentum p carried with it a wave of wavelength

\lambda = h/p 

quantum particles could be defined not only in terms of particle-like quantities such as momentum but also wave-like quantities like wavelength. In particular, he established the relation between wavelength and momentum to be 

\lambda = h/p


This was the state of affairs, when in November of 1925, Peter Debye urged Schrödinger to review de Broglie's recently published thesis in a biweekly research seminar. 

To prepare for the review, Schrödinger worked through Debye’s thesis and sent letters to Einstein and other physicists expressing his awe of the work and his desire to obtain a better sense of what it really meant to consider a quantum particle as a wave. In a letter to Alfred Landé, Schrödinger writes 

\begin{quote}
I have been intensely concerned these days with Louis de Broglie's ingenious theory. It is extraordinarily exciting, but still has some very grave difficulties. I have tried in vain to make for myself a picture of the phase wave of the electron in the Kepler orbit. Closely neighboring Kepler ellipses are considered as rays. This, however, gives horrible `caustics' or the like for the wave fronts.
\end{quote}

In this correspondence, we see Schrödinger recognizing the conceptual potency of de Broglie’s results while simultaneously struggling with an inability to understand and hence fully utilize that potency. 

Later, in the seminar where Schrödinger presented de Broglie’s wave-particle thesis, Debye mentioned that such a discussion was interesting but woefully imprecise. In his opinion, any system that truly had wave-like properties should also have a wave equation. 

Thus Schrödinger’s task was set: Find a wave equation for the electron. Weeks later he used the energy-momentum relation from special relativity to obtain the time independent Klein Gordon equation.

(KG Equation with arbitrary potential)

After he obtained the KG equation, Schrödinger made his problem well-defined by setting $V = -e^2/r$ for the potential energy of the hydrogen atom and computing $E$, the associated energies. But he found that this associated energy spectrum did not match the observed spectrum, and so he abandoned this formalism and began looking for another. Over the following Christmas vacation, Schrödinger reformulated his approach and obtained what we now call the time-independent Schrödinger equation. He applied the equation to hydrogen atom and found that it produced the correct spectrum. 

(Sch Equation and Energy Spectrum)

In Schrödinger’s experiences we have an accurate/reliable depiction of the true problem solving process. There is first the recognition of a gap in knowledge (Schrödinger’s tentative search for a more concrete representation of de Broglie’s and Debye’s suggestion that precisely describing the wave-particle duality necessitated a wave equation); an imposition of a problem framework to address that gap (Schrödinger’s development of the Klein-Gordon equation for the hydrogen atom); a solution of that framework (his calculation of the hydrogen atom spectrum according to the KG equation which incorrectly predicted known results); and when that solution was found to be inadequate, a repetition of the process from the problem framework stage (Schrödinger's development of a non-relativistic version of the wave equation and his later application to the hydrogen atom to obtain the correct spectrum).


In Schrödinger's experiences we see the main hallmarks of the true problem solving process. There was first the recognition of a gap in knowledge (Schrödinger's tentative search for a more concrete picture of de Broglie's ideas and Debye's suggestion that a wave equation is necessary to precisely describe wave-particle duality); an imposition of a problem framework to address that gap (Schrödinger's development of the Klein-Gordon equation for the hydrogen atom); a solution of that framework (Schrödinger's calculation of Klein-Gordon hydrogen atom spectrum which incorrectly predicted the known results); and when that solution was found to be inadequate, a repetition of the process from the problem framework stage (Schrödinger's development of a non-relativistic version of the wave equation and his later application to the hydrogen atom to obtain the correct spectrum).

*I really can’t resist mentioning this. Apparently the Schrödinger Equation was developed before Schrödinger! It was developed by the American physicist named Alfred Lunn but rejected during the review process in a journal because it 

By Felix Bloch's recollection, during the seminar where Schrödinger presented de Broglie's wave-particle duality ideas, Debye mentioned that such a discussion was imprecise. Debye stated that any system which truly had wave-like properties should be associated with a wave equation. Thus Schrödinger's task was set. Weeks later he obtained the Klein-Gordon equation and weeks after that he applied it to the hydrogen atom and found the associated eigenvalue spectrum. But the eigenvalues (expressed in terms of half, rather than whole, integers) did not match the confirmed predictions of the old quantum theory of Bohr. Consequently, Schrödinger developed a new equation, the current three-dimensional time independent Schrödinger equation, and found that when it was applied to the hydrogen it reproduced the correct spectrum. 






He was  much older than de Broglie and Einstein when they did their respective work (38 compared to their 32 and 24 respectively), and also well past the accepted age beyond which physicists can supposedly no longer do important work. 




By 1926, the improbably young Heisenberg had already overhauled much of quantum theory with his formulation of what was known as matrix mechanics. Heisenberg’s formulation of quantum mechanics was grounded in operators represented as matrices whose elements corresponded to the quantum analogs to classical observable quantities like position and momentum. In addition to establishing his famous uncertainty principle, Heisenberg had applied his quantum mechanics to study the energy spectrum of a particle in a harmonic oscillator well and to the hydrogen atom. In this latter case he was able to reproduce the standard experimental result (discovered by ???) that the energy levels of the hydrogen atom are discrete and given by. 

(Energy Levels) 

Thus with Heisenberg’s work physicists were comfortable with abandoning the old quantum theory of Bohr (You might have seen Bohr’s model of the electron in a chemistry class where it was used to motivate (Equation above)), for one which although much being comparatively less intuitive was much more theoretically sound. 

Earlier, in 1924 a Ph. D student named Louis de Broglie published his dissertation where he used Einstein’s ideas on special relativity to argue that quantum particles could be defined not only in terms of particle-like quantities such as momentum but also wave-like quantities like wavelength. In particular, he established the relation between wavelength and momentum to be 

\lambda = h/p


when physicists can do good 

 to argue that quantum particles also had wave like properties and could be defined not only in terms of a momentum as such particles are defined but in terms of a wavelength, the relation between the two being

\lambda = h/p 

to argue that quantum particles in addition to having the typical dynamical properties like momentum also had wavelike properties 


This was the state of affairs when Schr



By 1926, Heisenberg had largely completed his formulation of matrix mechanics a quantum mechanics grounded in matrices whose elements defined observable quantities in the quantum realm and had applied his framework/work/system/it to the problem of a harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom. He was able to reproduce the standard result (discovered by ?)  that the  energy levels of the hydrogen atom are discrete and given by

Writing Tips #22: The Ladder of Abstraction

One cannot deny that motivation at its most basic level is value dependent. What drives us, what keeps us pursuing something beyond failures and setbacks is contingent on what we see as worthy of pursuit. And in spite of the communities we form and relationships we build, these values are deeply personal. In fact, what often divides communities and spells the destruction of relationships is an immiscibility of values. One person or one group of people trying to enact a philosophy of life which puts them at odds with another person or group. 

What schools try to do—the same thing that virtually all institutions from advertising to governments try to do—is influence values ever before they need to directly influence behavior. The idea is that if you can get people motivated in a certain way, one does not need to constantly prod them with sticks and carrots for them to behave; their behavior grows and extends naturally from what they have been taught to value. Schools are especially adept at this because they are the de facto required community for millions of young people and thus have a greater opportunity to shape and develop human values as needed. But for me, my family largely served as the crucible for value development and although the influences from my school environment proved strong, I continued to feel greater affinity to influences at home. 

And I think it was the time I spent in this home and the work I was able to do in it which ultimately led me into such great (but strangely never explicit) conflict with Jesse and Ariel. Whether they realized it or not—and how could they realize it when I could hardly realize it myself?—their work was less valuable to me in a way I could not perfectly hide from myself. While working with Jesse, I had begun questioning why I was working for him, and such questioning led ultimately to a confrontation with the reality I was living due to its contrast with the reality I believed I occupied. The ideals of knowledge and its extension, my belief in the beauty of physics, they were all rhetorical exercises in obfuscation; mostly I was working to impress Jesse. The work had little meaning to me apart from his evaluation of it, and so, divorced from his direction I always felt lost and unmotivated. This was my undoing as I started  projects believing that Jesse would somehow carry me to their completion. But he had made it clear that the work was mine to do, and it became clear that to do it, I would need to care about it much more than I did. 

Now, whenever I work on a project, I make this contrast between imagined and lived realities explicit from the beginning and I try my best to align and realign myself with the latter. Are you, I ask myself, doing the work for the right reasons? Right in this case isn’t associated with some moral compass, but based on who measures the value of the work. Am I again trying to impress authority figures both real and imagined? Or is the work valuable regardless of whether someone deems it such?

***

I recently completed six baby physics pedagogy notes. It took me roughly a week longer than I anticipated to complete them, and to pull me through the lapses in motivation and focus I tried to envision 
what I was working towards. The question: what really did I want to achieve? In response, my mind kept drifting to Jacob and to what he would think of the notes. Indeed much of the reason I recently acquired the drive to complete the work was because of the prospect of working with him. I have not heard much of his views on teaching philosophy, but I believed his basic appreciation and valuing of teaching would lead him to be more receptive to my softer methods of physics education than other teachers. 

But I of course recognized something dangerous in this motivation. It is something our education instills from the beginning: your work only has value if some authority figure bestows upon it value. In fact it was this idea, lying in the background, unstated yet all-affecting, which led me to so long remain working on projects I didn’t care about. The value system was set and calibrated according to the possibility of external regard and then it became impossible to sense anything internally affecting or important in the work at all. For so long I was working for someone else, for something else, for something which one could argue had less reality than one’s own dreams and worse still it was a reality entirely dependent on the dreams of another.

I now know I have to relinquish such a hierarchy of values system because they push me toward work which although ostensibly more rewarding is ultimately self-alienating, making me feel lonely and disconnected due to an abnegation of self.

My philosophy for work is two-fold: Do the good work; Share the work with others. It is the last part in this philosophy that I am at last working toward, but the danger is that one can become so focused on the sharing that one can no longer see value in the work outside of how it is received by others. Each time my mind drifts to this framing on the world, I recoil away endeavoring to recenter myself along a value system which I know will not lead me to be alienated from myself. 

I respect Jacob, more so than I respect many of the other tenured Professors at Harvard. Particularly because he doesn’t force me to engage in the sort of contextual interpretation of his character that I am forced to engage with with other Professors because they seem incapable of hiding their experiential myopia. I don’t have to say “This guy is acting strangely callous and abrupt probably because he hasn’t been around many people who look like me,” because Jacob has perhaps intentionally and consistently been the opposite of callous and abrupt. So I respect Jacob, and with this respect comes trust, and with this trust comes the danger that I will fall into old habits and begin trusting Jacob’s opinion of my work more so than I do my own. 

Our education system has a way of cultivating this personal disregard. Less cynically much of learning requires it: If you’re going to learn from someone who is more knowledgeable and more experienced than you are, you have to mostly take their word and opinion as gospel so that you can build skills in the areas in which you’re deficient. But we are people, and as people we work in response to motivations and not merely according to what makes sense from an epistemic perspective. So although it is true that learning requires a subordination, if only temporary, of personal standards of value to external standards, the way this subordination is actually encouraged makes no reference to the realities of learning. Instead students are taught, through incentives and their lack, that what others think of their work has an immediate consequence in the institutions they find themselves, while what they think of their own work—although given adequate lip service—has an abstract value which many pretend does not exist because it has no immediate reflection in the world they occupy.

Such incentives are primarily responsible for much of the short-sighted thinking apparent in all kinds of work from high energy physics to news articles. Unable to perceive a value beyond the values of the moment, people are pushed and pulled as large communities directed and influenced by forces they cannot understand. 

Recently I have been asking myself another question. Are you working to cater to the systems of power, prejudice, and influence which currently exist? Working to gain favor in the eyes of those who currently sit atop the hierarchies of power? Or does your work make contact with a truth which lies beyond such systems? A grandiose question but an important one. At the very least having it at the back of your mind will force you to acknowledge that all work has a historical context and that being too faithful to such a context could lead to obsolescence as soon as the reigns of power are transferred to the next generation.

Academic Tutoring Program - Best Practices

In the first meeting, have a conversation with your tutee to help set the stage for a good working relationship. Remember that the tutee may be feeling nervous! So take a bit of time to get to know each other and to set expectations about tutoring.

Introduce yourself. Say something about your academic interests and ask your tutee about their interests, as well. It’s good to start off with their strengths, before you jump into their difficulties or questions. 

Ask your tutees what they would like help with and what they hope for from tutoring (e.g., help with problem sets, practice using new vocabulary, particular concepts, etc.)

Talk with them about how they can make the best use of your tutoring hours - e.g., try to star a problem set before meeting with you, or look over the reading first and come in with questions. 

Describe anything relevant about your own teaching/learning style and encourage tutees to let you know when you have not been clear or when they need something explained in a different way. 

One strategy to encourage the tutee to take charge of their own learning is to have the tutee, rather than you, be the one who is doing all the writing (equations, diagrams, etc.). An additional benefit of this strategy is that it helps ensure that all written work is the tutee’s and not yours.

From Nothing to Something

I was at yet another roadblock with the thermal permutations project. My previous calculation of the phase behavior of the order parameter was incorrect which meant my beautiful phase diagram which was derived from it was also incorrect. I had realized days before that I needed to start again, but now the mathematics had reached a point of intractability and I could not see how to proceed. 

I was in uncertain territory, and the only thing that comforted me was that I knew even with the project far from complete I had found “something”, that if before I was chasing a phantom, now the phantom had materialized into a tangible being and even if it was still not in my grasps it was unquestionably a part of the world that all may someday see. I have often analogized the process of working through an investigation as akin to traveling through an unknown city. The landmarks you find appear in the distance and you make them real to yourself and to other people by finding traversable paths to them. Here was a landmark which I saw rising above other buildings and hidden behind fences and gates I did not know how to climb. I had no idea if I could reach this landmark, but at least I knew it was there. 

One could argue that this is really the difficult part of an investigation: finding out whether there is really something worth investigating. Yes, yes; all questions deserve to be asked even if they do not lead to interesting projects, but when you ask a new question there is a decidedly different feeling in discovering that the answer is something you’ve never seen before versus discovering that it is something which is just a variation on something else. Once you push the investigation far enough to see that there really is something new there (and I currently have no idea how one determines this), the remaining work concerns explicating and outlining it to the best of one’s abilities. Of course, one would be limited in this latter regard but the fact that what you’re describing is indeed real and part of the world will hopefully center you and make the task less rife with ambiguity than it could be. 

Moving from nothing to something is really the crucial aspect of any investigation. The process is messy and one ends up having to use personal biases as a lens to focus and push forward the work until the wrongness of those biases are manifest, and thus ones goes through any manner of mental gymnastics just to get to a point where one can see what is worth seeing. It is inevitably slow going and requires dutiful applications of attention and religious devotions of time. What one finds in the end ultimately determines whether the ordeal was worth it.

Noticing and Identifying in Theoretical Physics
Years ago in an attempt become a better physicist and make up for the deficiencies in my institutionally wrought education, I made a list of the skills needed to do work in theoretical physics. The skills I listed were question formulation (being able to formulate a question); question specification (being able to move from an ill-defined question to a more specific one); principle formulation/model building (being able to induce principles for a system and use those principles for predictions); extension and generalization (being able to extend the original circumstances of a model to encompass larger ones). Added to this list should be the much focused upon skill of problem solving. But even this accounting is largely incomplete. There is one skill which is not merely rarely taught in physics, but is one that even I couldn’t see until recently. 

I think there is something about physics and the way those who study it see themselves and the subject which affects its development. 

There is something about the inciting motivations of physicists which biases a particular way of interpreting the subject. For example, many physicists see their work as largely antithetical to the work of biologists—although this really can’t be stated absolutely given the new studies on the physics of living systems. Theoretical Physicists are unabashedly mathematical in their work and this structure gives their young a certain hubris in their striving. For them, what is true in a physical theory could be derived mathematically from the theory’s basic principles, and so one does not need to rely on an institution or an authority figure to give one the lab space or the equipment to study and develop a new piece of the science; one can develop the science at one’s desk in one’s room. 

But biologists are connected to a whole pantheon of sensibilities and predilections which often have atrophied in the mature student of theoretical physics. Because in lieu of a mathematical framework which in a way necessitates new discoveries, biologists must perform experiments and be very careful in paying attention to what they observe. They must pay careful attention to what reality is telling them about its structure. For theoretical physicists the dictation often proceeds in the opposite direction for when they are are not focusing on building principle based frameworks, they are almost unilaterally focused on deriving and making predictions, in other words on making proclamations about how reality works. 

This tendency resulted in a sort of preternatural blindness in me. Because of course if you’re making predictions, you are largely dependent on an existing formalism which is (as all formalisms are) quite limited. As a result you inevitably run into predictions and results which do not make sense within the context of the formalism and require an expanded sense of its possibilities to adequately understand. In such a position, if one constantly demands that what one sees fit within the framework of all that one has previously seen, frustration is the only outcome. The only way to get past such obstacles is to relax the predictive intent and start observing and noticing and identifying the novel elements which ultimately point to new formalisms. 

This is something (I’m guessing) biologists are better at than most theoretical physicists. A month and a half ago Suzanne Smith gave me an article by Schudder on the importance of careful and patient observation in science. The article’s focus was more specific than all of science (it was concerned with the study of fish), but the principles I think are generally applicable. Indeed, recently while working on the thermal permutations project I was tasked with finding a new description for the phase behavior of the interacting mean field system. I had previously (but incorrectly) described the phase behavior and now I needed to modify the former description to account for the results of my Monte Carlo analysis. In the end I had to scrap the former results and pay attention to what results were apparent in the system. It was partly the lessons from this article which made the task possible.

Time and Attention (and choice)
In order to understand anything requires time and attention. Both are components of focus, which is itself part of the trifecta I have realized is required to do any sort of work—focus, faith, patience, and a daily application of all three. 

It seems our culture works to limit/cripple our understanding of anything by making us misuse the former and poorly apply the latter. 

Of course, just as important is the choice of what one should apply their time and attention to.

Third Time Derivative in American Politics
“I should be elected because the rate at which inflation is increasing is decreasing”

During his calculus lecture, Jacob mentioned a quote by Richard Nixon. Jacob stated the quote was: “I should be re-elected because the rate at which inflation is increasing is decreasing.” This statement, Jacob explained, conceptually used the idea of the third derivative. First, inflation is the rate at which value of money changes (namely decreases) in time and hence it can be seen as the first derivative of value with respect to time. Next, if one says the rate of inflation is increasing, then this is equivalent to saying the rate of the rate of change in value is increasing, or, more simply, the second derivative of the value of money must be positive. Finally, if the rate at which inflation is increasing is decreasing, then this means the second derivative is decreasing in time, or that the third derivative is negative. 

I should mention that this quote might be apocryphal; I have not been able to find the Nixon speech which it is supposedly based on. The original source of the story seems to be the mathematician Hugo Rossi’s short note to an AMS journal.

Defining Physics
In the first lecture for Physics S-10, Jacob asked the students to try to define physics. The students a majority of whom were still in high school listed some pretty good definitions (the study of energy and matter and their interactions, the study of the rules of natures, a mathematical representation of the universe), but one in particular stood out to me: “Physics is what you get if you keep asking why.” I think this is an excellent definition, provided it is made more precise. For it is not at all true that if you keep asking why about everything and in all directions that your questions will eventually be reduced to a problem in physics. Rather, if you keep asking “Why?” about inanimate objects or physical processes, then you will almost certainly end up at some physical theory, but if you keep asking why about humans and anything involving human or animal behavior then you most certainly will reach an impasse in front of which lies everything that is alive, psychological, seemingly chaotic, and which we do not really understand and behind which, over a moat and at a far distance, lies the physical theories we understand much better and which we inaccurately claim encompass the world.

Factorials and Prime Numbers
In class Jacob mentioned that it was possible to use the definition of the factorial to prove why there is no greatest prime number. According to Jacob, the proof was first developed by Euclid. I can’t remember the exact details but I believe you assume $p$ is the largest prime number, and then you compute $p!+1$. You divide this quantity by a number $x$ which is less than $p$. There is no such number 
Using factorials to prove that there is no greatest prime number 

Relativity and Light
This is a possible conceptual problem that Jimmy or Chuanyi asked Jacob. He said when someone is moving towards the sun the light of the sun is blue shifted (the frequency increases), yet while that person passes the sun and begins moving beyond it the sunlight is redshifted suggesting that the light now has a different frequency and hence a different energy. This “suggests” energy conservation is violated. Why isn’t this true.

If you are young and your sense of your self is malleable enough to be influenced and influencable by your environment these so called “micro-aggressions” are sufficiently virulent as to be seen as a legitimate threat. It makes sense that there is largely an age divide between those who fear the move towards political correctness and those who claim it’s necessity. They can and do affect how you see yourself and the attack can seem down right existential. There is this quote by baldwin in this regard, which essentially boils down to Racism makes black people crazy, which is true. 

If you have not yet learned to see the prejudices and biases others use to understand us as more reflective of their ignorance than your identity then it’s probable that you’re not older than 21. 




The truth, of course, is that women are just as invested in the ideas of manhood as men are. And I say just as intentionally here, because we kno

Ising Model of a Gas - Hard Sphere and Zero Dimensional Particles
This was prompted by a students question in class. What is the statistical model for the Ising model, where the positions of each spin along the one-dimensional lattice can move? 

If we assume the Hamiltonian could be sequestered into an exclusive spin dependent part and an exclusive translation dependent part then we simply multiply the partition functions for each respective model 
I call this uncoupled spin and translational motion. Two models that immediately come to mind are the Tonks model (of hard rods confined to one dimension) and the regular ideal gas model in one dimension. 

- If we assume the Hamiltonian cannot be sequestered in this way, is it possible to develop a Hamiltonian which is both physically relevant and soluble? Namely, a Hamiltonian which is dependent on both the positions of the particles and their spins and which results in a soluble partition function for the spins after we sum over the positions (or vice versa). 

Random Walk Model 
Could any of this be relevant to a random walk model?

Attractors, Letters, and Numbers 
In class today Jacob gave many wonderful examples of attractors. First he defined a system with an attractor as one in which the dynamics flows to one or collection of states. “States” were defined as the various possible configurations of a system, and “dynamics” were defined as rules which take one state to another. Here were his examples. 

Example 1: Letters and numbers
State Space: possible english phrases 
Dynamics: Count the number of characters in that phrase; The new phrase is the number of characters written as a word. 

Whatever phrase you begin with you ultimately evolve to a state where the phrase is four. This is because four is the only phrase where the dynamics brings you back to the starting phrase. All other phrases evolve away from this value. 

Example 2: Collatz Conjecture 
State Space: All positive integers
Dynamics: If the integer n is odd the new integer is 3n+1; if the integer is even the new integer is n/2. 

The attractors in this system are the set of states 1, 4, 2. There apparently is no formal proof of this. 

Example 3: All roads lead to philosophy
State Space: Wikipedia encyclopedia page
Dynamics: On an existing page click on the the first link (besides pronunciation and etymology) which takes you to a new page. 

This is a more of a qualitative example, but Jacob elaborated it excellently. Beginning on an arbitrary page, you eventually reach the page for philosophy about 95% of the time. In the remaining 5% of cases you reach a page without any links, a page which doesn’t exist, or a series of pages which are a self contained loop. 

In the case of philosophy itself, the page returns doesn’t simply stay at philosophy but does eventually return to it. 

Ergodicity Breaking
We call a system ergodic if over an infinite duration of time it explores all possible states in its configuration space. A system breaks ergodicity when it is no longer ergodic. In a sense all of the above systems must break ergodicity because the attractors lead to the system being confined to only a part of its configuration space for long times. 

However, the example that Jacob gave was that of an Ising ferromagnet. He noted that the system at sufficiently low temperatures breaks ergodicity because the system is confined to have positive magnetization $m = +1$ or $m=-1$. 
(I’m actually not sure about this example. In this case is it correct that the thermal equilibrium system isn’t exploring all parts of its configuration space? Or is it more correct to say that the probability to be in various parts of the configuration space have changed?)

The Work of The Future
There are many moments when I think about the projects I planned for the future and I feel in me a swell of inspiration and promise. But at these moments I must check myself for these visions of my future are predicated on my doing work that I have not yet done and which I am not absolutely sure I can do. To spend too long engaging with them rather than the actions of reality which are their natural antecedents is to doom myself to perpetual fantasy. 

It is the work which must take precedence before the fantasy, before anything to which I believe the realization of the fantasy may lead. This work, displaced from my present by a journey I have yet to take, is not yet included in the reality of the world. I want to enact this inclusion, but it is fraught with ambiguities, with questions I have not yet answered, questions which may have no answer whatsoever. Still, I will try to answer them, breathing deeply of this uncertainty and trying to make of it something upon which others can stand.

Energy Conservation and the Universe
Today Jacob mentioned that energy is not absolutely conserved in our universe because this universe has a time dependent evolution. I have never heard of this; I should investigate further. 

Physics is often thought of as an excellent introductory scientific subject because students learn both science and a way of thought conducive to solving problems in general. In this article we argue that there is a missing curriculum in the implicit problem solving education in physics, and this missing curriculum is grounded in the focus of problem solving on well articulated problems rather than the less defined problems which better model the problems a student may encounter outside the class. 




Physics is often seen as an excellent introductory scientific subject because students learn not only a basic science but also, through the logical problems they solve, a way of thinking which is conducive to solving problems in general. In this article, we debate this idea and argue that in physics classes students do not in fact learn generalizable problem-solving skills because their education is too focused on solving well articulated problems rather than the less defined problems which better model the problems a student may encounter outside a formal class. We use personal and historical examples to obtain a better sense of what’s missing in the current instruction of the problem-solving process, and we conclude with a discussion of ways to incorporate these missing elements into the classroom today. 

July 8, 2016 — Friday 5:25 PM
I have lost my focus. I am currently working on two projects which are far from complete. One is the essay on an apolitical education, the other is the thermal permutations project. The thermal permutations project is suffering under the general problem of metastasis; it keeps getting longer and longer. The apolitical education essay is waffling on the edge of existence; each time I think of concluding it I think of something which makes my existing analysis seem trite and incomplete. I have been wasting my time on TV shows, and other distractions. So here is my declaration: I will not listen to a podcast, or watch a TV show until

I’ve completed the phase analysis and Ising interaction analysis for the permutation model. 
I have written and submitted a draft of an apolitical education to suzanne smith.

We’ll see how well this goes.

Dear Dr. Hightower,

I hope Franklin Prep went well this year and your summer is also going well. And hopefully your home renovations are proceeding smoothly and your neighbor is no longer bothered by them, or at least the relationship has improved so that the previous problems aren’t an issue anymore. 

Included in this package is a copy of one Harvard’s literary journals containing one of my recent short stories. I think I previously thanked you for giving me a better appreciation of writing in high school. The editors of the journal said they liked the writing in my submitted piece, and whenever someone compliments my writing I think about the people who taught me how to write, and you’re one of them so I’m thanking you again.

I’m currently trying to convey some of that appreciation to the students in a physics course I’m teaching this summer. I think much of the false divide between humanistic and mathematical subjects comes because people rarely practice both in the same context, so I’m trying to teach these students to practice good writing even when they’re explaining mathematical or physical concepts. 

I hope you enjoy the rest of your summer. 

Best,
Mobolaji

There is only some consistency/overlap between the students listed as collaborators, so I think it’ll be easier to list the students who apparently don’t have any collaborators.  I think this because the students don’t all work in groups, but some rather work individually and ask others for help when they need it. So you have something like Nina having worked with six people including Sarah Flynn, while some one else who worked with Jordan

Writing Tool #1: Begin Sentences with Subjects and Verbs

Jacob stated last Tuesday that the paradoxes of special relativity aren’t really paradoxes because the contradictions which define them disappear when you analyze them carefully. In this sense he called them faux paradoxes in distinction real paradoxes like the phrase “This statement is false” whose contradiction is manifest in the fact that it can neither be true nor false. 

If I recall correctly, Gödel’s work in mathematical logic shows that it is impossible to remove from mathematics such statements. I remember people taking this to mean that not every statement in mathematics can be proven, but could we also take it to mean that mathematics is paradoxical?



Waves on a Train

Jacob also mentioned that due to special relativity and the rear clock ahead effect. Propagating waves can look like instantaneous waves in certain reference frames. I should clarify that I don’t mean this precisely in the way I seem to mean it, namely it is not that propagating waves can look like standing waves which is certainly a prediction of Galilean Relativity.

Rather, say you have a series of $N$ oscillators with the oscillations arranged sequentially along a line such that the axis of oscillation for each is perpendicular to that line. The oscillators all have the same frequency, and they all have the same initial conditions so they are always in phase. Now, put this series of oscillators on a train, and take that train to be moving with a velocity v. From the perspective of someone on the ground, the train would seem to contain not a single spatially distended oscillation (as the oscillators seem to appear within the train), but a standing wave. 

This is because, due to the rear clock ahead effect the person on the ground frame sees the interior of the train at different points in it’s own interior time. So while the mass farthest to the front of the train is seen (from the ground frame) at t=0, the mass slightly to the left of this first mass is seen at t=t_1>0, and so on.  Thus the person on the ground sees a standing wave (with Neumann boundary conditions) confined to the interior of the train. 

My question is can this fact be reflected in a wave equation. 

Be Suspicious
If there was only one piece of knowledge—ostensibly only scientific—that you could preserve for the generations to come, what would it be? “Everything is made of atoms,” was Feynman’s response because he believed from this statement one could then be led to many of the major developments of modern physics. Of course this belief is grounded in many unqualified assumptions about language. For one, it assumes that what we mean by atoms could not be misinterpreted by these future generations to mean something else in their environment. What if they take it to mean what we think of as energy? Or what we think of as strings (in string theory)? Or what people more spiritually think of as the soul? Also, what does “everything” correspond to? Is it every physical thing, or every abstract thing? Light is physical (although insubstantial); is it too made from atoms? Is love made from atoms?

But Feynman’s statement is also dubious given the constraints of the problem. Our modern sense of what an atom “is” is based on scientific instrumentation that these generations would not have had access to since the only piece of scientific knowledge they have is the statement “Everything is made of atoms.”

In class on Tuesday (July 19), Jacob didn’t provide these arguments against Feynman’s statement, but he did add his own perspective on the question of what piece of knowledge we should preserve. His was less concrete than Feynman’s and consequentially not as limited by the subtleties of language. He suggested that we tell future generations to “Be suspicious of common sense” which could be variously translated to “Be wary of what appears to be obvious” or “Question apparently simple and shallow explanations.” This was after he started his lectures on Special relativity a subject which indeed makes his advice seem eminently appropriate. But his suggestion is perhaps solid advice in general.

The irony came later in the night when I was watching the Republican National Convention. Donald Trump Jr., Donald Trump’s son, was speaking and at one point he mentioned that the people he and his siblings most learned from in his life were not the credentialed elite: “We didn’t learn from MBAs, we learned from people who had doctorates in common sense.” To my dismay, everyone cheered

It is perhaps more so an indication of my own parochialism than anything true to our culture, that I haven’t experienced  directly America’s famous anti-intellectualism. Baldwin spoke of it and indeed many writers have and still do, and yet I have not personally observed it. But again, I spent many of my formative years alone in libraries and I spent the first years of my adulthood inside small enclaves of intellectual thought, so I recognize that my perspective might be skewed. 

I wonder however what this anti-intellectualism looks like when encountered in real-time. I am currently in Southern Alabama visiting my mom, and each time I step outside and walk amongst the denizens here I can’t help but feel that they occupy a world starkly different from my own. In my world the heroes are Baldwin, Chomsky, Aisha Tyler, and Lightman, heroes whose wider value is so obvious to me, so clearly “common sense”, that I sometimes imagine that this value is universally recognized. Of course, this is not true and cannot be true because the value I find in these people is grounded in the things I value in my world, and out of the many lessons gleaned from this world’s politics the one that should now be clear to me is that different people value different things. 

Perhaps it is a reaction to the unquestionable unequal distribution of opportunity in this country. Those denied the opportunities of the higher education must perhaps make the loss fundamental to a positive identity in order to prevent it from becoming a marker of shame. And thus by some perverse but seemingly requisite symmetry, the marker of shame is attached to those who have had access to those opportunities and the opportunity’s realization soon becomes evidence enough for a deficiency in character. You keep people on the outside long enough, eventually they’ll pick up a brick even if it is only a metaphorical one to protect themselves from your implicit attacks on their identity.

You must meet reality where it is before you can bring it to where you want it to be.

None of us are perfect, and we all have qualities which should make us unsure as to whether strangers will readily accept us. The insecure simply have a firmer grounding in this reality than the rest of us. 

My sister thinks she’s a better writer than I am so she never asks for my help to edit her essays. Of course she is a better writer than I am which, I think, is beside the point. 


Tony the Tiger
July 29, 2016 — Thursday 

Three nights ago Tony and I lay in my bed together, him on his back and me on my side looking at his closed eyes. My left hand was in his hair, my fingers combing through it, and my right hand was in his boxers. “Is this strange?” I asked him. “What?” he asked his eyes still closed. “The fact that I like you now. I mean, is it strange that I changed?” He laughed, “No” he said. I suppose it was a stupid question; I knew the truth. This was strange, because I never believed it could happen months ago. Back then, I was struggling with the question of whether it would ever be possible for me to like someone again, whether there was enough space and affection inside me to let someone else in and have them exist sanely with me. 

Ever since I met him, I kept Tony at an arm’s length because I told myself that this way when I stopped allowing him to see me, the pain on his end would be minimal. He wouldn’t have given me anything and I wouldn’t have given him anything and so we could both part, neither of us feeling cheated or bitter. Such bitterness, I had found, was inevitable in almost all my relationships with women. I had always felt that they were not completely honest with me, never as honest as they could be, never as kind. In my mind this duplicity was a choice and consequently I couldn’t help but see these women as less than they perhaps actually were. And to evade my own potential hypocrisy, and the way observed immorality can filter down into your own character making you believe you have the right to be as terrible to everyone else as everyone apparently is to you, I decided to be different. I wanted to protect Tony from the callousness which I knew was just as possible in me as it was in everyone else. 

But there were lapses in my management of this distance. On April 1st, a week after I first met Tony and a week after that essay where I discussed being on the precipice of a change, I went to his house. There he quite effectively seduced me—or had I allowed myself to be seduced? We started off in his bed watching the movie Short Term 12. At the start of the movie I lay still, with my hands clasped and resting on my stomach. I was silent and closed, shut out from my own desires and trying to keep his at bay. He slowly worked to get me to open up. With all my clothes on, he rubbed my stomach and my chest. It was all incredibly awkward for me, and so I couldn’t stop smiling and laughing, an involuntary physical hedge against the tension I felt. Eventually he did something, still completely above the belt, and the scale which weighed fear against desire tilted and soon both of our clothes were off and I was straddling him breathing tensely in and out. Afterwards, sanity descended again upon me, and I couldn’t help but vocally express disbelief at what just happened. He agreed, saying he had thought it would be weeks before anything like that happened between us, but also that such things could never really be anticipated; they came from people responding to what they felt in the moment. What had I felt in the moment? It was no longer really clear, but what I certainly felt afterwards was regret. 

In all the books I’ve read about one’s feelings after a first homosexual experience the dominant one is shame and disgust. I felt not disgust and the shame was not that I had the experience but that it was had before any emotional foundation had been established. It was only the second time I was meeting with him, and yet here we were both of our clothes off, him asking if he could hold me in his arms. After some time I asked him to drive me back home. I still lived on Saybrook Street then, on the edge of Brighton. A mile from my home I told him to drop me off; I needed to walk. I need to think. 

At the end of the night he had asked me if I was OK. I was not. It was the first sexual experience of my recent adulthood, the first sexual experience since I was in pre school. Something I had always claimed to want, and yet here it was and I could not help wishing it had never happened. The morning after he texted me saying hello. I wanted to ignore the text. I wanted him to go away. But I knew that was how most people today responded to events they wished had never happened; they simply pretended that the wish was true and tried their best to erase the event and the people associated with it from their lives. It is not perfectly conscious so one could not say it was deliberately malicious, but I could not help feeling I was being brought into contact with the darker aspects of human identity when I was on the receiving end of such erasure. 

So I decided that if I was going to put an end to this I would do it through full-disclosure. No hiding or running. He asked when he could see me again. I told him Monday, the sooner the better, I thought, to get this over with. We met in Harvard’s second courtyard, the one framed by Jefferson, the Law School Library, Pierce, and Maxwell Dworkin buildings. While we were walking through the labyrinthine tunnels of the surrounding buildings, he grabbed my hand. I held his arm with my free hand and disengaged myself. “Let’s not…” I trailed. He asked me if I was OK. I told him we should find some place to talk. My plan was for us to go to the Harvard book store, but it had just snowed and the pavement was watery and slush-filled. We went to the Law School student center instead, and sat in the enclave of tall and small tables behind the first floor grill. I can’t remember what we talked about, but I eventually got to the point where I admitted to him that I just wanted to be friends and that what had happened a few nights ago could never happen again. “Never?” he asked. “Never,” I confirmed. He seemed to have taken it well. I talked about my reservations surrounding sex and intimacy. What was clear was that imagining and engaging in both were difficult for me. What was not so clear was why. 

He said he was OK with this. In his words, we could still be friends. I conceded verbally and as I walked with him back to his car I played with the idea that this would be the last night I’d see him. Days later he texted me and I responded, and days after that he texted me again, and I responded again. It was correspondence born of politeness, born from a desire to not reflect the cursory and laissez-faire attitude women always had when contacting me. But in retrospect, the consequence of this politeness was a relationship which grew between us in spite of my decision to keep him away. 

——

An unfair question: Would Tony like me/be attracted to me if I didn’t look the way I did? If I didn’t have what American culture calls an “athletic build” would he have even messaged me in the first place? The question is unfair for two reasons: One because I already know the answer (it is a negative); Two because I’m assuming answer implies something incomplete about Tony’s character. 

Still, I want to ask him this question, perhaps not to know what his answer truly is—for neither I nor he can possibly know this—but to know what he thinks his answer is. Why does he think he likes me? What does he tell himself for why he liked me after the first time we met and seemingly still does? This is a self-serving question in more ways than the obvious one because it rests on the assumption that Tony interrogates his relationships the way I do. All my experiences with him suggest he does not in fact do so, and yet I am still pulled into trying to make him see me through the same analytical framing I see him. 

He perhaps doesn’t really know why he messaged me, and he maybe doesn’t really think of it because to him it doesn’t really matter. 

We’ve had conversations about similar questions. He’s told me he’s mostly attracted to black guys, and his profile on Jack’d (which lists the demographic categories of the guys he most contacts/who most contact him) is consistent with this. I told him that I’m mostly attracted to asian guys, probably because the first guy I ever liked was Chinese. Maybe, I told him, I’m trying to approach again what I never really attained. He didn’t take offense to this, the fact that I might merely be attracted to him because he was the “right” race. Did I take offense to his confession? There was a twinge of apprehension, a sense that what I thought he felt for me was less real than I had always wanted to believe it was. But I felt this ever more deeply after he told me about the other black guys he had been with. He told me because I wanted to know and because I pressed him on it. Their statistics: they were 24 and 27, both over six feet tall. He didn’t tell me exactly what he did with them—and now, in retrospect, I am dying to know—only that he was “with” them and that the 24 year old had some growing up to do. 

His comment about their ages led me to another question: What exactly was his age? His profile had said he was 28 years old, but weeks after we met, I developed a subtle intuition that this was not true. He confirmed this later on by being reluctant to tell me the age that was simply on his profile. He said he didn’t update his age very often. So, I asked, how old are you really? 30? 32? He demurred. I still do not know his age, but he told me that he was in his 30s, and now it is perhaps too late for it to matter. 

A year ago I started talking with a guy named Steven. He contacted me through craigslist and we eventually decided to meet. In his first email, he had told me he was 40 years old, but after we exchanged a few texts he confessed that he was actually 50. He was afraid, he explained, that if he told me his real age I wouldn’t want to meet him. This was a legitimate fear and indeed absolutely true. But I disingenuously told him that what bothered me was that he lied about something so trivial as his age. It was the kind of “I’m not angry; just disappointed” lie that parents often tell children. I told him we couldn’t meet and that we should stop talking to each other. Was this cold? Certainly no girl or guy ever gave me such closure when they had stopped being interested; they simply just stopped responding to my texts. But basing standards of morality on a popular average is really just an easy way for terrible people to trick themselves into believing they are actually good. The truth is, at the time, I could not imagine doing anything with a guy who was closer to my dad’s age than to mine. This was clear to me even then, but I wanted to preserve the falsehood that I was a moral, not superficial, person so I told him a lie which placed the onus of immorality on his lie rather than on mine. 

This is to say I can be just as shallow as everyone else, and that my demonization of their shallowness is not a reflection of my moral superiority but is simple hypocrisy. And so maybe if Tony had told me his age from the beginning I would have put up enough psychological walls that it would have been impossible to develop any sort of human connection with him because I would have been incapable of seeing beyond that label. 
—




What has changed? Something in me, something I cannot control, is making me believe I can trust Tony. And because I feel like I can trust him, that ineffable fear which established barriers as invisible and as impenetrable as glass has melted away, and I find the emotional torrent which that fear must have been holding at bay is now flowing and flowing forth. It is this level of trust which is missing—and will seemingly always be missing—between me and most women. I had learned through repeated mistakes to not implicitly believe that women would treat me as fairly as I felt I should be treated, certainly not as fairly as they always claimed they wished to be treated, but perhaps I had learned the lesson too well for in the place of unqualified attraction had grown absolute aversion. And now whenever a woman acts in a way which is at all reminiscent of how women have acted with me in the past—namely with coyness, modulated and oscillating interest, flakiness—I cannot help but emotionally withdraw. So now for me to be consistently attracted to a woman, she has to have somehow circumvented all the ways societal incentives and punishments might have molded her character to be like that of most other women. (I should mention I’m referring to American women here). What’s clear is that these techniques probably work on most other men—maybe they too would have worked on me had my personal history been different—so women seeing me simply as a subset of the population for whom such tactics are effective would clearly simply apply them as though they would work as well as they always had. 

I’m digressing. Hours before my question, Tony and I were in the movie theatre watching Star Trek: Beyond. The truth: I did not care about the movie; I only wanted to see Tony. The nights before I had been fantasizing about him, dreaming of him, and inside me grew a hunger, raw and wild. Sitting next to him it had felt like I was a machine whose screws were suddenly loosened, as though the viscous fluid through which I had always moved in the world had been diluted and now my movements would not be as constrained. To recall a phrase I used before, It was like exhaling. 

Minutes into the film I asked if I could hold his hand, only later recognizing the chronological symmetry of this statement; Months before Tony had asked me the same question, and with deep reluctance I had said yes. But now, he shook his head telling me no. I was taken aback for a moment, but then he laughed and grabbed my hand. My fingers entwined in his, I rubbed the inside of his hand and grabbed his arm. His hands and arms were soft and smooth, so different from the tense and muscled feel of my own body. Eventually, my hand moved to his thigh, just as smooth and soft as his hands, and I started rubbing his inner inner leg with my thumb moving it in small circles. 

In short, I was distracted. I couldn’t stop thinking of what it would be like to kiss him, to be with him later that night back in my room. 

It took some time to get to this place. Weeks ago we met on the Fourth of July to watch the Charles River Fireworks off the esplanade. While we walked along the edge of the river I thought about this day exactly a year before when I lived in Conant Hall on Harvard’s campus. On that Fourth of July, feeling hemmed in by solitude and encroaching insanity, I put on my running shoes and late into the night took to the streets. My standard running path was Memorial drive, and on this night it was filled with lawn chairs, coolers, and their dark shadowy owners. As I ran through the crowds I felt like I was like a thief fleeing a robbery; I was sure someone would stop me and ask what my business was. But no one stopped me, few even glanced in my direction, and I completed my circuit and returned home to take a shower and go to sleep. 

But this night I was with Tony. We walked up and down the Esplanade trying to find a place to sit. We were late and the areas closest to the Hatch Shell were already filled so we chose a spot Boston-side about halfway between the BU and Mass Ave bridges. A four-foot wall of concrete brick stood between us and the waters below and Tony sat up on the wall as I stood at his side. Throughout the night he took pictures of the Cambridge Skyline and eventually, he told me what he often told me when we were together: “It’s OK, I like you.” What was OK? I can’t remember. But I remember responding by telling him that I liked him too. It was the first time I said anything like it since we had met three months ago, and he took this cooly with a smile, not seeking to know how exactly I liked him. 

Something that’s always confused me about Tony: his passive acceptance of the kind of ambiguities I always felt compelled to define. He seems to read meaning and substance in terms like “Friendship” or phrases like “I like you,” statements in which I can only find meaning by loading them with adjectives and the oft-quoted “context”. Months ago in the Law School, he said it was OK if we could be friends, and I hesitated accepting this, for I did not know what he meant by friendship. In Giovanni’s Room, David pauses for similar reasons and is reprimanded by his friend Jacques for pausing. Jacques knows David’s hesitation comes from the coward’s fear for safety rather than a more innocuous confusion.

But for me, it seems that I was right to be cautious given that by his measure, we are still currently friends. And yet, his definition of friendship seems to allow for spaces of intimacy not at all permissible in my own, to allow us to kiss and touch and talk in a way that I have never done with any of my former friends. Does this mean that those were not true friendships? Does it mean that Tony’s label is a euphemism, which he too realizes as a euphemism, for something else? Does it even matter. 

What is starting to matter to me is that I don’t know Tony in all the superficial ways we all know strangers within 30 minutes of meeting them. That is, I don’t know his true first and last name, and I do not know his age. More significantly, I want to know what he thinks of our “friendship” and I want to know everything (for reasons grounded in insecurity and narcissism) about all the guys he’s recently been with.

I’m astonished that I now care at all about the answers to these questions, when months ago I was willing to accept the vagaries of his identity without question. On that fateful Fourth of July, after the fireworks ended and the Bostonites drifted into the city streets, Tony drove me home. It was past 11pm approaching midnight and we stood on my porch talking. Soon I realized I was trying to prolong our conversation, to suggest any topic that would leave us talking for another five minutes. And inside me swelled something large and iridescent something I could not ignore, something which made it clear that I wanted him. But I could not express it. 

Be careful of masks, they say, for one’s face often grows to fit them. I was stifled by my own habits. Months of denying emotions I feared would lead me to dissolution, had rendered me incapable of finally answering one which I knew would be reciprocated. 

Tony intuited something was wrong. Are you OK, he asked. I gave him a strained smile and nodded. Then  I stepped towards him and wrapped my arms around his body. I wanted to say something honest, something which would totally make him unconfused but “I just really like you,” was all that came out. This time he didn’t just accept this. “You like me…,” he started, “…as more than a friend?” “Yes,” I said finally. We were still embracing and he turned his head toward mine and breathed deeply. He kissed my neck and then my cheek and then our lips met. It was at a time when kissing him was still awkward for me, and although I knew I wanted to be near him, I wasn’t sure how I wanted to physically realize that desire. Another quote from Giovanni’s room is apt: “His touch could never fail to make me feel desire; yet his hot, sweet breath also made me want to vomit.” I stopped it and started laughing again. The house was empty, EJ having yet to return from watching the fireworks with his friends and Brian gone as well. He grabbed my hand and started leading me up the dark stairwell. I knew what would happen if we eventually got to my room, and I wasn’t ready for that to happen again. I stopped him and told him he should go. He hugged me again and kissed me again and left. 

Even then I wasn’t completely sure how I felt about him, or what to do about this confusion. 

What someone does is always a better representation of their character than what they say. But I am a lover of words and I can’t help but feel compelled to articulate motivations which admittedly may be better understood through their consequences. I think it’s so I can get handles on them, so that they can be made more real to me than their fleeting manifestations in the world make them seem. 

Two weeks ago I started talking with another guy, Andreas. We met a day after we chatted on Grindr, and in the first ten seconds of our meeting I was reminded of how little information a picture provides. With a static image you are given a projection of the person not merely stereoscopically but also dispositionally; as your mind fills in the three-dimensional reality implied by the 2-d image, you simultaneously imagine the personality behind that image, but because human personalities do not share the regularities of human anatomy, you are almost always wrong in accurately identifying how that person is.
 
His mother was from Cyrpus. His father was from Iran. An interesting heritage in of itself but made even more so because he identified as Middle-Eastern when he just as well could have identified as European. He was 26, attended Cornell, was just visiting Cambridge for the summer, and was training to become a pharmacist technician. 

We walked through Perry Park that night and I held his hand trying to play the role of a confident man of interest. It did not work and I could not beat back my apprehension, the incredible awkwardness I felt. Eventually, we disengaged and I walked with him back to the house on Parkdale. 

Do women ever feel lonely? I remember asking myself that question a decade ago, deep in the midst of my attempts to get to “know” them. My own loneliness was deep and clear enough that I could at least entertain the idea of talking and communing with someone I was not immediately interested in, but such a philosophy was rarely reciprocated. Instead I constantly found my own loneliness running into walls which suggested there was nothing like it on the other side. 

But sitting in my room with Andreas that night, I felt his loneliness. It was as much in the focus of his gaze as it was in the way he kissed me with abandon. In my room we played a strip-trivia game. For each wrong answer an article of clothing had to be removed. I played the same game with Dat on our second date. It was really just a convoluted way to get two people naked over the course of 30 minutes. But I didn’t want to take it too far. We stripped down to our boxers and then we just lay in my bed together and watched a few episodes of the Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. After a while I said I thought he should go and then he left. 

I was about to say the incident was uneventful, but to do so would make it too clear that I am becoming unappreciative of such encounters. Two decades devoid of any sort of non-platonic human contact, and then I have several such experiences in the course of four months and all of a sudden I can label one as “uneventful”. Is this the way people can become jaded by experiences they always claimed they wanted, be so constantly unfulfilled despite their growing collections of things? 

Still, I left the night feeling strange about it. I don’t even know what compelled me to initiate the meeting, and it had much less import in my mind than Tony later suggested it must have to me.  I remember Tony and I talked about it about a week after July 4th. He had asked me if I trusted him more than I did when we first met, and I had to admit that I did. I even went further; I said I trusted and liked him more than I did any of the other guys I had met. Thus he asked the natural question: Why then was I willing to do things with Andreas, that I was not willing to do with him? My explanation was of the convoluted kind which often indicates the speaker is trying to hide an absence. I told him it was much scarier being with him because I liked him more and hence the potential and danger for emotional withdrawal was greater with him than with anyone else. He told me this answer did not make sense and that I was confused. 

I conceded this latter point. I was confused. True to my prediction, I had grown to like Tony more than I ever thought I could. And yet I seemed incapable of making those feelings manifest in how I treated or behaved around him. Instead I tried my best to hide my emotions from myself to ensure they were properly hidden from him, and I was succeeding all too well. The habits I developed in college (in truth, years before then) still had me in their grips and I could not relinquish them until I relinquished the assumptions which they depended upon. Because if I had learned to hide my feelings in order to protect friendships which could not support the weight of those feelings, why should I continue to hide them now that I found a friendship that could? 

That conversation was the turning point I suppose. After that, I decided to at least try to make my actions more consistent with my feelings. Days later, we attended a Comedy Night at a local bar and the day after he met me at Harvard to get help with his resume. This night he drove me back home, and we sat on my bed together. I don’t believe we kissed at that moment, but minutes later we were. That night we were together for the first time since that last time on April 1st. 

Here is the early chronology of nights I’ve been “with” Tony

April 1st - The first night

July 4th - Independence day kiss

July 18th - Night after Comedy night; The second night. 

July 26th - Days before Alabama Trip; The third night. The night which begins this essay

So it seems that Baldwin was at least approximately correct when he said one could not choose the person one loves. For me it is true that the feeling was not a choice. It grew in me like an unwatched garden which soon takes over a house, drowning it in green and moss. But although the feeling was there, the choice was still mine as what to do with it. And I guess my ultimate grievance with the world is that it taught me that my own feelings were dangerous, capable, if acted upon, to rob me of the friendships which were a holding place for the deeper intimacies I really wanted. The message was never would those feelings be reciprocated in a way which led to something more than just friendship, so why destroy the friendship by believing it could be anything more? Christine, Fred, Lesley, Stephan, Jessica. It was a lesson it took many years to learn, but I eventually learned it and applied it unconsciously, trying to obscure feelings which I knew were liabilities. There is in me still a righteous egoistic anger that decries the way my personal story unfolded. Sometimes I think to myself if one person was just a little bit nicer, a little less callous, a little more receptive, then I wouldn’t have had to bottle myself up so much. But I know this is wrong on two accounts: for one it relieves me of the responsibility of my, even unconscious, decisions and thus too categorically denies my agency and complicity in this emotional denial; for two, it is an inspection of the world with a focus on what was not there, rather than an appreciation of what currently is. 

And what is currently in my world? Tony is, or at least, I like to believe he is. Tonight I have a date planned with him. I texted him over 12 hours ago, trying to confirm details and he hasn’t responded, but I like to believe we will still meet. Still this prolonged silence touches something in me, something dark, familiar, and self-preserving, something which I know could, if listened to, immediately end whatever exists between Tony and I. I have used this thing to throw away many friendships, thrown them away the way a sinking ship might toss overboard the treasure chests which seem to be accelerating its destruction. For the unintended consequence of love is vulnerability. You attach your happiness to the whims and concessions of kindness of another person and are ever after at the mercy of their character. 

This thing is still calling me and I am on the verge of  listening to it. But I know it calls me onto the coward’s path, the path lived according to what one fears instead of what one loves.

I am attracted to anyone who does not so constantly remind me of my own insecurities. But my insecurities are so innumerable and multifarious that they are always being reflected back at me through gazes, inflections in speech, and especially explicit rejection. Thus I find it difficult to be attracted to anyone because in my interactions with a girl or a guy, it seems I can’t help but be reminded of everything I hate about myself. It’s narcissism, pure and simple. And like all narcissism, it destroys the self through constant attention by making every problem about that self. 

It seems Baldwin was at least approximately correct: It is difficult to choose who you love; you are instead a passenger on a ship whose reaction to the waves and surroundings was etched into its very design before the start of any journey.

For Jamal, talking to women was like playing “Wheel of Insecurity”. Each time his eyes locked onto a woman’s and she would look away, the wheel was spun, the pointer ticking through the various qualities he hated about himself. Sometimes it landed on “You’re too skinny,” or “You’re too tall.” But many times it was lazy in its ambiguity: “You’re not enough.” 

Have I told you I have met with five guys since the time I started using these apps? There was David, the 38 year old computational science programmer; Dat, the 23 year old anthropology student; Jeff, the 36(?) year old aerospace marketing consultant; Andreas, the 26 year old Cornell student; and of course, Tony the 33(?) year old…actually I’m not sure what he does. Another question mark attached to someone I supposedly should know much about. 

My love of words is drawing me to define something else: Although it’s clear that Tony likes me, I want to know how much he does, how much he thinks he does. 

What really made me trust him? My pattern of attraction suggests it takes at least a year of passive interaction with someone before I am unquestionably attracted to them. But Tony and I were interacting pretty actively, albeit completely platonically, over the past four months.

Dreams of an Apolitical Education 

Thermal Permutations Project Elevator Pitch
I’m studying the Statistical Physics of permutations. One motivation is that in biological evolution of stable proteins, what separates distinct proteins can be reduced to the ordering of the amino acid chains which make up the protein. In other words, distinct proteins can be defined by distinct permutations. The goal of the work is to study the equilibrium statistical physics of permutations. Biological systems are inherently out of equilibrium, (not to mention having many complex interactions) but a first equilibrium study can act as a precursor to an non-equilibrium one. 

Why is statistical physics relevant? You apply statistical physics, whenever you have a system defined by a particular energy and where the temperature in some way constrains the probabilities for the system to be in various states. Here temperature could mean thermodynamic temperature or this quantity termed evolutionary temperature which determines how protein diversity fluctuates over time.

States, Kinematics, Dynamics

Jacob’s Introduction to Theoretical Physics course concluded a few days ago. I knew Jacob was a good teacher ever since I took his Introduction to Electrodynamics course a year ago, and it was a great experience to be on the other side. Jacob has many excellent examples of concepts and results in physics. 

He began his lectures without talking about physics at all. Instead, he started by talking about, systems, configuration spaces, and states. Using these terms he develops a good and general definition of a physical system:  e

A physical system is a situation characterized by a configuration space (i.e., a set of states which define the system) along with the rules which define how the system can change from one state to another. 

His examples of configuration spaces and states were similarly non-physical at the start. He considered positions on the real-line, the six sides of a die, the two sides of a coin to give the students a concrete sense of the diversity of possible states. I should note that in physics, the word “states” has a specifically quantum mechanical association but here Jacob uses it generally to represent anything we take to be definitive of a physical system at a certain time. For example the position of a projectile defines the projectile system as a function of time and can thus be taken to define the corresponding state. 

Simple but non physical examples of states and dynamics

Configuration Space: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Dynamics: c_{n+1} = (2*c_{n})mod 3
Kinematics Example: 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, …

Configuration Space: x where x is a real number
Dynamics: x_(n+1) = 2x_n - 3
Kinematics Example: 1, -1, -5, -13, -29, …


In this definition of a physical system, kinematics and dynamics were important terms referring to various ways of characterizing the relationship between states and time. 

Dynamics are the rules which define how states evolve in time. Kinematics are the description of a state’s evolution. Using an association which is perhaps more intuitive in physics, the time dependent equations of motion of a system are an example of dynamics while the solutions to these equations are kinematics. 

The definition of dynamics versus kinematics can be simplified by introducing a new word: trajectory. A trajectory is a sequence of states which represent how a system evolves in time (or according to an index which is analogous to time). By this definition, kinematics refers to the what of the trajectory, while dynamics refers to the why. 

I like Jacob’s definition of a physical system for two reasons: One, we can now consider all areas of physics from the same perspective of states, dynamics, and kinematics of the physical system. That is we can characterize an area of physics according to what we consider to be the relevant state which defines it, the rules which define transitions between states, and some physically relevant solutions to those rules. 

Second, this definition reveals that although different areas of physics are defined by different states, they are all unified by their desire to understand how these states evolve in time. Thus time is the only universal physical variable/parameter and we can therefore compare different areas of physics, not only according to the states and dynamics which define them but also according to how they treat time.

Areas of Physics: States, Dynamics, Kinematics


Electrodynamics
States: Particle positions, Electromagnetic fields, Electromagnetic Potentials
Dynamics: Lorentz Force Law, Maxwell’s Equations, Jefimenko’s Equations
(Important) Kinematics Examples: Coulomb’s Law, Dipole Radiation, Magnetic Field of of a Solenoid

Classical Mechanics and Special Relativity
States: Particle positions, Velocities, Rotation about an Axis
Dynamics: Newton’s Laws, Newton’s Law of Gravitation, Euler-Lagrange Equations, Hamilton’s Equations: Or (with relativity) the corresponding relativistic versions (if they exist) of these dynamics.
(Important) Kinematics Examples: Elliptical orbit of a planetary object, Projectile Motion, Simple Harmonic Motion, Precession/Nutation of a Top, Rocket motion, Relativistic Harmonic Oscillator

Quantum Physics
States: “Vectors” in Hilbert Space expressed in various bases (e.g., position, angle, spin-up/down); For Quantum Mechanics states can be defined by positions, spins, angles, and energy. For Quantum Field Theory states are the eigenkets of the Hamiltonians for various fields. 
Dynamics: Schrödinger Equation, Measurement Evolution
(Important) Kinematics Examples: Rabi Oscillations, Fermi’s Golden Rule, LSZ reduction formula

Thermodynamics and (Equilibrium) Statistical Mechanics/Physics
States: Macroscopic Variables (e.g., energy, magnetization, pressure, volume, number of correct element); Microscopic Variables (e.g., position, momentum, spin, permutation)
Dynamics: Associated Laws of Classical Physics, or (by virtue of Ergodic Theorem) Dynamics are irrelevant/encoded into state space 
(Important) Kinematics Examples: None because time is made irrelevant. 

(Non-equilibrium) Statistical Mechanics 
 States: Macroscopic Variables (e.g., energy, magnetization, pressure, volume, number of correct element); Microscopic Variables (e.g., position, momentum, spin, permutation)
Dynamics: Associated Laws of Classical Physics, or Master-Equation and its variants
(Important) Kinematics Examples: Solution to Diffusion Equation, Kinetic Ising Model, Solution to simple two-state process

General Relativity
States: Particle Position, Metric
Dynamics: Geodesic Equation, Einstein’s Equations
(Important) Kinematics Examples: Gravitational Lensing/Light in a gravitational field, Precession of Mercury orbit, Gravitational Waves from Binary Black Holes/Planets, Schwarzchild Solution, 


Treatment of Time in Various Areas of Physics
Classical Mechanics (sans Relativity)
- Time is a parameter. It is absolute, crystalline, and unchanging. 

Electrodynamics
- Time is a parameter akin to its role in classical mechanics. However, since some solutions to Maxwell’s equations involve the propagation of waves, time must be incorporated in such a way as to preserve causality (i.e., that the speed of light is the fundamental speed limit to causal signal travel)

Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics
Time is not relevant. Studying the evolution of microscopic variables in time is too complicated so we study their time average values. The ergodic theorem allows us to replace these time averages with ensemble averages. (You can think of it as a probability weighted configuration space) 
Non Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics
Time is a parameter used in the Master Equation or equations like it

Relativity
Time is not merely just a parameter; it becomes a function of proper time, and just as particle’s can be defined according to their positions, they can also be defined according to their times as such times are compared to the times in an inertial coordinate system.

Quantum Mechanics
Time is a parameter and comes into the Schrödinger Equation to define state evolution. The time of measurement is important for knowing when a wave function collapses.
In quantum field theory, time appears as a space-time parameter for field operators but is generally unimportant as a characteristic of states since we typically only consider states in the asymptotically far future or past.

We assume that the events 1, 2, 3 are mutually spacelike-separated. Suppose that there does not
exist a frame in which all three events 1, 2, 3 are simultaneous. Then if they occur in a particular order 123 in Alice’s frame, and if we consider a smooth sequence of Lorentz frames, then eventually two of the events will become simultaneous and then switch chronological order—without any real loss of generality, we can assume they’re 2 and 3, so that the frame sees the chronological order 132—and then 1 will become simultaneous with 3 and then switch chronological order with it—the order is then 312—and then ﬁnally 1 will become simultaneous with 2 and then switch chronological order with it—and thus the ﬁnal order is 321. This ﬁnal frame is Bob’s frame, and the second frame we mentioned is the frame we seek for Charlotte.

What is the relationship between justice and education? Ultimately I think it comes down to what we value and what we are willing to sacrifice for these values.

Multiple Supersymmetry Breaking and Dark Matter

Physicists like to believe that with the development of the standard model, we benefited from a great leap in understanding of the physical universe. In reality the standard model represents only about X% of the interactions and particles which make up our universe. The XX% consists of dark energy, which we don’t really understand and dark matter which we also don’t understand. 

If we eventually develop an understanding of dark matter the associated model would inevitably be encompassed by some theory which exists beyond the standard model. There are many famous possible/candidate theories in this direction, but many of them employ an assumption termed supersymmetry.

Particles in the universe are can be categorized as either bosons or fermions depending on their properties (specifically, dependent on a property termed “spin”). Fermions largely make up the stable matter we see around us. For example, electrons and quarks are fermions. Bosons on the other hand mediate interactions between these matter particles. In our current model of particle physics, the particles which mediate the electromagnetic and nuclear interactions and the interactions responsible for radioactive decay and the particle masses are all bosons. 


 and are associated with electromagnetic and nuclear forces and the forces responsible for radioactive decay and the development of mass 


in Bosons in general 

Supersymmetry defines a class of physical models where for each boson in the universe there is a corresponding fermion which has the same mass as that fermion and very similar interactions. Thus, if our universe was supersymmetric we should expect, for example, there to be a boson with the same mass and electromagnetic interaction properties as the electron. 

The fact that there is no such boson suggests that if supersymmetry is indeed a physical symmetry of the universe, it is not physically manifest in the particles which make up that universe. When a physical symmetry in a model is not physically manifest in the particle properties of the model, physicists say that the symmetry is broken. So if supersymmetry is a true symmetry of nature, it must be a broken symmetry. 

Now there are various ways a symmetry can be broken

Physicists take supersymmetry to be a convenient assumption in models of particle physics, because it solves some theoretical problems in the standard model physics. But if supersymmetry is to be a true symmetry of the universe, it is clear it is not physically manifest in our current universe and it is therefore broken. 

 and the symmetry of the theory makes it easier to analyze. 

If you break the symmetry

Indeterminacy and Interactions Intro

Quantum Field Theory is a nominally difficult subject due to the levels of abstraction needed to engage with it. First, it is often considered as a combination/medley of quantum mechanics and special relativity two subjects which are themselves intrinsically non-intuitive. Quantum Mechanics is non-intuitive in a space apart from classical physics, in that it makes our standard intuition of how particles should move and interact obsolete. Special Relativity is non-intuitive specifically because of how it changes/manipulates/modified our understanding of time. Quantum Field Theory combines these two subjects and although the questions it asks are distinct from the questions asked by either Special Relativity or Quantum Mechanics, the foundational premises which underly these questions are shared among its subsidiary subjects. The phenomenological results are interesting new results like zero-point vacuum energy, renormalization group theory, renormalization, quantum anomalies 

One idea/assumption is that these results are unique to quantum field theory, but this is far from the truth. One fundamental aspect of combining special relativity and quantum mechanics is that 

Special relativity leads to the lorentz covariance or invariance of physical quantities and thus acts as a constraint on the possible lagrangians we can write down. Quantum mechanics leads to particle states interacting in ways which are not predicted in classical mechanics. There is a fundamental indeterminacy in quantum mechanics (alternatively identified by uncertainty principles or the substitution of waves for particle pictures) and this indeterminacy leads to interactions which are not possible in the deterministic system. 

This basic fact is fundamental to many areas in physics and it could be a useful starting point in getting students to recognize how a possibly difficult subject like quantum field theory contains physical features/results/implications that they have seen elsewhere or which they can at least already understand. 

We present this perspective by considering a toy example of how new interactions can arise in originally deterministic systems when we make the existing interactions probabilistic. We show how our discussion leads to a conceptually simple (and non-quantum mechanical) derivation of a path integral, and we connect our discussion to ideas which are more physically grounded. 



One of the fundamental results 



One of the strangest things about quantum physics is that interactions which are not present in a classical system appear in the corresponding quantum system. A canonical example is the quantum harmonic oscillator which yields a non-zero probability for the oscillating particle to travel beyond the regimes seemingly demanded by energy conservation. Another example is in quantum field theory, where one sees that a field theory with only a finite number of interaction terms at a classical level can have infinitely many interactions at a quantum level. 

But the general idea that new phenomena appear in probabilistic system extends beyond quantum physics. For example, spin glasses exhibit disorder in the site-to-site interactions between spins and thus lead to new spin phases not present in Ising systems with definite interactions. 

This basic fact is fundamental to many areas in physics and it could be a useful starting point in getting students to recognize how an advanced subject like quantum field theory contains themes they can already understand. 

Indeed, the relationship between indeterminacy and interactions is so ubiquitous throughout physics that—much like the relationship between geometry and energy, or between symmetry and conservation laws—it deserves early mention in the physics curriculum. This may seem difficult if one has to wait until enough mathematics and physics is learned in order to discuss the idea through quantum field theory or even quantum mechanics. But it’s possible to encapsulate the essence of the relationship between indeterminacy and interactions in simple models with little physical or mathematical abstraction. 
Through such simple models, students can recognize how an advanced subject like quantum field theory contains themes they can already understand. 

In section II, we consider a toy example (which uses single-variable calculus, basic ideas in probability, and no physics) to show how new interactions can arise in originally deterministic systems when we make existing interactions probabilistic. In section III, we extend the mathematics of our discussion to develop a conceptually simple (and non-quantum mechanical) derivation of a path integral. In section IV, we finally ground the discussion in physics by giving examples of interactions induced by indeterminacy in quantum and statistical physics. 


it appears in the study of polymer chains and explains how these chains can have effective forces even though there are no interactions between chain links. Indeed

The indeterminacy in these systems is often encapsulated by computing physical quantities through a summation over states which, from a deterministic framing, would not contribute to the associated quantity. We saw this in the previous section in our summation over Belle’s position states; the spectrum of position states only became relevant when we imbued Belle’s position with probabilistic properties.

Feelings 
Do you think failing to say it makes it any less true? A name has been added to the list. A list riddled with the question of whether the loss is great enough to make the experience not worth it. Falling and falling all over again and the more times I fall the more I believe I will never fall again, until at last I do. They say being in it is better than not being able too feel it at all. I do not know if this is true, but I know I am bewildered by my vulnerability, and I cannot help but feel compelled to try to escape it. In the past, this compulsion has caused me to do drastic things, and I fear I have not matured in proportion to my aging. I’m still a child who sees rejection everywhere and tries to preempt its fruition by meeting it where it hides. What is the endgame, the outcome when either I or he has moved on? Eventually our conversations will stop, replaced by the intermittent conversations of another or simple silence. My feelings for him will never completely fade, and visions of him will haunt my dreams and fantasies, but the pain whose zenith I have yet to climb will be incorporated into the landscape, a feature in the distance, no longer looming so large, no longer threatening to destroy me. At the end I would not have been saved, only released from the emotional hysteria of the present. Will I again believe hope for a similar or better future is lost? Will I again succumb to a passivity justified by a refusal to move beyond bitterness? Will I ever try again?

Quantum Field Theory, a notoriously difficult topic, can be made pedestrian or connectable by relating it to simpler mathematical constructions that those of a pubescent grade levels prior to college can interpretationally understand. 

The complexity of subjects like quantum field theory and statistical physics mechanics 

Renormalization is an advanced topic in quantum field theory and statistical physics which has as its root the idea that non-deterministic systems exhibit phenomena and interactions not found in their corresponding deterministic analogs. This idea exists as one of the foundational themes of 21st century physics and thus interested students should not have to wait to take graduate courses before they are exposed to it.  With the example presented in this paper, students have the opportunity to learn the essence of the idea without the mathematical or physical pre-requisites typically required to do so. 

The purpose of this paper was to present the essence of this idea in a mathematically simple context 

This paper exists in the educational tradition of presenting advanced field theoretical ideas in mathematically or physically simple contexts. \cite{tarrach}\cite{griffithsho}\cite{delamotte}\cite{bhattacharjee}. However, many of the existing papers in this vein require extensive mathematical development and a familiarity with differential equations and integral calculus on the level of a student who is already taking a course in quantum field theory. They thus fail to achieve the purpose of presenting important field theory ideas to students even well before they have the mathematical background to understand these ideas in their formal context. 

to understand the underlying idea  Many of these papers present examples in this vein, but the the mathematical development necessary to understand these works is still somewhat high requiring flexibility with differential equations or integral calculus. 

Ordered chains (such as chains of nucleotides or amino acids) are ubiquitous in biological cells, and these chains perform specific functions and have important stability properties according to the precise sequence of their components. Using the existence and general properties of such sequences as theoretical motivations, we consider a statistical model of ``thermally distributed permutations" where there is a single lowest energy ordering for a sequence and each permutation of that ordering results in an energy cost for the system. 

The model is simple, but its combinatorics allow us to derive an interesting relationship between probability predictions, the partition function, and a linear combination of various moments of the system. These combinatorics also allow us to associate a partial differential equation to any discrete permutation model with an energy function of finite polynomial order. The derived PDE seems to describe a physical system distinct from that of the discrete partition function, and the PDE also seems to have a relationship to the original partition function analogous to the relationship between the wave equation and the equations of motion for many coupled oscillators.  

\section{Motivation}

Chains of compounds, molecules, and atoms are fundamental components of biological cells. For such chains the specific ordering of the constituent components is often fundamental to the resulting function and stability of the final chain such that if deviations from the correct ordering occur, the final chain can fail to perform its requisite function within the cell, proving fatal to the organism. 

We see the relevance of correct ordering in the study of protein structure. While the protein folding problem concerns finding the three-dimensional structure associated with a given protein sequence, the protein design problem, also termed the inverse-folding problem, concerns finding the correct amino acid sequence associated with a given protein structure (CITATION). In certain manifestations of this problem, specifically those termed random heteropolymer models (CITATIONS CITAITIONS), the correct amino acid sequence is found by implementing a Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm in sequence space given the assumption that amino acid composition is fixed. This entails assuming the number of various types of amino acids does not change, and distinct states in sequence space are permutations of one another.

This aspect of the protein design problem has alerted us to a gap in the statistical mechanics literature. Namely, there do not seem to be any simple and analytically soluble statistical mechanics models where the space of states is defined by permutations of a list of components. In such a model we could associate a schematic energy picture with the space of states as shown in Fig. 

From this fact it is reasonable to associate a potential energy picture with the space of sequences. For example, if we had a specific sequence of compounds which was the correct sequence for a particular biological function and was consequently ``stable" within the cell and from a biological perspective, then deviations from this sequence would be less stable. Schematically we represent the relationship between stability and ordering of molecular sequences in \reffig{en_landscape}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{en_landscape.png}
	\caption{Energy landscape of sequences: We consider a space of sequences of four elements. The horizontal axis associates a position on the axis with a particular order of the elements, and the curve shows how the potential  (thermodynamic in this work, but possibly otherwise) of the sequence varies according to the sequence label, and, thus, the ordering of the elements. There is a "correct" sequence at the lowest potential. A physical motivation for this picture lies in the fact the exact sequence of compounds in a macromolecular chain can determine the hydrophobicity of the resulting macrostructure and can thus affect the structure's stability.}
\label{fig:en_landscape}
\end{figure}

In this picture various permutations of an existing sequence correspond to various energies of a thermodynamic potential. Because of the role sequences of molecules play in biological systems, it is worth asking what general statistical properties might we expect such sequences to have from the perspective of statistical mechanics.

Biological systems are inherently out of equilibrium systems and thus it is generally incorrect to consider any such system from the perspective of equilibrium statistical mechanics. However, as a starting point for analyzing such systems with clear statistical physics properties, it proves useful to begin considering them from the analytically transparent framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics simply in order to lay the groundwork for future, possibly more relevant, non-equilibrium investigations. Especially useful to consider is whether the statistical physics representation of such biological systems bear, from a theoretical perspective any interesting phenomenological or mathematical properties. 

In this work, we investigate this question by positing a theoretical system of ``thermally distributed permutations" and working out some basic physical consequences of the system. We label our system in this way because the probability to be in a particular permutation is defined by the thermodynamics of the canonical ensemble. We show through a toy model that it's possible for such a system to exhibit second order phase transitions where the correct sequence becomes energetically disfavored above a certain temperature. 

We should mention our model differs from ones which may be more relevant in biology in three important ways: we are investigating the equilibrium rather than non-equilibrium properties of the sequence space; we assume unique components only occur once in the chain (i.e., no repeated components); we assume we already know the lowest energy ordering of components.

New Introduction for Thermal Permutations

The LinkedIn Message
I weary of the borderline passive and mostly noncommittal appeals that pass for reconnection these days. You haven’t heard from someone for years, perhaps even close to a decade, and even when they were a daily or intermittent presence in your life you were never good enough friends with them to share anything resembling a conversation. Then all of a sudden they appear in your life in that apparition-like way people can appear places these days. That is they do not come in as a physical presence, but they come in as a message, itself indirect because the message has no words but simply the formulaic request for contact dictated by the social networking site you two share. 

Hi Mobolaji, I'd like to join your LinkedIn network.

First, it’s lazy. The canned message indicates that there is likely nothing substantial behind the request. It has the guise of a request for connection, but true connection requires the conveyance of something personal, something which is not merely traded, but shared between two people. It would be simple enough to add a personal message to the default one, something to remind the person that you see them as more than just a name and an image. But hardly anyone sends such personal queries, and so I usually assume there is no deliberate intent behind the queries they do send.

In fact, I imagine the person sitting at their screen, clicking through profile after profile sending requests for connection to those they want and skipping the rest. You may be part of the chosen few, but you are simply one of many, your importance diluted by the scattered attention of a mind only tuned to quantity and status. 

Their entreaty means little to them, and I suppose they assume it means similarly little to you. The bar is low, emotional commitment at a minimum and thus such requests can be done often, released just as regularly and just as ephemerally as breaths of air. And it seems to me this act and so many others like it contribute deeply to the alienation and loneliness people so constantly feel. The times when our communities seem sparse and totally unpopulated with people who know us, the moments, almost always in the silence and darkness of a night alone in bed, when we wonder if there is any meaning to what we did during the day. It is the way we throw away the seemingly ever present opportunities for connection. With the barriers to communication now so reduced, almost everyone we have ever known is easily accessible, easy to catch up with, and in some perverse manifestation of economics in the social sphere we naturally devalue those connections and consequently strip them of much of the substance they can add to our lives. 

This is to say our attempts at personal connections are despairingly impersonal and ever more so because there is a deep symmetry at work here: The impersonal entreaty they use to contact you will be of the same kind as the impersonal silence they use when they no longer wish to have contact. Stripes and a tail revealing the tiger hidden in the bush. Because this is what people do, right? In this 21st century, we live in a world of implication where the distances over which we communicate make it possible for, and almost even incentivizes, people to never be clear about their intentions or their lack of them. The medium determines the message and our mediums constantly tell us that the messages we do not reply to, are just as well the ones we did not see, or more accurately did not take the time to see. Here’s the universal scenario:

Person A wants X from Person B. Person A contacts Person B asking for X. Person B has no desire to give X to Person A. Person B never responds to Person A.

The process is grounded in a familiar power dynamic. The person who cares the least has most of the power. The person who wants something is at the mercy of the person who doesn’t want anything at all. 

To say this is new is not accurate. Before unanswered email messages, texts, and friend requests, there were unanswered phone calls, unanswered mail, and even unanswered greetings in the street, the averted glance from someone within talking-distance to indicate that there was nothing worth talking about. 

So, perhaps the fundamental act, exists in the final one. For me, the in-person aversion was always the most painful, and it has always astounded me how quickly and easily one could feel erased, seemingly made irrelevant to the world and all its machinations, simply by walking by someone who refused to look at you. Nothing about our technology will take that away, nothing will force someone who does not want to connect with you to connect you, nothing will make the pain of that refusal any less. 

But I believe I can anticipate it before it happens. The cavalier majority who use the existing communication mediums without question, without actively interrogating how these mediums are changing the way they connect or do not connect with people, are the very same people who will take advantage of these mediums to create silence where it is convenient to them and vexing to others. I have usually tried to use an abstract principle of kindness when dealing with such people, treating them the way I proverbially would want to be treated. But this has just led to people not upholding their side of this implicit bargain, and has also led to me being entirely complicit in their abnegations. I have allowed others to treat me not at all the way I want to be treated, believing there was something moralistic in such allowance. I’m walking away from that now. Instead of treating people the way I want to be treated, I will treat them the way their own actions, by the golden rule, suggest they want to be treated. 

[//]

We throw away most opportunities for legitimate connection because those opportunities seem so ever present as to not be worthy of appreciation, and consequently we strip these connections of much of the significance they can have in our lives. 

What annoys me, I think, is that there does not seem to be anything substantial behind it. They do not really want to connect with you, they only want to add your name and image to their existing network. If they wanted to connect with you they would have sent a message more personal than the one simply provided them. 







Saturn’s Rings

Physical laws are so robust that even when these laws are used approximately, they can still yield correct results. Specifically, even without any of the precise mathematical machinery ordinarily used to express them, physical laws can be applied to problems through a combination of heuristics, rough estimates, and idealizations all of which are collectively termed “back of the envelope” calculations. The idea is that the calculation should be short and simple enough that it could be done on the back of an envelope, and it should also act as a rough model or a more rigorous calculation, in addition to yielding results consistent with it.

In this problem we answer the question of whether Saturn’s Rings are uniform in two ways. First, using a back of the envelope calculation, and second using a calculation relying on a precise accounting of the geometry of the situation.

Scale and Dimensions

That physical results depend on the dimensions they’re calculated in is something one does not absolutely recognize in their understanding of the physical universe until that understanding is reflected in a problem  concerning the dimensional realization of the problem format just stated. 

An important result in quantum field theory is that the high energy properties of a theory depend on the dimensions of space of that theory. For example, certain theories are only renormalizable in certain dimensions. 

That the physics of a system depends on its dimensions is something we see in electromagnetism. Coulomb’s Law expressed in two dimensions yields an inverse logarithmic potential, rather than a 1/r potential. 

In this problem we explore the relevance of dimensions by solving a problem in an arbitrary number of dimensions and connecting the result to the solution in both 1 and 3 dimensions. 

Although our physical world (apparently) is one with three spatial dimensions and one time dimension, there are many physical situations and problems where it's useful to relax this assumption. In such situations we find that many of the results we see as fundamental to our physical universe are only true within our 3+1 dimensional spacetime. For example, the $1/r$ electrostatic potential in our three-dimensional world, becomes a logarithmic function in flatland. More abstractly, in quantum field theory we find that the perturbative properties of a field theory depend on the dimensions of spacetime in which we study the theory. 

We consider a momentum transfer problem in one, three, and then an arbitrary number of dimensions. The goal is to give an intuitive (although mathematical) example of how a physical result can change when we change the number of spatial dimensions of our system.

Reasoning Mind Data Analysis

Reasoning Mind (https://www.reasoningmind.org/) is a non-profit organization based in Houston which takes early math education curricula developed in Russian schools and adapts them into e-learning software for American students. One major theme in the curriculum is continuously presenting previously learned concepts in new contexts and as new material is learned, rather than through repeated and atomized drilling. 

From the spring to the summer of 2015, I analyzed the 2013-14 data of Reasoning Mind’s Genie 3 platform (the existing rollout of their software) for the 6th and 7th grade curriculum.  The work consisted of parsing through gigabytes of their curriculum data and developing statistical analysis code to answer questions like
— What was average performance trajectory for all students throughout the curriculum?
— How often did students run out of time in answering questions?
— Did the student’s perspective on knowledge (e.g., Carol Dweck’s conception of fixed vs. flexible mindset) correlate with their performance? Did their performance affect their mindset?
— Did teacher engagement with the curriculum affect student performance?

This work was completed under Victor Kostyuk’s supervision.

Data Science of Video Game Reviews: Final Project of CS209 - Introduction to Data Science 
(http://ac209.weebly.com/)  

In the fall of 2014, prompted by the then ongoing Gamergate controversy, I was curious to see how geographic trends in American video game usage (i.e., what types of games were most often played in what parts of the country) correlated with the types of reactions to the claims of sexism in video game culture. 

I still think this is an interesting question, but it proved to be too large to answer, so Aaron Meisner and I ended up focusing our work on something much smaller. We developed statistical measures to define and identify low-hanging fruit in game development (areas where there was little competition from other game developers, low quality games, and high user interest in games) and a classification scheme which predicted the review score of a video game according to the short text used to advertise it on GameSpot.

Dysonian Redux: When Freeman Dyson came to the U.S. in 1945 to study physics after studying mathematics in the U.K., he worked at Cornell under Hans Bethe. One of the first problems Bethe asked Dyson to solve was the Lamb Shift in a theory of scalar electrodynamics. Dyson solved the problem using the old quantum theory of the 1930s. These notes update the calculation using the modern methods of quantum field theory. 

Understanding Symmetry Factors: Symmetry factors are arguably both a trivial and necessary aspect of calculations in quantum field theory. They had confused me for years, so I created these notes as a way to explain them. The notes use a simple toy model of quantum field theory to review how to correctly choose symmetry factors in the functional integral expansion of a QFT.

Quantum Mechanics of Hydrocarbon Chains: Final Project for MIT’s 8.322 course. The “infinite potential well problem” is arguably the simplest bound-state problem in quantum mechanics, and as such is not assumed to have much physical relevance. But such a problem actually well models hydrocarbon chains which have electrons which can (mostly) freely propagate along the (mostly) one-dimensional extent of the chain while being confined within the chain’s extent. In these notes we discussed some basic quantum predictions of assuming the system can be modeled by a infinite potential well. The discussion was grounded in Basdevant’s corresponding problem in his Problems in Quantum Mechanics text. 

Dimensional Analysis as a Guide to Perturbation Theory: Final project for MIT’s 8.012 course. The project sought to provide a numerical justification for using dimensional arguments to estimate the order of magnitude of perturbative results in a certain problem in quantum mechanics.

Long Distance Ultra-Relativistic Rocket Travel
You found that the velocity as a function of mass curve for the relativistic rocket has a larger average value when one assumes mass is conserved rather than relativistic energy. Ultimately which condition we choose comes down (I think) to what is the fuel-to-mass conversion process. But beyond this, determining whether your results are viable from an engineering standpoint involves answering two questions:
Does the higher V(M) curve for mass conservation imply longer distance traveled for the same amount of mass? This would require knowing something about dM/dt
Is it even possible to have a rocket achieve relativistic speeds if it’s fuel conversion process is non-relativistic?

Loop Corrections and Economic Collapse
When I was compiling the notes on indeterminacy and interactions, it became clear that the idea that things that ``aren't supposed to happen" in a deterministic system can indeed happen when that deterministic system is made probabilistic. Economic collapse isn't something which is ``supposed to happen" according to the standard functioning of the economy but it happens now and then. The purpose of this project is to explore whether it's possible to create a statistical theoretic model (which employs the intuition of qft) which shows economic collapse can proceed through indeterministic interactions (i.e., the loop interactions of QFT). 

You'll need to answer a few questions before you can begin any substantial work on the project
- What defines economic collapse? Low employment? Hyperinflation? What would be the best metric to model?
What are the main fields, variables, or general quantities you should consider for this problem? 
- You previously developed a model of inflation. Can it be made at all relevant to this problem? 

According to Google scholar
a book which apparently answers/tries to answer your question is Didier’s Why Stock Markets Crash. I know it uses quantum field theory because it references Weinberg’s Quantum Theory of Fields.  

Stokes Theorem and Quantum Field Theory
An old dream of mine is to find a Stoke's theorem manifestation of gaussian integrals and to later extend the theorem to functional integrals. Here are some rough step I'd need to complete beforehand. Of course these steps will change when I learn more about what I'm doing

Game Theory, Master Equation, and Evolutionary Dynamics
The idea is that the evolution of the ordering of a sequence is dependent on the strategy associated with sequence. The evolution is dependent on the strategy because the fitness of the sequence (which determines the time-evolution) is dependent on the strategy. 
 
Our system is defined by a space of sequences each of which consists of a particular permutation of a set number of components. An individual in the system is associated with a particular sequence, and the evolutionary strategy the individual adopts is contingent on that sequence. The strategies of all individuals compete against each other to define a fitness function for each individual. This fitness function is dependent on the strategies of all other individuals in the system. Thus the evolution of the space of sequences adopted by individuals in the population is contingent on this fitness function. 


Brainstormed list of requirements: 

Definition of space of sequences; a consistent way to account for the spectrum of sequences
A population of individuals each of which corresponds to a particular sequence (or a population which is less than the number of possible sequences)
A definition of games and strategies which is easily analytically manipulable. (as defined somewhat according to our spectrum of sequences)
Way to consistently associated a sequence with a strategy
Way to compute fitness according to collection of strategies
Master Equation (or some derived evolution equation) which models how sequences (or the probability to be in a particular sequence) evolves in time.

Entropy, Search Strategies, and Simulated Annealing
From Tsallis’s paper, it seems that it is possible to relate entropies to simulated annealing searches. Thus I want to see if it’s possible to devise a search algorithm based on the Renyi Entropy. And from my notes on understanding entropy, it seems that it’s possible to connect list-sorting strategies with various entropy definitions. So I’m wondering if it’s possible to unite all three?

Developing some algorithm for Renyi Annealing is probably the first step.
Looking for other definitions of entropy is perhaps the next step, along with finding out if they can be represented as annealing methods
Listing possible list sorting algorithms and seeing if they can be related to entropy definitions is perhaps the next step
I don’t even really know what the problem is.

Non-transitive selection: (Definition) strain A out-competes strain B; strain B out-competes strain C; but strain C out competes strain A
non-transitive selection makes it difficult to predict dynamics of three or more strains just from an understanding of how each pair interacts.

circumstances hidden from view. The choice is an apparition of one and you choose a path along a fork, believing the other path might have led you elsewhere when in fact the presence of the fork in your life dictated that both paths could only ever lead you to the same place. 

I too made this decision but I feel that I made it too late, believing erroneously that the world would wait for me as I was hesitating. But the world of course moved on and I am currently in the process of realizing that the ground upon which I was for so long so afraid to stand has now become marsh and is sinking beneath my feet. 

The part of me I cannot control, that two months ago I decided to listen to is now threatening to drown me as it submerges under floods it created. Because I have fallen in love with Tony and it is happening at a time when he is falling out of infatuation with me. This I think is what I was always afraid of. Not merely the intensity of my emotions, but also their consequences the recognition that the things I would feel could hurt me in ways that the person who induced these feelings had never intended. 

Like in some nightmare where one runs from a room to escape a demon only to find at the door of the next the demon waiting to devour you.

only to find in the new room the demon waiting jaws open and salivating to devour you. 

Like in some nightmare where in an attempt to escape a demon, you run from one room to another only to find in the new room the demon again waiting to devour you. 

There, too, is a denouement as constant as the surprisingly constant growth of new love: the decay of love too long denied. For all the people I have supposedly loved and loved in a way I had not ever anticipated when I first met them, the consequence has always been a drawing away, a shoring up of connection which placed me farther from them in trust and communion than with which we began. Fred, Stephan, and Jessica. Strangers, friends, and then strangers again, but upon their second return to being strangers the dynamics seemingly reach a fixed point and my mind recognizing their images and the tortures associated with them, refused any return to the hell it had once escaped. Attempts for reconnection, were met with apathy, the former love buried under weeks, then months, and years of attempts to rationalize pain. The love, of course, is still there, but it’s shouts cannot be heard when it resides far below the surface. 

So, I think with Tony the course has been set. Our relationship, short as it has been, is coming to its conclusion and if my personal history—one I may inaccurately believe I am bound by—provides any useful model, Tony will soon be added to the growing collection of memories which keep me mired in pessimism regarding the human condition.

Transcribed from short film Fired from Mars

Sooner or later, every man comes to a crossroads. Settle into comfortable mediocrity, or seek greatness, entering the wilderness of his own intuition. Unfortunately most are too blind to recognize opportunity when it knocks. Others recognize it only after it’s too late. And yet for some of us, the lucky few, that wake-up call simply cannot be ignored. We take the exit ramp, light out for the territory. Our sails full with a mix of rocket fuel and hell-fire. With new roads come new joys, also trials, like unpredictable rock storms, or carbon-monoxide breathing GMO monkeys in the canyon. But a gem can’t be polished without friction, so a man forges the tools that will sustain him on the road ahead, meticulously tending to the garden of his soul. And when it finally bears the fruits of his labor…well then he will finally know the satisfaction of being nobody but himself. A colony of one.

Tony, Part Whatever
I imagine the reason people hold onto their hate so strongly is because they realize once hate is gone, they will have to deal with pain. 
— James Baldwin

Months ago I realized that love could grow because like fulfillment it too was a function of time, and that the longer two people spend in each other’s presence the more they see of the other person, the more initial impressions melt away, the more the reality of the human being beyond caricatures and prejudices is seen. And one finds in these moments, that one is somewhat split in two, pulled in opposing directions one of which is who one used to be and the other of which is who one has the potential to become. Regardless of the choice one makes, both of these directions stay with one, albeit in a potentially reduced sense. Their reconciliation exists in how you honor the one you walk away from while you’re living the one you supposedly chose. Supposedly, because the choice is never really your own, but is a function of whatever route appears most livable at the time.

The two choices were to turn off my cell-phone or toss it out the window. The latter was a real possibility, for I had done it twice before both under similar circumstances which are now only vaguely recalled. The first instance was with Fred. I was waiting for him to call, either because he said he would or because I simply expected him to. In any case, he didn’t call and I lost my mind. I dismantled my phone and tossed it over the garage roof. The next instance was four years later. I was talking (or at least trying to talk) to Helen, and she was not responding to my texts. I was entering into that realm of conversations where you recognize you are the only person invested in keeping the interaction going. And this was dispiriting, and devastating because I had somehow convinced myself that Helen could save me, and here she was telling me, in all ways but the only explicit way, that she could not. 

It was not a good time for me. I was completing my thesis, and hating the process, and I needed to feel something real. For some reason, I had come to believe that Helen was this “something real” and I poured into her all my hopes and desires for sustenance, and I entered into a bargain, a deal with an apparition of who she was, an thus it was a deal that the real Helen could not fulfill. When it became clear that she would not text me back, or that she would constantly tell me “I’m busy,” or that simply the dream was dead, my mind was thrust months back to when Jessica was ignoring my texts. Minutes later, I had come to the edge of something that I have since then felt time and time again, and a vision flashed through my mind of me hanging from the ceiling by a rope, my feet loose and angled, arms dangling at my side. To escape the premonition, I entered a different one. I lived on the fourth floor of the Beacon house, and the roofdeck was down the hallway and up a flight of stairs. On the roofdeck, I felt the breeze of the air and a rush of adrenaline. I had made the decision to walk up here, but I had yet to make the decision to jump off. I thought of Helen, and I thought of Jessica, Stephanie, Katie, Lesley, Stephan, Elizabeth and I thought of the fact that I was still a virgin after three years of living in a fraternity and I thought about men, women, and children and simply people dying and suffering not merely a world away but at that very moment in the streets of Boston. And I knew that these social problems which were destroying me were small in the spectrum of human problems and yet I was still being destroyed, and with no will behind the motion but simply a force, so cosmic and ethereal in its intensity, like a man walking to the gallows, I walked to the fence separating the wooden planks of the deck from the 40 foot drop off below. But instead of climbing it I took my phone, that modern symbol of prosperity and connection and its antithetical lack, and I tossed it as far as I could. 

In both scenarios, my parents bought me a new phone. My parents neither of whom were really working at the time paid for my insanity in cash they took from their savings. 

And so, over the past week as I descended slowly and cyclically into depression like some infernal helix spiraling into the abyss, I tried my best to fight off any sense of history repeating itself. The last time I met Tony was two Fridays ago. I would say he was unusually distant but that would be a lie. He had been distant ever since I told him I liked him and the more I had tried to convey my feelings the more it seemed he drew away. On that Friday we watched Kubo of the Two Strings in the Common and then we drove to Harvard Square and ate burgers at Flat Patties. As a side comment to some conversational thread I can no longer remember, he told me he had found a job in Florida, and that he would be moving before the end of the month. I was shocked by this. When, I asked him, did you plan on telling me? Tonight, he said. I tried to take it in stride. I’ll miss you I said. He nodded at this. He didn’t say he would miss me back. 

The more I think about the past few nights I’ve spent with Tony, the more I realize I am enjoying being around him less and less. I tried watching The Way He Looks with him and he kept asking me when the sex scenes were going to happen. And his new found distance is infuriating. It is as if he decided to take two steps back simply because I decided to take two steps forward.

After we left Flat Patties we walked around Harvard Square. I was being emotional and serious like I can’t help being when I feel emotional and serious on the inside. I was trying to tell him how I felt about him, but the words “I like you” although true, felt weak, and I was no longer entirely sure what love was. “I really like you,” I said. “I know,” he said, or “Thank you,” or some throw away phrase which made me feel like he did not understand at all. And of course, how would he understand? He does not know who I am, he does not know that it’s been years since I said that to anybody. He does not know what those words mean to me. 

I sighed, and he, apparently frustrated, asked me what was wrong. “I’m trying to tell you how I feel, but I’m failing at it.” I said. It was melodramatic, I know, but it had been two weeks since I had seen him, and something was pouring out of me that I was struggling to control. “You’re not failing,” he told me, “I know you like me.”

He drove me back to Parkdale house, and we went up to my room. He laid on my bed and then immediately started playing Candy Crush. I laid next to him and pulled out my laptop, trying to mirror his distance because I thought it was just a prelude, an act for what would inevitably come next. Tired of pretending, I hugged him and kissed his cheek and he jocularly turned away. This went on for a few minutes before he announced that he would probably be leaving soon. He was, he explained, tired. I took this cooly. I hugged him good-bye and walked him to the door. As he drove away, I realized then what I am telling you now. This moment was part of a pattern that I had been ignoring because I was so focused on what was initially there. The warmth he showed at the beginning was gone and at that moment I finally entertained the possibility, with him leaving before the end of September, that it would not be coming back.

I had to escape Tony while it was still in my power to do so, and my myopia made me believe escape could be achieved through another guy. I would, I told myself, get what Tony denied me that Friday from someone else.

The guy’s name was Nathan and I texted him and went to his hotel within the span of five hours. Ever since I started dating, I had tacitly vowed to never be with a white person, believing that to them all I could ever be was a gimmick, an exotic foray to pass the time while they were looking for something truly worthy of them. But Nathan was certainly white, and I convinced myself that it did not matter because what I was going to do with him had nothing to do with status and pride, and that if it did come to pass that he was simply using me to throw me away, then this was fine because I was doing the same to him. 

But Nathan was not at all like that. He seemed to embody that word of condescension and flattery women bestow upon men who are overly nice and overly earnest: “sweet”. He was from Rhode Island, haling from a large family. He told me all about himself. He tried to connect with me. And all the time I was thinking of Tony, wishing I could some how escape him, escape both of them, escape this state that I had plunged myself into. “How badly do you want to fuck me?” he asked me lasciviously. Adverbs are typically weak, but this one is particularly appropriate. No one had ever asked me such a question. His words came out as a whisper, undoubtedly paralleling some fantasy known only to him. He even gave me a scale. “From 1 to 10, how bad do you want to fuck me?” he asked again. My honest answer would have been a 2, but I told him 8. I had no desire to put any appendage of mine into any part of his body. I didn’t want to do this. But I had told myself I needed to do this. This, I had somehow convinced myself, was what I needed to do to be rid of Tony. And I needed to be rid of him, because the night before I had realized how tightly and unconsciously he had attached himself to my life. 

Kneeling above Nathan his legs splayed and him waiting, thoughts of Tony came unimpeded. I tried to focus. I was trying to save myself. I needed to do this to save myself. I put the condom onto my flaccid penis which only grew softer by the second. Nathan waited. “One second,” I said. It was a dishonest appeal. Nothing would be happening that night, and instead of trying to start a dead motor my mind was trying to chart my body’s escape. Finding no way out, I capitulated. “I’m sorry,” I told him. “This has never happened before,” which was of course true because I have never tried this before, but in retrospect the statement could not at all be comforting to Nathan for it suggested the problem was not with me but with him. He said it was OK. I told him I was nervous. He said this was endearing; he was nervous too. We could still cuddle, he offered. I accepted this. And this was when he told me about his family and his aunt with cancer and his cousin and how small Rhode Island was and how he constantly met people who knew his family and ostensibly knew him because they knew someone who shared his last name, Keough. It despairs me to say I tolerated this conversation. I had always fancied myself the victim, the one upon whom gratuitous insult was always inflicted rather than the one doing the insulting. But there I lay spooning a man, who was naked (not merely in body) before me, who was telling me about his life, telling it to me like I was someone who could be trusted, and I only gave him hollow smiles all the while wishing that he would stop so I could leave. 

As I got dressed he asked if I liked to go on dates. Things like getting dinner or going to a restaurant. Yes, I said. I would like that very much. I kissed him good night and he walked me to the lobby and out the front doors. A day later he texted me asking if I was free to hangout that week (which was this week). I told him I was busy—that deceitfully innocuous word which so incensed me when women threw it at me. He said OK, and that I should text him when I’m free. 

I have not texted him nor do I plan to.

The outcome is that I am becoming a terrible person. When you feel that the world has mistreated you, one too many times, you begin to take it as an operating principle that the world is not fair and you thus need no longer pretend that it is. You soon begin taking liberties in areas of morality which were previously non-negotiable. Lies, betrayals, cheating. They grow in frequency until they change from aberrations in character to foundations of personality. You slip often enough into the mud, you soon forget that you are not supposed to stay there.

But it is interesting to observe oneself transform from victim to perpetrator. Imagining the transformation in the past, I had always believed it would come with a greater weight of agency, a greater potency to act on the world—if only through destruction—rather than being acted upon by that world. And this is partly true: There is a great sense of power associated with anticipating pain by meeting its carrier first and striking before it recognizes you as a threat, but this power, as do all stolen privileges, comes too with a loss of meaning, for one is forced to acknowledge that a world which will allow you to hurt others and cause as much pain as you do without proportional consequence is a world which does not have and never did have any moral arc toward justice. 

In short, I am not kind and I am not good (I honestly do not know if I ever was), and any stories I create which attempt to deny these facts are simply tales selectively chosen to make my own pain seem greater, more important, more existentially trenchant than everyone else’s 

And what of my master plan? Had I rid myself of Tony? Not in the slightest, rather what I had experienced was the living embodiment of a simile. For like in some dark nightmare, I had tried to escape a demon by running from one room to another only to again find it waiting to devour me. 

But one good thing came from that night. I realized my feelings for Tony could not be washed out through some sensory experience, but would have to be dealt with squarely and sanely the way adults are supposed to deal with problems. 

With action having failed, I turned to patience. I waited for him to call and to explain what was wrong that night, what has been wrong for a month and a half. I wanted to see him, to be in his proximity again, but I wanted more to know what he thought of me, how he felt. All of our past outings had been initiated by me and I had finally realized he was going through the motions with these outings, present mostly in physical space alone. So I forced myself to wait. But I heard nothing from him for ten days. A time period I would not have even thought twice about months ago when I started seeing him, but which now seemed to expand intolerably in duration. And then, after those ten days, to save myself from the screeching silence of my phone and to stop my mind from turning and turning on the implications of that silence, I turned off my phone for 48 hours, and somewhere within that time he managed to text me. Now, it is moments like these where narcissism is not needed to believe that the universe is conspiring to make you crazy. The facts are laid bare and intelligent estimates of the probabilities associated with the events which threaten to destroy you make it difficult to absolutely claim that some hidden design is not at work.

Today is Tuesday (or actually Wednesday very early morning). I have texted him back, and I have called him. That was hours ago, and he has not called back. I must say I am OK with this. I must be. My plan to save myself from insanity did indeed work, for I am still conscious and no electronics have been irreparably disassembled. But I know my decisions have placed me at a place of new risk. I am on the verge of entering again into that dance of silence which led to this very moment. And if it occurs again, who is to say that the outcome will be the same?

I also recognize Tony has potentially been hurt by my silence. And yet, I am OK with this. In fact I anticipated it: I wanted to hurt Tony’s feelings. Now, how sadistic is that? I say that I am in love with him, but still I want to hurt him? Why? For one, because he has hurt me and like a child I want him to know how it feels, and for two, if he is hurt as I was hurt then it means he feels for me the way I feel for him. Revenge and affirmation with a single blow, a malicious efficiency.

But there is an even deeper pessimism at work here. I know that if Tony continues to act the way normal people act, like their connections with others are everlasting and thus unimportant, the intensity of my feelings for him will flame and flame until I am consumed and the fire will die and in its place will be a wall of ash. The wall will protect me and render Tony dead in my eyes. It is a future I see in front of me, and I feel myself being forced toward it as I have been forced toward it so many times before. And I think subconsciously I am daring Tony to do whatever it is he will do that will finally thrust me to this future, something that will make me distrust him so much that the love will bend into hate and although I will not be free from him (as I could perhaps never again be), I will at least no longer be vulnerable. 

There are people who upon discovering their love is a weight that is causing them to drown, will hold on tightly to that love believing that dying with it is better than living without it. And then there are others who measure differently and toss away the love in an attempt to save themselves. It seems, I am one of the latter.

- Sometimes our salvation does not come early enough. It misses us and we change never knowing how close we came to being saved.

- The outcome is that I am becoming a terrible person. When one feels that the world has mistreated one, one begins to take it as an operating principle that justice does not exist and one need not be beholden to its supposed ideals.

They grow in frequency until they change from aberrations in character to foundations of personality. You slip often enough into the mud, you soon forget that you are not supposed to stay there. 

- I think I was waiting for him to call, to explain what was wrong that night, what had happened. But he did not call, he did not text, for ten days after that Friday need not continue living like it is. 

September 8, 2016 — Thursday 5:34 AM
Waiting for Tony

Tony still hasn’t replied my text message. Or my call. I even called him again last night. The call rang about half a dozen times before going to voice mail. It is really strange expecting someone to do one thing and finding that they do another. It forces you to reevaluate the assumptions and calculations which went into the first expectation and to consider again the experiences you had thought were one thing, but which now are revealed to have contained dimensions then hidden to your perception. 

This calm, collected evaluative approach was not my initial reaction—in fact I cannot even claim that it is my reaction at the moment. Instead, I have become incensed. Hours from midnight, I gave Tony a time limit—whose meaning and intent was not clear because I never communicated it directly to him—that if he had not responded by the end of the night I would never speak to him again. Dramatic, I know, but besides trying to escape the allergic mental state waiting had driven me toward, the vow had its roots in my emotional history. It was a history riddled with rejections realized too late, hands which held doors open long after the visitor had decided never to return. I was, in short, trying to protect myself from humiliation. It had become clear that Tony, regardless of his feelings at the outset of our relationship, no longer cared about me enough to even give a timely response to my text messages. Returning again to that emotional history, I recognized that this seemingly innocuous failure was an indication of a deeper disregard and if I failed to heed the warning it provided I would soon find myself trying to cross a chasm whose bridge, dilapidated, forgotten, and no longer maintained, could not support my weight. 

Tony, my volition be damned, had been made a priority in my mind, while I no longer was a priority in his. Although I could not stop thinking about him, he seemed eminently capable of forgetting about me. Given the facts of our experiences this dichotomy is perhaps appropriate. He is the first person I have ever been with and so he looms large in my mind, towering above the ruins of failed friendships and desires un-realized. But, if the stories he has told me are true, I am just one person out of maybe half a dozen in his history. And so to save myself, I believed I needed to cut him from my life.

The scenarios played out variously in my head. Given that I would not seek him out again, perhaps that text message sent some time on Monday or Tuesday night would indeed be the last time I’d ever hear from him. Or maybe he would contact me, texting first, giving some excuse for his silence. “I was out of town.” “I was busy packing.” “I didn’t respond because I didn’t feel like it.” And then I would see the text, register its existence and try to file it away and not think again of him. After I failed to respond to the first query, he would probably call and text again, and then I would watch the phone ring and vibrate and I would struggle, mightily but successfully, against the urge to answer it. It would take an enormous willpower to achieve this, to make true in appearance what is certainly not true in my heart: that I too think of Tony only when I have to and that I am at last done feeling like I have to. 

I imagine he would try two or three more times before giving up, and it would take me weeks and months to understand what had happened between us. Actually, it most likely could never be understood, only variously parsed and interpreted through narratives focused on preserving my sanity rather than seeking the truth. Inevitably, there would be a darkening of perspective, a sense that the world was more bereft of hope and promise than even my previous pessimism allowed. Indeed it has already happened. A week ago as I was with Nathan, I recognized that I did not feel anything for him. He was new to me, an unknown quantity, someone with whom I had no history and thus no connection. But months ago, when I was in Tony’s home among his bed, his pyramid of cups, and his clothes, I had made the same assessment and had believed erroneously it was a permanent one. So it was my recent experience with Tony, which made me realize my current feelings for Nathan were not a conclusive statement of trajectory, but merely an initial condition. How I felt about him could bud and change and swell and, in a flash, I knew I could find myself as entwined with him as I was with  Tony. But it was the fact that I was so entangled with Tony and that I was suffocating under this entanglement, which drove me to Nathan in the first place. So in Nathan I saw a cyclic premonition of my possible history with him, something whose beginning and end were already represented in this night that we first met. And with this perspective I could not help seeing Nathan as though he were already far away, as though the troughs and hills I might cross with him had already been crossed and that he, rather than being a new prospect, was firmly, and likely bitterly, already placed in my past. 

But I think I have instead decided not to be so inflexible about this, to not be so predictable. For this indeed is my typical reaction to such a scenario: a shoring up of defenses in preparation for a long winter which I end up prematurely inducing when I am tired of waiting for it to come. Tony will respond to my text message and when he does I will not ignore it, I will not play the puerile games of status and conquest meant to save face, I will not pretend that I do not feel for him what I most certainly do. I will answer the text, and take the consequences as they come. 

But regardless of what happens from now on, my musings, all this writing, and all this thinking has tainted something between us, and our relationship now lacks the innocence and purity of motive that it had such a short time ago. I no longer have implicit faith in him. I will now forever interrogate his motivations, forever wonder how he really feels and whether I could trust him not to throw me away whenever he stops feeling whatever it is that he does. 

And there is something about this loss which was not at all inevitable. My thoughts changed and metastasized within the vacuum of a silence we both created. The problem, as is the canonical problem in many relationships, was communication. I did not know why it took him half a day to respond to my text message or why he no longer seemed interested in kissing me, and instead of asking him directly—because asking would reveal too much about how I cared and would make him cognizant of the power he had over me—I developed stories within the space of my ignorance. These were stories meant to protect myself from the eventual resolution of these ambiguities, which I knew in their most dangerous manifestations could surely break me. 

But he too was largely uncommunicative. Two weeks ago, when we walked around Harvard square, besides trying to clarify my feelings for him, I was hoping he would also clarify his feelings for me. By bringing up how I felt about him, how what I felt now was stronger and greater than it had been in the past, I had tried to create the conversational room for him to say something, anything, in return, but the opportunity was ignored and he instead spent much of our time together playing games on his phone. 

What surprises me about much of this experience over the past few months is that I did not anticipate it. I initially believed I was safe, never imagining I would feel what I currently do for Tony. Part of my blindness arose because Tony looks nothing at all like the standard depictions of attractive masculinity or more generally attractive men. He’s a slightly overweight, not particularly tall, southeast asian immigrant with a thick accent. And yet I have fallen in love with him. Years of indoctrination through advertisements meant to state and define what is beautiful could not prevent it, and so James Baldwin’s abiding insights on love seem to require an addendum: Not only can you not choose who you fall in love with, neither can your culture, its attempts notwithstanding, choose for you. 

The other source of my blindness was a too conclusive reading of my experiences with women and men. Each time I fell in love and descended and descended, un-caught, I would crash to the bottom and as I healed I would begin to believe I was undergoing an irreversible change which would make it impossible to fall again. It is what passed for maturity in my eyes, perhaps because, like one’s visions of maturity, it was a change I could never attain. No matter how often I fell, and was broken, I still seemed to retain the ability to fall again. I had realized this with Jessica, and in the years since had forgotten the lesson, but Tony has returned the knowledge to me.

Audre Lorde in “Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference”


“Certainly there are very real difference between us of race, age, and sex. But it is not those differences between us that are separating us. It is rather our refusal to recognize those differences, and to examine the distortions which result from our misnaming them and their effects upon human behavior and expectation.”

Lorde argues that many social movements, specifically the woman’s moli;vement, are stymied by a deliberate ignorance of the differences within the community, assumed to be an undifferentiated monolith, which supports the movement. For example, the idea that women who agree with the ideals of feminism exist in complete solidarity is false because women of different races, ages, classes, and sexual orientations experience the patriarchy differently, and often the way one part of the feminist culture responds to and opposes the patriarchy leads to oppression along another line of identity for a different part of the culture.

However, Lorde’s title is misleading as she spends a paragraph each discussing classism and ageism and spends much of the work discussing the potential racism of mainstream feminism and the potential heterosexism of black feminism. 

By a very superficial reading of her biography, this seems to be reflective of her own blindspots as although racism within the woman’s movement and heterosexism within the black woman’s movement adversely affect her, ageism and classism benefit her (she was 46 years old, and a Master’s degree holder when she wrote this piece). 

If I were being ungenerous I would say she used the stated title to give her work a credibility and generality the content did not have. But being more generous I would say she artfully is allowing her own work to reflect the source of the biases she’s criticizing. Everyone has cultural blind spots which render the oppression of other groups of people conveniently invisible, and the American civil rights work of the past 50 years could largely be reduced to exposing the blind spots of the white, heterosexist patriarchy. But these blind spots also exist within the movements which propelled civil rights work itself, and these blind spots are not recognize by the leaders of these movements because it is more efficient policy-wise, organization-wise, and identity wise to focus on one’s own victimization rather than the way one victimizes others. 

Moreover, people inevitably feel that their own pain is more important and deserves greater scrutiny than their privileges which are often not acknowledged and upon which even their pain is built.

Thoughts of Tony, again
Still nothing from Tony. I am beginning to believe he is ignoring me. This is a narcissistic explanation, right? Out of the spectrum of reasons for why he hasn’t contacted me, I choose the one which places the problem within me. A lost phone, a series of tired days, extreme busyness. It could be anything. 

But I know how this degree of possibility can also be used to sustain hope when it is no longer appropriate to do so. Occam’s razor exhibits its greatest utility in explaining to the unrequited why their loves seem ever absent, but you could fight these explanations and tell yourself all manner of lies to deny the fact that the one you’re interested in is simply not interested in you. 
For me, I fight this knowledge because I know that some time ago Tony was clearly interested, but of course this does not preclude the possibility that he no longer is. The need to fight is also tied to my need to sustain hope in the face of events which contest hope’s interpretation. 

But reader of the future, I don’t want you to consider me from too patronizing a lens. I don’t want you to think that I’m just sitting here waiting for him. I have been doing other things (attending AP50 and Phys 95, writing lecture notes, running, working out), it’s just that no matter what I have been doing I have been thinking about him. Thoughts of him have been the setting in which everything else has taken place. And after days of not hearing from him and recognizing that with all likelihood he is alive and well and simply living comfortably and peaceably without me, the anger and hurt is gradually fading away, as I too am learning to live without him, and in its place is growing a deep curiosity. What is he doing? How will this story end? Or if it does not end conclusively, on what cliff will I be left dangling wondering of the outcome? 

If I don’t hear from him again, I will construct all manner of explanations more reflective of my insecurity than anything else for why he has disappeared. If I hear from him weeks or months down the line, would the curiosity still be great enough to encourage a response? 

I am running out of material in this direction, and I’m sure you’re tired of reading about all the things I think of concerning a situation whose explanation is clear. Impatience is pushing me to a quick resolution. If he is indeed ignoring me, I can just call him using a different phone number, and on the oft chance that he is the kind of person who responds to phone numbers he does not recognize, the moment I hear his voice I would know that he has indeed been avoiding me. What then would I do with this knowledge?

Continuum Extrapolation of Thermal Permutations
I am at a roadblock with the permutations project. I’ve been here for much longer than I intended, much longer than I want to be here. I’m trying to show moments in the permutation model map to derivative operators when the model is extrapolated to the continuum regime. I feel I am close, to a full derivation, most of the pieces I believed I needed have been assembled and I only need to get connect two nodes in an already well-connected network of results. But I have been trying to connect these nodes for weeks and now I’m starting to question the utility of doing so.

My interest in the continuum extrapolation was grounded in the idea that it described some interesting physical system that I had just never before seen. The analogy motivating this idea was that in the same way the wave motion is the continuum limit of the dynamics of many coupled springs, this interesting and new physical system was the continuum limit of the model of thermal permutations. I believed that with time I would discover what this new physical system was, so I focused on working on the calculational details, but I have not been successful in completing either the analytic or large picture work. I have checked out an old book (The Umbral Calculus, by Steven Roman) which I hope will help me complete the analytic calculation so that at least something solid exists in this space of confusion.

Beyond the continuum extrapolation, I’m pursuing other other points in this work. The most immediate other point is developing a spin glass model of permutations. I’m going to start with a model which only has a linearly interacting term and then add the quadratic contribution. I also really want to try to develop a solid “Ising-like” interacting model for this system.  

My main obstacle for this last goal is that the problem is analytically much more difficult than the linear-interaction problem and my numerical studies of the energy level degeneracies hasn’t revealed any pattern. Which either means there is no pattern, or that my numerical studies are wrong. I’m going to assume the latter and repeat these studies. 

Finally, I also want to connect the work to larger topics in physics, and all of these connections are derived in some way from work done on the Ising model.  I want to construct a non-equilibrium model of thermal permutations, study it within the context of gauge symmetry, and simulated annealing optimization problems. Also, it is known that the Ising model in three dimensions can be mapped to the phi^4 model. I wonder then if it is possible to achieve a similar mapping with the permutation model? I have an ulterior motive in expanding the work in these directions: I hope doing so will give me enough material to write a thesis.

More generally, I wonder if this problem is too small, too specific and unrelated to the so-called important problems in science. As a vague motivation, I connected the problem to questions in protein design, but this certainly was not the original goal, and it is also not what has driven the new points of interest I’m pushing the project toward. I know it is a mistake to reduce a problem to some supposedly objective sense of what is worthy of investigating. It’s a mistake I have made many many times in the past, and it was only when I released myself from ideas of utility that my work was able to breathe and grow. But one could also argue it is the large questions, large in the philosophical intent at their source if not merely their scientific implications, which led me into physics in the first place. Perhaps, then a balance must be sought between the work which propels one’s curiosity in the day-to-day grind and the ideals to which that work aspires.

Saturday September 10 6:43 AM
Closure
I implemented the plan. I signed up for a google voice number with New York city’s area code and I called Tony. To my surprise it rang and rang and went to voice mail. So, if it is true that he is ignoring my calls, it seems he is also ignoring the calls of anonymous strangers. Afterward I sent him an email through the account he used to send me a letter he needed help editing. Maybe this seems a bit much. I know I am beginning to appear desperate, something I had worked so hard not to seem in all my past relationships. 

But, after exhausting all my options for contacting him, I think I’m now OK . As each day passes, the chances that I won’t hear from Tony again seem to grow and grow. It seems he is done with me. There is of course pain in this recognition and no small amount of self-righteousness. But in pursuit of my practice to look at life not exclusively for what it does not yet contain but also for what it already does, I am situating this pain in a holistic narrative. Because for whatever I think Tony might be taking away from me by disappearing in this way, he has given me so much more. Not only did he give me my first intimate experience with another person, he has taught me so many lessons about intimacy and friendship, the way the former should be conveyed rather than stifled by fear and the way the latter need not fall neatly into the lines of its typical definition. 

Tony always called me a friend, and although I associate that word with relationships totally different from my relationship with Tony, I’m willing to expand my sense of what constitutes friendship in order to see what possibilities it presents. Perhaps my own definition of friendship and the way I tried to live that definition explains much about why I feel somewhat disconnected from most of my “friends”, explains why when I contemplate never seeing them again, the predominate emotional response is apathy. I have never thought of this, but in the five months I’ve known Tony I think I’ve exposed more of my vulnerabilities to him than I had exposed to most of my pledge brothers throughout our time at MIT. Perhaps this is the reason I feel so close to him and the reason the prospect of him deciding he no longer cares to see or hear from me feels so painful. But I am glad that I had the experience of such exposure, that I did not hold so tightly onto my insecurities and fears that vulnerability was impossible. This willingness to present my vulnerabilities, to be honest about what I wanted and “who I was” is as much due to Tony’s influence as it is due to any summation of courage on my part. And Tony’s influence, no matter the outcome of our relationship, is something I know I am thankful for.

Jiwon
Yesterday, I showed Jiwon around Boston common and walked with her from the Esplanade to MIT. It was pretty cool. She’s from South Korea (but not Seoul), she has an older brother who works in/with LG, she has been in Boston/Cambridge since January. In AP 50 earlier this week, she told me she hadn’t seen some parts of Boston (places I thought were essential) since she’s been here, so I offered to show her around. I met up with her in front of Starbucks and proceeded to give her an extremely awkward hug which she was not expecting—I remember Courtney reacting the same way when I first tried to hug her—and then we were off. 

(Insert philosophical statement about the hopeful beginnings of love and the inevitable painful end of love and the need to appreciate moments in the moment and not merely for where you think they may lead)

Later in the day I went to dinner with Lily and Elana. I hadn’t seen either of them since the MFA trip. It was good seeing them. All in all a cool day.

Relativistic Harmonic Oscillator and Photons - Draft

The harmonic oscillator is such an ubiquitous system in physics that one particle physicist claimed that all of modern theoretical physics reduces to more and more abstract representations of the harmonic oscillator. While not true for all areas of theoretical physics, this statement has great validity in quantum field theory (QFT) and all the sub-fields of physics which use its methods. The canonical assumption of QFT is that fields at the quantum level can be represented as particles which are the excited modes of a quantum oscillator.

In demonstrate how this relationship between particle and oscillator is manifest in a classical, but relativistic, regime. This demonstration is situational and is not physically deep (as it contains no quantum mechanics) but it is conceptually gratifying to see that a decidedly advanced correspondence also exists at a simpler level. 

can be reduced to quantum oscillators so that particle 

The first quantum field theory was theoretically studied when Planck posited that electromagnetic radiation was composed of discrete oscillating degrees of freedom rather than continuous waves. From here the assumption that fields at the quantum level are represented by quantum oscillators became canon. 

Here we present a classical representation of this relationship

Stealing from Eric Mazur
I’ve been a part of AP50 for about a week and a half now, and I think I’m learning much about different assignments and tasks that can be added to a physics course. Currently their are two main things I want to steal for my own future courses.

Estimation Activity: In these activities students are given a largely ill-defined problem whose answer they’d need to find using order of magnitudes and approximations. Some of  the questions Eric has used so far are “What is the maximum acceleration for a sprinter during a 100 m dash?” or “What is the total distance traveled by all people who have ever lived on earth?” These are good skills, I think, for any physics subject with physical predictions. It probably wouldn’t work well, for example, in a course on the AdS/CFT correspondence or String theory, but should work pretty well in particle physics. 

Problem Structure: In assignments, Eric requires students to not simply write out a solution but to discuss the problem generally, determine a plan for answering it, and then after writing out a solution, reflecting on the result. He calls this structure Getting Started, Devising a Plan, Executing Plan, Reflecting. I think this is an excellent way to structure problems and it was certainly the direction I was trying to push students toward when I wrote the “presenting work” document. I’m wary of making solution formats to formulaic, but I think this structure is good for beginning students who might simply want to execute a plan.

The last thing I want to steal are the short questions during lecture. I’m not entirely sure how I would steal this as it seems Eric has generated most of the questions and tailored them to his specific use. Also they’re are in multiple choice format which I have a bias against but which have the benefit of listing incorrect answers (in addition to the correct one) which provide opportunities to explain why wrong approaches are wrong.

Thermal Permutations — Continuum Extrapolation of Lattice Partition Functions
I’ve moved the boulder slightly further up the hill. My most recent conquest is the identity






I haven’t been able to prove this identity, but I’ve checked it in Mathematica. I posted this result on math.stackexchange hoping someone might prove it, but so far I’m satisfied and gratified that I know that it’s true. Now my continuum extrapolation is on a little more solid ground, and I can start trying to understand the physical implications. First a review of the steps I outlined and completed in order to prove this result:

A formula and proof for the higher order logarithmic derivatives of a function as a linear combination of linear derivatives; Termed Grunert’s formula. 

An expression for the Nth moment of a partition function written as a linear combination of N partition functions. 

A demonstration that the linear combination of partition functions reduces to Grunert’s formula.

The last step was achieved (partially) by the identity shown above. 

Next, I need to write up this work in a way so that it is coherent and well motivated. Through the course of the final paper I need to ask the following questions. 
	- Why did you ask this question?
	- What does this result tell you or allow you to do?
	-  Does the equation you derive at the end physically mean anything?

After I get a solid draft of this down, I’ll see if it’s possible to extend the work to the spin glass problem (considering the linear potential first) and then toward the interacting Ising system, a non-equilibrium system, gauge theory, field theory etc.

In Jiwon
In Jiwon I recognize an aloneness—if not an outright loneliness—that I have recognized often in myself. It is true, I am attracted her, and my attraction and her aloneness make me wonder if I am using her vulnerabilities to get closer to her. It seems in the time she has been at Harvard, she hasn’t spoken to many people, or gone out too often. The latter is clear from the fact that she hadn’t seen Boston common until I showed it to her last week (although she has seen the MFA, The Science Museum, and the Aquarium). I think she wants a friend, but I want a lover and I’m using her desire for a friend to maximize the chances that I can convert her. Or perhaps my motivations are transparent, and she is using my own vulnerabilities to get what she wants from me. 

Nights ago, we walked through the halls of MIT’s campus. We stopped outside of 6-120 in the lobby framed by copper artwork of physicist and chemists. As she stared at the likenesses of Maxwell, Faraday, and Newton, I came up behind her and placed my hands on her waist. To my shock she recoiled away laughing nervously. Days ago I had touched her back and her legs without any similar reactions, so to me this reaction came out of the proverbial “left field”. Later we stood together at the railing overlooking the Charles River. The moon was full (or almost full) and I tried to get close to her again and again she danced away with the same nervous laughter. Where was I, I thought. What was I doing? I never acted this way around girls, never tried to touch them or get close to them or show at all through physical proximity my interest in them. I had always tried my best to respect their physical boundaries. And yet here I was violating those boundaries. But how else would she know I liked her? Words in my experience were rarely enough to convince the women I was interested in of my legitimate interest. They always claimed to be baffled when I tried to be as explicit as possible about how I felt. So with Jiwon I was taking a different tact, and yet I was still failing. 

The rest of the night I kept my distance. It occurred to me how strange it was that I now needed to be extra-conscious of how I acted around her. It proved to be an unwelcome pressure on my thoughts. For some reason, as though I had missed all the signs of the night, I asked her is she would want to watch a movie at my house the next day. She thought to herself for 60 seconds (this is not an exaggeration). By the 10 second mark, I realized the answer was no, and she was now simply deciding how best to diplomatically convey her response. “Next time,” she said, which was incredibly and ludicrously disappointing to me. I had first gone out with her a week ago and yet, I expected her to be comfortable coming to my house? Or was this in reality a suitable time frame? I don’t know. 

I’m debating with myself what my next move should be. Writing this has added an extra layer of pessimism to my thoughts of her, but I know this pessimism will not be enough to protect me from falling in love. I must thank Tony for that realization. Thanks also goes to him for freeing me from the illusion that male-female interactions are especially fraught with duplicity. It seems the abstracted principle in my experience with Jiwon, if it exists, is one that I have not yet found. 

At the end of the night at MIT, I walked with her through the T-station up to the edge of her bus stop. I did not hug her good night, but settled for a cordial wave and a smile. 

What am I trying to achieve, anyway? What do I think I want? Is sex really that important? Do you really believe it will be that fulfilling when it occurs? When the intimacy, it’s presumed foundation, is established, do you think you will be made complete? 

You know it is not true, yet you entertain the fiction. Why?

Theory and Applications of Cynicism
About a week ago, my doctor told me I should stop working out and taking protein supplements because my creatine kinase levels were too high. The recommended max was around 200 in some units, and mine were 1768. Since then I have had trouble dealing with anger. Because of the anger, I cannot work. I cannot concentrate. All I feel is this barely controllable tension which makes me want to burn down the world. I had always told myself that the reason I worked out was the same reason I wrote: So I would not explode. It seems I was not just being glib. It seems it is indeed true. 

For years, at least as long ago as my 13th year, my mind has been clouded with an anger I have struggled to regulate. Sometimes I could make the anger work for me, other times it was simply a retardant, always it had to be dealt with in some form. New events have apparently given me a novel source of anger. The positive spin I had put on my relationship with Tony has decayed away and now I seem to have returned fully to the pessimism which held him and everyone else at a distance. I think back to Christine and I realize that although it has been ten years I am still learning the same lessons about human nature I learned back then. The foundational lesson is simple to state: Any faith you place in people is ill-founded for no matter what you think you see, you do not know them. Because I had believed that I could trust Tony, and this belief made me reveal myself to him in ways I had not done so before. The result was that I grew closer to him, and soon afterwards he disappeared. 

I thank him, though, for bringing me fully to the realization that it is not only women I cannot trust. My experiences talking to men and trying my damnedest to date them, reveals that the problem is not women, but simply people, and so the assumptions of sexism and my claims about the fraught nature of man-woman relationships are incomplete for they do not suggest that the distance created between two people in a relationship is fundamentally a function of the psychological and emotional parochialism inevitable to human beings. I am me, you are you, and intimacy and communication be damned, we will always be separate people. 

The lesson has made the world darker again, and in my mind an insidious line of reasoning has taken root. If intimacy is now impossible for me, because trust is now impossible, what value do human relationships hold? The answer is complicated. My sexual experiences with men have been awkward lukewarm affairs and have usually left me feeling like I was going through the motions, quacking, waddling, and waving my arms to give the indication that I was a duck while knowing full well that I was not and could never be. If it wasn’t for Tony, I would now be led to believe that I have simply been pretending to be attracted to men in order to be subversive and counter-cultural. Now I think that the quick encounters and thrown-away connections endemic to this community of former sexual outcasts has made the attractions which lead to enjoyable sex unlikely. It took months of being around Tony before I stopped reflexively drawing away from his touch. How could I expect this comfort to materialize in several hours of interaction?

But whenever I start this line of reasoning, I continue on to note that if Tony is indeed the foil to all my other relationships with men, then surely there is no hope, and connection is indeed impossible. For if the intimacy I had established with Tony, the intimacy which made being with him feel real and honest, was later revealed to be illusory, then in the future what I may imagine to be a real connection is perhaps only real to me. The argument can be distilled as follows: Being with men is only enjoyable if I have an emotionally intimate relationship with them. I do not trust people, so an emotionally intimate relationship is impossible. Being with men is not enjoyable. 

The result is that I feel no loss at being away from the dating apps which I was so obsessed with months ago. There is however something born of boredom and maliciousness which entices me to join these apps and play with men’s desires, feigning and withdrawing interest at a whim, just to add to the nexus of pain these technologies engender daily. I have so far stopped myself from doing so, not out of compassion, but out of selfishness. I know the cost to my own psychological health would be too great because in spite of my cynicism, my moral compass remains largely intact and the pain I intentionally inflict on anyone will simply be reflected back upon me. 

Much of one’s vision and hope for a relationship is contingent on what one idealizes one may find in said relationship. Imagine happiness and you are drawn to opportunities for connection. Imagine desolation and you run from them. For the longest time, my attraction to women was kept at bay because my former relationships had created such scars that the prospect of beginning a new one was equated with preparing for more pain. I saw women and I saw my past and I felt the pain of that past anew. And any novel connection I could have felt in the moment of a new meeting was obscured by a troubled history that this new woman surely had nothing to do with but which I nevertheless believed she was the cause of. 

I have had no sexual experiences with women, so I have not yet learned the lessons concerning intimacy and sexual expression as it applies to someone of not my gender. But I had long ago recognized that emotional intimacy is not likely with women (for reasons which I think I understand much better than the analogous reasons for men), and believing emotional intimacy was the path to sexual intimacy, I was able to obscure my sexual attraction by holding tightly to my pain. But now something has changed, and I am now pursuing the conjecture men have been living for thousands of years:You don’t need to be in love with a woman to have sex with her. The result is a new kind of cynicism, one which differs from my previous one in that instead of drawing away from women categorically, I am trying to use them in one specific way. This cynicism has made me impatient with Jiwon. I want to fuck her (it’s true), but she’s holding me at bay and I am thinking about dropping her, disappearing like so many people have done to me. The calculation is deceptively simple. I want sex. She won’t give it to me. She thus has no value. 

As I’ve mentioned before, I see in Jiwon a loneliness I have seen often in myself. She is in a foreign country, and she has encased herself in a bubble of solitude which protects her and keeps her away from the world outside. She does not like me, I know, and I am taking advantage of her ostensible need for human connection to be around her long enough to wear her down and eventually make her sleep with me. 

The place I have come is a strange one. It seems that being unable to trust other people, makes you yourself untrustworthy.

Social Justice Fridays — September 23, 2016

Professionals as Status-Quo Allies

The systems of education and professional training which creates professionals in effect creates a class of people who tend to be more faithful to their employers and hierarchies of power than they are to questioning those systems. 
Think of William Dershowtiz’s concept of “Excellent Sheep” except apply it to post-graduate studies rather than undergraduate studies. 

Discussion Points

Education far from having the goal of developing real wide-ranging critical skills, has the goal of developing critical skills which will help people fit comfortably within and successfully propagate hierarchies of power. 
Teachers lose much of their credibility by advocating for the development of critical thinking skills through modes of education often indistinguishable from indoctrination. 

Did you ever consider your education as a system of indoctrination? If so, how did you respond/react? 

Lessing’s comment about critics is perceptive (for me at least). Does education teach us to be more critical of new ideas or better able to evaluate or develop them ourselves?

Personal experiences where you on the verge of leaving education/your training. What changed that made you stay?

Schmidt’s argument is not nuanced. He categorically finds fault in technical education. Are there any opposing perspectives (Remember that the argument “developing critical thinking” is one Schmidt would disagree with considering the kind of critical thinking involved)

Qualification procedures are meant not only to establish a base line of skills but also to test how willing students are to subvert/relinquish/subdue/stifle/suppress personal goals to fulfill requirements of the system. What do you think?

How do systems of indoctrination (which attempt to replicate social/economic orders) affect those parts of the population who are not respected/have less value within those orders?


September 24, 2016 — 9:10 AM Saturday
Social Justice Fridays
Yesterday, during Social Justice Fridays I spoke about the way professionals are often trained and selected to be unquestioning perpetrators of the systems which give them status. I grounded my discussion in a quote in the introduction to Lessing’s Golden Notebook and in Schmidt’s Disciplined Minds. The discussion was interesting I think. Only two other people attended (Delilah Gates and John Lewis). On the argument spectrum I think Delilah was decidedly on the status-quo side as she was pushing back against the implications of my argument. In response to my assertion that education is often a form of indoctrination, she said she would be willing to accept it as true as if I were more specific about what students were being indoctrinated into. (My response was a dry one: Students are taught to subordinate personal values to the values of those higher in the hierarchies which employ them)

She also stated that professional education and the community associated with it is a necessary one for it is impossible or at least exceedingly difficult for students to learn how to be scientists on their own. I conceded this point but rejoindered that the necessity of training doesn’t dictate the way students are trained, and the training system we have developed is one which teaches students more than just science. 

The discussion drifted away from the source material and we started talking about our own graduate departments. Delilah had plans to work with Andy Strominger, and I recalled hearing at a graduate student presentation how Andy only was willing to work with a student if the student had plans to commit to an academic career. The student explained that it otherwise felt that Andy was wasting his time. 

I asked Delilah what she though of this. She said she disagreed with it. John mentioned that the problem was less apparent in Harvard’s Astronomy department, and in his experience professors were generally accommodating. 

John and Delilah also levied a more specific point. They said it would be preferred if there were more professors interested in and cognizant of non-academic science work, so that they could tailor their spectrum of possible projects to graduate students interests and what the graduate student might do after their education. 

I disagreed. I was thinking of the many scientists (Maurice Wilkins, Francis Crick, Emanuel Derman, Stephen Wolfram, Robert Kraichman) throughout history who spent their graduate or undergraduate educations working on something not directly related to what they did afterwards. Delilah’s and John’s idea seemed too much like the argument that undergraduate education should be more like vocational training and only geared towards preparing students for jobs. I believed it was possible and even useful for a professor to provide a student with a specific and perhaps unworldly technical project while also acknowledging and accepting that the student might have priorities outside of academia.

Delilah replied stating that if a professor was indeed able to do both, he or she should also be willing to let students choose how they allocate their time and not be offended when students allocate time away from their assigned projects. 

This is something which is clearly difficult to do and cannot be decided within the space of a theoretical discussion. I imagine there are surely teachers who do what I argue (willingly and happily work with students on technical projects while allowing for the possibility that the student will not stay in academia) and there are of course professors who are more hostile to anyone who doesn’t want to replicate their own life histories. From the student’s perspective (or specifically from my own perspective), a professor who is supportive of your scientific work and also supportive of what you value out of science is preferred but rare. Your professors at an R1 university most likely got where they are by having a single minded focus on their work (this is especially true for a competitive field like high energy physics), so it is not surprising that it would be difficult for them to see deep value in something outside physics.

September 25, 2016 — 8:43 AM Sunday

Today I’m taking Jiwon to the Russel Orchards and Crane beach. I’ll probably also check out the Castle near there I haven’t visited yet. It took a few years but I finally found someone I want to take to this place. I’ll be picking her up in a few hours. I hope she doesn’t cancel. 

I think about the chances of her disappearing some time in the future. In particular, how likely it is for her to do so and how I will feel if it happens. I believed that by not exposing myself to her too much I could prevent myself from falling in love but maybe that’s naive. Maybe it isn’t possible to control even indirectly who one falls in love with.

Morality of BLM Movement
I know very little about the BLM movement, its leaders, or its stated intent. From general headlines and the very name it is apparent it’s concerned with fighting against police brutality against black communities.

Of course not everyone agrees with the work of the movement, and there is often an undeniable racial tenor to those disagreements. For example, conservatives apparently driven by their own demographics have fallen predictably along the opposing side, often chanting “blue lives matter” as a rebuttal. Trump catered to these oppositions in his convention speech when he discussed the work of police officers and America’s need to protect them against those who threaten their lives (and implicitly the systems which employ them). 

But recently I’ve been thinking about morality and the BLM movement and I am running into confusion. This is mostly motivated by Colin K’s of the San Francisco 49ers recent protests. He has decided to sit down during the minutes the National Anthem is played before his football games in order to express his opposition to police brutality against black communities. This act has garnered a great deal of attention in the media, with some praising his courage and others criticizing his injection of politics into sports. 

I personally see it as an innocuous and token form of protest, one which questions but does not at all threaten the system he is protesting. But, then again, perhaps all protests can ever be is tokenized, for systems rarely ever tolerate direct threats to their existence, and so what I believe to be a token protest is perhaps the only form of protest that is possible. Would I, for example, label the protest marches of the 1960s south “token protests”? 

Anyway my larger concern is why has Colin chosen this issue to protest. America has been directly responsible for many crimes (like drone strikes) since Colin has been part of the NFL. Why has he not protested any of those? 

As a side note, I think it is interesting the way people choose to protest in ways which question but do not threaten the systems they disagree with. Perhaps because they know the systems would not tolerate any explicit threats to their existence. Perhaps it is because they know they are dependent on the system and do not truly want to be ejected from it. 

Now, In truth I cannot legitimately question Colin’s moral awakening because I do not know anything about him. The idea that he is the same person today that he was years ago is questionable, so I cannot really assume a parity of circumstance to distill an understanding of his priorities from his current protests. Rather, I am  using him as an example of how morality and victimization are not clear cut issues and one must always double check to see if one’s claims of power denial can be couched more completely. 

To be direct I question the morality of anyone who claims victimization without also acknowledging the way they victimize others, if only indirectly. My archetypical model of this is a white man living in Mobile Alabama in the 1960s. The man has a wife and a son, and he works to save money for his son to go to college. He wants his son to go to Harvard but he knows American education is not yet a democratizing institution, and he wonders if there are classist barriers to his son succeeding in a place at Harvard. If his son were to go to Harvard and fail to find a home in the Final Clubs clubs, it would likely be because of prejudice grounded in elitism and tribalism. He is concerned that his son will become a victim of the social parochialism America had yet to outgrow.

Now with the benefit of hindsight, we can look at this story and recognize a dimension of morality the man does not see. Mobile Alabama in the 1960s practiced a racism in which all of its white citizens were complicit. The man described above may not see himself as racist and may have no feelings of hatred toward black people. He may agree with the civil rights movement, but may not take part in it, believing that he has his own problems to deal with. In such a framing the man may believe he cannot be morally implicated in the American systems of racism he just happens to live within, but as someone who has been given unqualified power in this system, it is in fact his passivity which makes him immoral. 

One’s moral myopia extends from the ways he is only willing to engage in the problems which most directly effect himself. And I am afraid that the BLM is mirroring the limited civics which has made large sectors of white America so morally dubious. How truly could you claim a moral superiority due to your own victimization when your claims are grounded in your place (even if not chosen by you) in a system that victimizes others? 

Perhaps it is a limitation of language. Messages should have a lucidity in which it is possible to distill a central point they are trying to convey. Place too many claims in a message, and you dilute the potency of each one. And yet inevitably when you make a single claim “X”, you are by omission not claiming “Y” or “Z”. So if you say one thing, there is always a choice to make, and evident in this choosing is a hierarchy of priorities one cannot help but convey with the message itself.

This is perhaps why the claim “blue lives matter” is so loathsome to many people. The claim is of course true, but when it is said in rebuttal to “black lives matter” one feels the hidden word attached to the assertion is not “too” but “more”. 


The problems of the world, the things we actually identify as problems, and the things we believe are worthy of our attention, suggest much about our moral credibility. Humans have a blinkered tendency to believe their own pain to be more real than the pain of other people. 

And much of the criticism concerning the apathy of white America to the struggles of subordinated groups is centered on an obliviousness which suggests a lack of empathy. The problems we think are focal to America—problems of economy, job availability, and sexuality—are not merely the most important problems which unite us across race and culture but are also not-coincidentally the problems most significant to those whose lives are not demarcated by race. And so the crime of white America is that they have for so long denied their power and their ability to affect change in the lives of those they were indirectly victimizing. They may have recognized and felt that something was immoral about racism, but moral credibility is not established by feeling. It is established through action, and their decisions to act in limited ways toward the ideal of American progress revealed clearly not only their priorities but their fidelity to the tenets—liberty and agency—supposedly definitive of their country. 

September 26, 2016 — Monday 7:59 AM
Can We Have Sex Now?

Jiwon (fortunately!) did not stand me up. I picked her up and drove her to Harvard’s campus so we could eat lunch and then we started our trip. We went to Castle Hill, Crane Beach, and the Russell Orchard in that order. Four years ago (perhaps even on this weekend) I had visited Crane Beach and the Russell Orchard with Nu Delta, but I had never been to Castle hill, the Crane Family Estate. True to its name Castle Hill consists of a mansion (the castle) sitting atop a hill. Jiwon and I walked through the first floor of the mansion of and then walked around the rolling hills of the grounds. The day was beautiful, the light of the sun warming our backs as the breeze from the ocean hit our faces. 

Jiwon (as did I) thought the place was incredible, but I couldn’t help feeling it was somehow felt misaligned with reality, seeming more like the setting of a horror or historical film than like a place people could ever feel comfortable living in. It was expansive in a way that was breathtaking, immodest in its display of wealth, and on the whole vaguely unsettling. I tried to imagine the denizens of the house waking up during the summer and strolling through the grounds, maybe taking a carriage from the house to the beach nearby, or visiting the apple orchards (assuming they were around back then). It was an image I could not reliably distinguish from a dream. 

In a patio down the hill from the house we saw a small statue of Athena. The statue reminded me of the time two weeks ago when I first showed Jiwon around Boston. There was a statue in Boston Common of a Hellenic woman wearing armor and wielding a spear. I had believed the statue was of Athena, but now I was not sure. 

Thinking back to that time led me into a repose, reflecting on our two week relationship. I was glad to be on this coast with her, but each time I looked at her I felt a desire stifled, a hunger denied. Since the first time I took her on a trip around Boston, I had tried to do with her the one thing I had absolutely never done with women I liked: Touch her. Not in anyway overtly sexual, but just in a way that (I believed) communicated I liked her. A hand on her back or on her leg was as far as I ever went, and she took these moves with silence neither drawing into my touch or drawing away.  Earlier in the week before our trip, we ate dinner at Tanjore. At one point I put my hand on her arm and rubbed it with my thumb, and after sensing a change in the air I decided to ask her point blank: “Does it make you uncomfortable when I touch you?” She thought for a minute, and said “Sometimes”. This shocked me, but it certainly lay in the spectrum of answers I was expecting. I asked her why she didn’t tell me, and she couldn’t produce an answer. I felt strangely exposed, as though I and a villain had somehow evolved together and although the villain was vanquished, I had taken his place. I was the guy who harasses women believing he was flirting. I was the one thing I had tried all those years so fervently not to be. 

I apologized and promised not to do it again. But I still wanted to touch her, even more now that it was subtly forbidden. Days later I tried to demarcate the boundaries of what was acceptable. She had said “Sometimes” so maybe some touching was OK. I visited her and she read Einstein’s Dreams to me as our English practice and before I left her office, I asked her if I could hug her. She thought again for what seemed like a literal minute and said yes. 

On our trip to the coast, as we walked along Crane beach, I still felt, in spite of her previous allowance of a hug, a large distance between us. Attempting to bridge this distance, I tried to communicate to her that I wanted to give her a piggy back ride, and she reacted with mild alarm, laughing and scurrying away with a rapid-fire series of “No”s. Afterwards, we drifted away from one another for a while and I plodded my feet through the sand thinking about what I was doing here, why I was still bent on producing a fantasy reality could not support.   

I was still noI’m not sure how she feels about me, which is perhaps indication enough that she likely doesn’t feel anything. 

Perhaps I was being impatient. Our first date was September 11 and it was only September 26. Maybe two weeks wasn’t enough time to develop the level of comfort required for physical intimacy. But I believed it should be enough time to have some sense of how she felt about me, and the fact that I did not know was perhaps indication enough that she did not feel anything. 

After we left Russell Orchards, I drove her to her house. While the car was idling in the bike lane, there was this surreal moment when she leaned in and thanked me for the trip. At that moment I felt she wanted me to kiss her or touch her in some way, but the lessons of the day had left me doubtful of my intuition, so I did nothing. I thanked her for coming with me and waited for her to get out of the car.

What had attracted me to Jiwon was that I did not see in her a fidelity to the tired American scripts of courtship. By being with her, I was trying to avoid the unambiguous but rarely professed distance existing between men and women in America, a veiled but undeniable barrier containing subtle notes of lust, suspicion, and loneliness. But I did not realize that this script also contained implicit schedules on the progression of intimacy, schedules I had never questioned because, one, I had honestly never had the chance to engage in them, and two, I had believed everyone did. But Jiwon seems to neither conform to the courtship rituals nor to the schedule, for although I do not sense in her the discernible fabricated distance I feel around most women the distance appears to be there nonetheless. 

But of course she is Korean and not American and these scripts, being not at all universal, would not apply to her anyway. If she is thinking about our relationship at all, she is viewing it in the context of a script I do not know. And if it is indeed possible to obtain some knowledge of this script and get past Jiwon’s considerable defenses, it seems it would take someone more practiced than I in the methods of seduction.

In truth I believe it is possible to get past Jiwon’s considerable defenses, but it would take someone more practiced in the methods of seduction than I. And I don’t know if I have the patience to build up this practice in real time, as I am with her. 

A crazy idea I have is that maybe I shouldn’t be so accommodating. Maybe I should just take things where I want to take them. Because although she does not always tell me when something makes her uncomfortable, she also does not tell me when she wants me to do something.

Effective Field Theory and Information Loss

The essential problem of developing a more fundamental theory from an effective theory is one of information loss. A non high-energy physics based example is the relationship between thermodynamics and statistical physics. Historically, an understanding of thermodynamics developed before modern statistical mechanics even though statistical mechanics is a more fundamental theory. I think these fields developed “out-of-order” because 1) thermodynamics was more accessible experimentally on everyday length scales and 2) thermodynamics (as an “averaged” theory) did not direct scientists specifically to a theory at smaller length scales. 

A simple analogy exists in probability. If you have a series of ten coin flips, knowing which flips yield heads will let you determine the average value of the flips, but knowing the average value of the flips does not let you determine the exact sequence of flips which yielded that value. In other words, there is more information in the sequence of flips than their is in their average value*. 

Similarly, moving from an elementary theory to an effective theory involves a removal of degrees of freedom which is tantamount to a sort of averaging. So we can similarly say there is more information in a fundamental theory than in an effective theory. But, the interesting point is that having more information is not always necessary. 

Work towards a theory of everything although a worthy intellectual endeavor may not necessarily improve our control of the physical world on everyday length scales, because physics on every day length scales is governed by theories which do not depend on a precise knowledge of a fundamental theory. Physics on our length scale (like Classical Mechanics, for example) is an effective theory which is itself governed by an effective theory (like The Standard Model, for example) whose results do not change to a great extent regardless of whatever more fundamental theory(like, String Theory or Loop Quantum Gravity) it arises from**. 

Moving from a theory on one scale to a theory on a much larger scale requires averaging. If we understand the average effects, we do not necessarily understand the more elementary effects which have led to them, but sometimes we do not have to.

(Could we connect this as well to universality (the idea that in spite of differing microscopic dynamics certain systems exhibit similar collective phenomena)?)

[//]

*We perhaps can gradually obtain more and more information about a macroscopic theory so that we approximate the information content of a microscopic theory. For example, the mean of a bimodal and unimodal distribution may be the same, but the variance (and higher order correlations) would not be the same. 

**This is making me think of a possible exercise in statistical mechanics: two different microscopic theories which yield the same macroscopic theory (Two ensembles which yield the same energy versus temperature dependence; or two microscopic theories which yield the same energy in time evolution); Begin with coin flips (two different spectrums of flips which yield the same average value)

I recently joined Coffee Meets Bagel, a cell phone app which allows men and women to meet and schedule dates. As I scroll through the pictures of women, I cannot help thinking that none of these women are Jiwon. And yet Jiwon is not Tony.

Summary of Notes from Shakhnovich

Professor Shakhnovich mentioned that the oral exam would be mostly based on my prior research but that the research committee gets to ask me whatever they want about the area of work surrounding my research. So that means they can ask me things about microbiology, protein biology, statistical mechanics and phase transitions. 

Slightly more specifically, I should understand basic things concerning amino acids and cell biochemistry. Since I’m dealing with phase transitions I should understand critical phenomena and basic statistical mechanics of phase transitions. This will require me to devise a program of study. Perhaps I can use such a program to learn about other subjects, on my back log of desired subjects to learn.

He also mentioned I should understand why/how my phase transition is actually a quasi-phase transition. 

My microbiology study will be grounded around readings, questions, essays and figures. I’ll read relevant source material, use that material to generate questions, and answer those questions through essays and figures. 

My statistical physics study will be grounded in concepts and calculations. I will devise a list of statistical mechanics calculations I should understand and then collect the relevant calculations. 

Maybe at the end I can combine the two and create a document on Statistical Physics of Microbiology/Biology.

A Bayesian Evaluation of Women

It is strange—so strange I wonder if it is even true—that it was a relationship with a man that softened my perspective on women. I think it came down to what Bayesians would call “priors”, a mathematical term that in a sociological context would be called prejudice. By definition, priors lead one to have a fidelity to his initial belief in spite of any new information which contradicts it. Arguably, one of the reasons humans so constantly engage in tribalism and discrimination is because their thinking is too Bayesian, too dominated by priors which they hold onto regardless of new experiences which can correct them. With women my prior was that I could not trust them, that any sort of relationship with a woman had pain as an outcome and frustration as an intermediary. As a result, I made few attempts to “get to know” a woman, and so there were few opportunities to establish the rapport needed to relinquish my initial fears and see women as more than the caricatures I had painted them as.  Instead, I saw them as dangers which not only failed to advertise themselves as such, but often advertised their innocuity. Wolves in sheep clothing. Land mines buried under flower beds.

But I know—and I have known this for a long time—I am wrong. I had believed there was a fundamental difference between men and women, a hypocrisy which was endemic to one group and which the other had managed to escape. But all my time going out with men and seeing reflected in their eyes the same trepidation and uncertainty I had felt in my own—and recognizing that I, and not a woman, was eliciting these feelings from a man, and that even another man could elicit these feelings from me—has led me to recognize a common travail between all of us. It is the travail of occupying a single body and not really knowing despite language, both verbal and not, what is felt by another. 

The way women see me can harm me if I give their perspective too much credibility. If I internalize it, this vision will exist as a cancer, eating away at the pillars of hope and trust which allow me to connect implicitly, if only infrequently and ephemerally, with new women. But there is a reason women see me the way they do, there is a basis for the distance I so often feel emanating from their gaze. The reason is grounded in fear and ignorance—and, their child, prejudice—surely, but it also stems from what these women see as self-preservation. The caricatures may have been universally internalized from culture, but how one ultimately reacts to the caricature is contingent upon one’s place in said caricature’s larger narrative. And in such narratives it is not difficult to see how fear and pre-emptive attempts to eliminate the cause of fear can legitimately be characterized as self-preservation, even when the original fear is itself illegitimate. 

With these thoughts I am led to an exercise to help me delineate the boundaries of such legitimate fear. What is it like, from morning to night, to be a woman? 

Today Jiwon told me that she often feels afraid walking around at night because of what guys say to her. Her example was “you have beautiful legs like a dancer”. Jiwon is unusually pretty, so I had always assumed she would be getting attention, but it was still surprising to hear this from her. It was the first time a woman had ever told me about an occurrence which modern legend claims happens so frequently. She also told me about a guy who constantly texts her. It was a guy she first mentioned on the morning I took her to Russell Orchard. Back then she said he had greeted her at the bus stop, and told her that he speaks five languages, one of which was Korean. Apparently, Jiwon and the guy live near one another and after one of their bus rides home, he asked her to talk to him for a while. Eventually, he told her he was really lonely and that he wanted her to come home with him. She demured, and now she is avoiding his text messages, but she is not sure what to do because he knows where she lives. 

I felt a conflation of emotions: A premonition that this was where my and Jiwon’s relationship would eventually end up, me sending her texts that she responded to with silence; A basic sense of jealousy from recognizing my competition; A surreal sense of seeing myself in another, for I—as recently as Wednesday actually—have often asked Jiwon to come home with me. And more deeply a wonder of whether this was the first sign that she was drawing away. In Alfred Hayes’s In Love the narrator’s lover conveys to him a ridiculous incident in which a man approaches her and expresses his interest. The narrator and the lover laugh together but by the end of the book, the lover is with the new man. In James Baldwin’s Another Country, the character Vivaldo fears that his girlfriend Ida is sleeping with an unattractive man they both met at a party. At one point Vivaldo is direct in his accusation, and although Ida caustically denies his claims, by the end we learn that it was all true. And so I imagined a future without Jiwon, a future where she is with this guy who I had never seen, and where I was left wondering what he had done to court her away from me. 

Thoughts of losing Jiwon were the seeds for this latter vision, for I know I can lose Jiwon, much in the same way I have lost so many others. For one, there is an airy complacency which could befall me and which would surely result in her disappearance, sooner or later. But I also know there is an entire invisible spectrum of actions and inactions I have yet to learn how to avoid because it will be only through her disappearance that I will become cognizant that they exist. So even outside of the fear of external perturbations, I realized the unperturbed system was itself unstable, that even without the presence of this guy, my days with Jiwon were perhaps numbered in manifold ways I had yet to see.

And finally, from Jiwon’s story I felt fear. It was a fear for her, certainly, but her descriptions also sucked me into her perspective and I soon imagined myself walking amongst Cambridge’s streets, fearing what men would say and fearing how what they said suggested about what they might do. How would I know who was someone I could trust? How would I stop someone I did not trust from constantly approaching me? How would I sanely exist and think about my work without having a nervous breakdown?

So with Jiwon, my empathy exercise was already halfway completed. The exercise was initially unconstrained for not all women share the same experiences, but Jiwon’s story gave it a grounding through her own experiences. 

I imagine waking up and having in my mind the things I would like to accomplish today. I imagine hating my body as a woman. I imagine wanting to find a man who I love and who loves me, but recognizing that men as a statistical average are superficial and, due to social norms, the man I want may not want me or simply not make the effort to get to know who I am. I imagine not being able to work late into the night because doing so would force me to walk Cambridge’s dark streets at a time when there is no guarantee that I will not be accosted by a stranger. And as a woman how would I see Mobolaji’s physical body. I cannot help but be biased by the way women apparently do regard me: with trepidation and hesitation, with a subtle fear and distance they often fail to mask. So Mobolaji would be what his appearance tells me he is: A black man, a thing which in America is riddled with associations and definitions he perhaps cannot control, but which I must nevertheless probabilistically associate with him for my own safety. These definitions control his reality because they control how others see him, but they would control my reality too because they delimit the places where I would feel safe. 

As this woman what would the world of work be like? What would my ambitions be, how would I see these ambitions while recognizing they will not be fundamental to my finding a romantic partner? Would this need to simply do the work rather than doing the work for the goal of finding someone who will love you and spend the rest of their lives with you because of the work make the doing cleaner? Less filled with anger?

What would the world of work be like, a world which you know is subtly (or not so subtly) misogynistic?

What would it be like to be a black woman in one of the many graduate department at Harvard? What would it be like to be a black woman in my department the physics department?

Do I envision myself as a woman I am attracted to, or as someone else? And what does this choice declare about the limitations of my own empathy?



For some reason I feel I can better empathize with woman. I think this is partly due to Jiwon and how she has so far expanded my idea of what a relationship can consist of. I can now imagine having a relationship with a woman, an imagining I seemed incapable of years, or rather months ago. I have recently joined Coffee Meets Bagel again and will be trying to go on a date. 

Is sex really so important that you need to orchestrate its arrival? I have been thinking about sex rather constantly recently, and I am led to question why I am doing so. The main reason I joined Coffee Meets Bagel was in reaction to Jiwon’s distance. I imagined her sometime in the future in my bed, with me above her, doing things to her which induced in her reactions she could not control. But with the distance and its constant presence in our interactions, I realized the dream was too far removed from anything I could achieve in that proverbial future and so if it really was sex I wanted I had to achieve it another way. But my interactions with men and based on a parity of how those interactions could have played out with women, I knew that sex, naked and uncommitted without the rapport to substantiate it, was dark dirty and despairing. And so if I wanted to do it, and not hate myself afterwards I would have to simulate at least the image of a relationship, something which could fool my mind into believing it was not simply being controlled by the so called “baser instincts” but was communicating something authentic and beautiful. In January when he last visited Boston, Peter told me Coffee Meets Bagel was a good dating app if one was looking for more than a hook up. So far I have yet to use it successfully. I look at the woman on the app and I try to imagine the guy they’re looking for.

“My prejudices are revealed. I seem to not like white women and seem to like black women even less. Perhaps, my image of the typical black woman clashes with my image of who I can be with.” 


no chance to see women as anything but land mines buried under flower beds

and without this ability to trust there was no opportunity for rapport, 


This exercise, as it is, is still much too unconstrained for not all women share the same experiences. A woman born in Colorado would not wake up the same way or think the same thoughts throughout the day as a woman who immigrated from Kenya. And my choice of which women’s experiences deserve identification will reveal clearly further prejudices which deserve correction. But we must make progress where we can.


I believed there was a fundamental moral difference between men and women. A hypocrisy which seemed to define one group but which the other was free from.

Draft of Teaching as Storytelling Work
Today I want to talk about two things, faith and science. Now these two things are apparently opposed and reside in separate regions of human thought and feeling. 

I certainly thought so, for the longest time. One week into my freshman year of high school, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in New Orleans. My family decided not to evacuate, but it turns out we were lucky. My awkward explanation whenever someone asks me about this time is that my family lived on the other side of the river from where the levees broke. So although New Orleans city district was many feet under water, my house just received damage (although bad) was just from the wind and the rain.

My family chose to stay, but we did not choose which parts of the levees broke, and the parts of the levee which broke certainly determined my subsequent life. Thousands of people died from flooding in New Orleans, and I perhaps could have been one of them. 

And this fact leads me to the question of faith. How can you have faith in a world which not only randomly can change the circumstances of your life, but in which the circumstances of your birth dictate that life. 

You might have chosen to come to this class, but 20 or 30 years ago on your very first birthday, you did not choose to be born and you did not choose the circumstances of your birth. 

Perhaps the moral arc of the universe does not bend toward justice, perhaps it doesn’t bend toward anything because the universe has no moral arc. And morality was merely a concept humans developed to give them sense and direction to their lives. And most of all meaning. 

Years after Hurricane Katrina I started learning classical mechanics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics and I learned that amidst the chaos of history and life events there is a discernible order to the world. There is a structure that can be appreciated without being good at math or science. You can appreciate the electromagnetism without being Maxwell. You can wonder at the possibility of extra dimensions without being Lisa Randall. 

And most of all, this structure can be discovered by humans. And this is where faith re enters the picture. Because what physics taught me was that although the world is not manifestly full of meaning, it is not arbitrary. There is a reason for processes on this earth, of which human life is one. And a world which is not arbitrary is certainly one in which it is possible to find faith.

Jiwon at the Bar
Today I showed Jiwon the bar in the Caspersen student center. I ordered a Samuel Adams for both of us and we shared a can of Guinness. The Sam Adams was palatable. The Guinness was terrible. Jiwon becomes slightly more talkative when she drinks. Normally she is quite silent, but after the Sam Adams she spoke like a sober American. 

I learned that she has had five or six boyfriends. This surprised me and made me slightly ashamed for she told me this after I had told her I had never had a girlfriend. I obliquely asked when do people in Korea start a sexual relationship. She said it only happened when they became boyfriend and girlfriend, or lovers. This latter prospect excited me. I had begun to think Jiwon wasn’t interested in that kind of intimacy. I asked her how many lovers she had. She thought for 30 seconds, and said No Comment. This was OK, I wanted to just know if she had ever had one. It is strange (or perhaps not so strange), but the idea of her wanting and enjoying sex humanized her in a way, it made her seem more accessible. 

How, I asked her, do people start relationships. Blind dates, was her first response. Her second response surprised me. Friends becoming lovers, she said. I wondered silently to myself if she was speaking from experience. I wondered even more what it would be like to have Jiwon as a lover. 
 
She told me about one experience at the Food Trucks in the Science Center Plaza. The Food Truck workers could never seem to pronounce her name, so she wanted an American name that was easier. I should have opposed this because I very much like her name, but I played along. Her first thought was “Jane”, but she said she couldn’t use it because it was too plain—which means either Jiwon’s English is better than I think it is or “Jane” sounds plain regardless of the foreign language which exists as your reference point. “Shannon” was my suggestion. She said it was too hard. I went back to the Js. “Julia” I said. She said it to herself twice. I said her name in full out loud “Julia Lee”. It sounded quite beautiful to me. She seemed to think it was OK. She said she would try it later this week at the food truck. 

Likely slightly inebriated myself, I asked Jiwon if she thought I was attractive. She thought for a minute, and then tried to clarify something. Our relationship is a friendship, she said. What did that mean I thought. Is she telling me this as a way to say “No offense, but what I’m about to say will hurt your feelings,” or “I’m about to give you a compliment, but don’t look too deeply into it.” It seems it was the latter. 

She said I was warm, thoughtful, and a cute person. Warm and thoughtful because I remembered things about her. I was cute apparently because of the note I left her on her door with a nail clipper. She also said that I was smart, but perhaps too smart. She was referring to the time I mentioned she was taking advantage of me because I liked her. She had asked me to edit a paper, and that was my response. Her reaction was one of surprise and shock. I was shocked by her response (although I was and still am wary of women taking advantage of my predisposition toward kindness). I was only kidding I told her. She had apparently accepted this copout, but only apparently. Tonight she explained that after that exchange she had believed we couldn’t be friends if I thought that way. Of course, she mentioned as caveat, she knew who I was better than before so she had a better context to view such statements. She was essentially no longer offended. But I was still shocked that such was something in which she could find offense. 

I asked her what her favorite season was. She told me spring. I should have asked her why, but instead I asked her which season she likes the least. She said winter. My seasons respectively were fall and summer. Fall because of the early setting sun, and only mild chill. Summer because of how the constant presence of the sun offends my opposing mental state. 

At one point I asked her if in some other context, we could ever be more than friends. What other context she asked. I said suppose if I went on an exchange program to Korea, and we met each other at a party, what could happen between us? Would it stop at friendship? I cannot remember her answer. 

Strangest moment of the night: I ran into Dat after I walked Jiwon to the bus stop. It was like being transported months back in time. I see the person I was back then. I even feel some of what he feels, but he largely seems like another entity, like a being trapped in a dimension I do not and have never did occupy. Looking into Dat’s eyes I saw something (perhaps my own reflected guilt) which made me feel that he knew I had been intentionally not calling him. He came into Cambridge on the 28th, and it was now the 4th. He had told me the date weeks ago. I suppose the idea was that I would do with that information what I will, but what I have been doing is nothing.

  The explanation was my statement that she was taking advantage of me. 










Rube Goldberg Project Advice
— Complete mismanagement of resources; Don’t spend three weeks building the device and a few days building the actual mechanism.
— Students should work to organize their project before they begin building. When are you going to do each step of the design. 
— Criteria for breakdown and safety
	- No Rat Traps
	- Flying sharp objects should have barriers built around it
	- (Reliability Criterion) 3 for 3 and 1 for 2
		- 
— How are you going to attach components to the platform? Duct tape is likely inefficient. 
— Ask them to be cognizant of how they coordinate; division of labor is useful but make sure your components are compatible. 





In a way similar to how I need to move past my fear of emotional harm in order to be attracted to a woman, a woman needs to move past her fear of physical harm in order to be attracted to a man.

Jiwon in Tears
I ruined a perfectly amicable night by making Jiwon cry. 

We went to Queenshead, it being one of the half-a-dozen places I have wanted to take her. I ordered a Guinness for her and a ginger ale for me, and then we shared a Samuel Adams and a plate of fries. I don’t remember us talking about anything deeply interesting, but I do remember touching her. When I am around Jiwon I have to exert some considerable control not to touch her. I’ve learned she does not like being touched in certain environments or in certain ways. But sometimes I make a conscious decision to relax that control, feeling that, despite her wishes, she should know through touch and contact how I feel about her. While we sat together in Queenshead, her earrings would catch the from time to time, shimmering and dancing at the side of her face like tiny mirrors. I raised my hand to her earlobe and moved her hair to the side so I could see her earring better, and she remained perfectly still as if she was waiting for something. I told her I liked her earrings and returned my hand to my lap. She nodded and touched her earrings herself. “Would you like to wear them?” she asked. 

At another point I put my hand on her arm squeezing it softly. She didn’t draw away or look uncomfortable. Beyond simply accepting it, I got the sense that it was OK that I was touching her, that she was not merely tolerating my touch but welcoming it. What had changed? Time, and its influence on our relationship, perhaps? In any case, something had happened without Jiwon telling me, and I think this is perhaps par for the course. If our relationship managed to progress to the point where Jiwon was OK with me touching more than her arm, I sense she would never tell me, never give me any signal, and would simply wait and see what I would do. 

We left the bar and I started walking with Jiwon to the river. We spoke as we walked, but only one conversational thread stands out. She asked me if I had ever tried to have a girlfriend, and I avoided the question, pretending I did not understand what she was saying. (I wonder if she ever does this to me?) She made the mistake of asking me what I did in college. She certainly meant “What did you do for relationships?” but I interpreted it academically and began listing my MIT course schedule. “Mechanics, Electromagnetism…” By the time I got to my Junior year courses, she stopped me and asked me what did my answer have to do with her question. 

We walked through John F. Kennedy Park. We were the only ones there in the lamp lit terrace/area. Jiwon seemed happy. She was almost skipping through the park, jumping periodically to touch the leaves of a nearby tree, spinning in a quick circle to look at me for a second before continuing on. It felt oddly strange to see Jiwon this happy and to know that I was in someway the cause of her happiness. At the end of the park, we turned to the street and walked across it to the Charles River on the other side. The moon was half full and the water was eerily and incongruously still. Shouldn’t river water be moving, I asked myself. We sat on a bench over looking the water, and settled into the sporadic silence around us. To our backs, cars would drive by and our silence would be interrupted by tires grinding through asphalt. But soon even this could be ignored, and I settled into a calm which made me unwary and uncareful. I was happy to be here with Jiwon, a happiness I had not known was possible when Tony disappeared a month ago. 

“If you can be anywhere in the world right now, where would you be?” I asked Jiwon. 

The question was of the kind that the questioner asks more so because he wants to get his own answer than he wants to hear from his partner. Jiwon was quiet for a second and then she let out a soft and breathy “Home.” This was the answer I should have anticipated, the answer I would have certainly known she would give if only I had been thinking about something larger than what I was feeling. Afterwards she put her hands to her face. For some time I looked at her, confused as to what was happening, but soon I realized she was crying. My confusion had transformed into shock, and I moved over to her and put my arms around her shoulder. 

“I’m sorry,” I said, “I’m sorry.” She continued to cry. Between her sobs she managed to ask me a question. 

“Why did you ask me that?” She had told me a few times she was homesick, and whenever she said it a melancholia would descend upon our conversation which I felt long after we had said goodbye.
She missed her friends and her family. I knew this. I knew that this was perhaps the eternal preoccupation of her mind. I knew that her loneliness and estrangement was the reason she risked spending time with me even though she knew I liked her and that I would likely try something. And yet, the very moment she seemed to have relaxed and stepped away from her nostalgia, I pulled her back into it with my question.

I struggled for words. What I was feeling was strangely more clear than my ability to articulate it. I tried anyway. “When I asked you where you would want to be, it was because I already knew what my answer was. I would want to be right here.” She heard this but continued to cry. The loneliness I had always sensed in Jiwon had risen up large and grey, and now it was swallowing her and for some reason I felt if I was not careful it could swallow me too.

But I stayed with her, my fingers pressing into her arms. my other hand on her leg, rubbing her like a lamp, wishing I could travel back in time to before I had said anything. But, then again, if I had such powers, I might instead choose to travel through space in order to bring Jiwon home again.

I began diversionary tactics. A story, I believed, would take her mind off whatever images and feelings were making her cry. My first story was about my time in Switzerland, and how my friend and I met some European drug dealers on a train and were almost deported from the country. The story was entirely untrue and I made it up sentence by spoken sentence. When it got too incoherent even for me to keep up with the fiction, I switched to the story of my last ditch attempt to court Lesley. 

Now that I am writing this, I suddenly remember that Lesley started to cry right after I kissed her. I did my stupid little dance routine to Mariah Carey’s “All I want for Christmas is You”, walked up to her, put my left hand on her neck and kissed her, and when I pulled away she was in tears. I think she explained it had something to do with her ex-boyfriend. All the times that I have recalled this memory, I managed to omit this part, instead focusing on the process of getting her to the room, and the aftermath of our relationship. But this moment certainly occurred. Lesley certainly cried, a fact which gains tragic import when I recognize that she was the first person I had kissed in my adult life.

After I told her about my failed courtship attempt, Jiwon sniffed and said that the story was just like me. I think she was referring to the note and nail clipper I had left on her door, finding some semblance between a guy who would do that and a guy who would devise an adventure trail for a girl he was infatuated with. After a while, she stopped crying and I disengaged from her and sat with her quietly. I stared at the waters, wondering how this night could have turned so terrible. 

Jiwon does this thing which is incredibly endearing. When we’re sitting facing the same direction (like we often are doing in her office), she would whip her hair to her side farthest from me and angle her head, staring at me with her face at a slight tilt for a full second before saying anything. She did the same thing as we walked back into John F. Kennedy Park. She looked at me and then said as a mock accusation “You made me cry.” I think she meant it vaguely as a joke. I have no idea what my facial expression was, but I forced out a laugh. 

We walked to the Red Line’s Harvard Square station entirely in silence. When we got there she sat down at a bench, and I, feeling restless, stood and paced about. She patted the space of wooden bench next to her, and I sat down at her side, my hands clasped between my knees, my chin tucked into my chest. I don’t think we spoke, until her bus came and I told her goodbye. 

Later in the night I sent her a message. “I don’t want to make you feel more lonely.” I told her. “It’s OK,” she responded. “I’m good now.” 

Two things you should know. You’re trying not to say you’re falling for her because you think even entertaining the idea would lead to a self fulfilling prophecy. But you should know refusing to say it doesn’t make it any less true. Your feelings for her are growing in ways your calloused heart should not be able to accommodate. Yet still they grow.

my goal here is to argue there are some spaces of physics have yet to be explored because their motivation exists not in physical phenomena but in biology.

Introduction to Discussion
In this work, motivated by (an abstraction of) a foundational problem in protein design, we posited and analyzed the basic properties of a statistical physics (thermally distributed) model of permutations. In this model, we found that due a state space which could not be factorized in a basis defined by lattice sites (ould not be factorized according to lattice sites along lattice-site lines), even the superficially non-interacting system can exhibit quasi-phase transitions, which are given the label “quasi” because they do note exhibit the properties typically associated which phase transitions. When interactions are introduced through a quadratic mean field term, contingent on parameter choices the system is capable of exhibiting five regimes of equilibrium behavior, and is characterized by two critical-temperatures corresponding to various quasi-phase transitions. For a Hamiltonian defined by an arbitrary polynomial of a mean field term, we found we could associate our system of permutations with a continuum model. The continuum model is defined by a partial differential equation whose solution has similar (quasi) phase behavior as the  partition function of the original permutation model. 

Final Statement of Discussion
The introduced model is exactly soluble for certain interaction assumptions and thus provides a concrete model based understanding of a system with a non-factorizable state space. Because of it’s utility and type of results for the situations discussed in this paper, the model deserves to be subject to the standard extensions of typical canonical models in statistical mechanics (i.e., non-trivial site dependent interactions, disorder assumptions, near equilibrium time evolution, renormalization group properties, etc.) We plan to explore these extensions in future papers. 


Add to Introductory Section (Why we call it a quasi-phase transition?)
We claim the system exhibits does not exhibit true phase transition behavior for three related reasons which together invalidate the interpretation of these results within the traditional thermodynamic definition of phase transitions.

First, our computed critical temperature varies inversely with $N$ and thus disappears in the thermodynamic $N\to \infty$ limit. However, unlike typical statistical physics models the size of our state space ${\cal Q}$ does not satisfy the extensivity requirement (citation?) $\lim_{N\to \infty} \ln {\cal Q}/N = \text{finite}$. Thus it is not even clear that a thermodynamic limit or its associated results (like the finiteness of critical temperature values) makes sense for this model. 

Second, phase transitions are associated with divergences in the free energy or its derivatives but there is no divergence in the free energy associated with the partition function $Z_{N}(\beta\lambda)$ (equation reference) for possible parameter values. The same could be said for the double integral expression of the partition function associated with the quadratic mean field model.

Most, fundamentally, there is no clear thermodynamic interpretation to this model as it is motivated by a Monte Carlo procedure rather than a physical system. In the Monte Carlo implementation our $k_B T = 1/\beta$ does not represent a physical temperature but rather defines the energy scale for allowed state transitions in the Monte Carlo state search. 

For all of these reasons we qualify the apparent mathematical result of phase behavior demarcated by a specific $\beta$ values, by denoting the behavior as quasi-phase behavior. 


Added to Introduction concerning motivation for model
There are two possible resolutions to this problem in protein design. One is to maximize the energy difference between the low energy folded native structure and the higher energy misfolded/denatured structures. The other is to take native structure as fixed and conduct our sequence search under the assumption of fixed amino-acid composition of the polypeptide chain \cite{morrissey1996design}. That is , for a polypeptide chain with $20$ residues rather than searching over the entire sequence space (of size $20^N$), one searches over a space of sequences composed of a fixed number of each amino acid (of size $N!/n_1! n_2!\ldots n_{20}!$). Motivated by the latter resolution, we introduce our model of permutations.

Error and Indecision

Yesterday during the dinner for Physics 95, Doug Finkbeiner paraphrased a quote on one of the buildings in Princeton:

Error often leads to truth faster than indecision. 

He was explaining how changing fields in physics and making mistakes about career direction were in general better than the alternative of being so paralyzed by the possibilities of choice that you did not choose anything. 

A powerful statement, I thought, one which is certainly true of my experience. And it is really not only a matter of truth but something wider, something about life and how one can live it. My major moments of indecision (going to Stanford, joining Nu Delta, attending Harvard) could perhaps have felt less existentially trenchant had I had the depth of insight to realize that whatever decision I had made my life would not end.

There are many things about which I am indecisive and that indecision is likely preventing me from achieving the very thing that I fear a conclusive decision would cause me to lose. Ira Glass has expressed a similar sentiment in response to what he saw as an American culture which fetishized passion and calling: “The idea that you could achieve your passion in the abstract is a tragic mistake.” The better idea, he said, was to find something you were vaguely interested in and pursue it to see if a deeper interest develops. Elizabeth Gilbert expressed similar ideas in one of her podcast interviews. 

Random
When I asked him and Cora Dvorkin if there was ever a time when they felt they wouldn’t make it in physics, he told a really incredible story. He failed the entrance exam for Berkeley twice (he was 32 out of about 60 students to fail it the first time, and then 7 of that 32 to fail it again) and then took a remedial summer course where he learned enough physics to continue with the program. He later went on to win the best dissertation prize in the physics department. Cora Dvorkin told a story about wanting to work with a Professor Hu in U Chicago and later learning hat he was not taking any students. She said she was quite disappointed by this (which I personally felt was a far cry from “not making it in physics”), but ended up working with one of his post-doc for some time. She later became his student. 

Assignment Deadline, Textual Streams, and Presentation Topics

Hi Everyone,

This is just a notice that Topic 2 public presentations will begin this Monday Oct 31. 

Group A: Kirstin, Constantin, Charlotte, Josh, Katie, Anna, Hayley

Group B: Francesca, Shadi, Elgin, Andrew, Tommy, Gray, Noah

Group A will be submitting slides and giving 8 min spoken presentations during class, and Group B will be submitting meeting policy guidance or press releases.  As I mentioned during the dinner, the assignments are due tomorrow at 2pm.

Competing Textual Streams

I want to mention something about using the medium of power point. When you’re reading text, it is difficult to take in language information from another source. For example, if someone were speaking to you now it would be difficult to both listen to them and read this paragraph. The same thing happens when an audience is looking at slides. When there is any text on a slide, the audience must make a choice contingent on how hard it is to read the text. If the cognitive load to read the slide text is too great (either because it’s a lot of text or it’s very technical) the audience either isn’t going to read it or is going to read it and not listen to you.  

Consequently, often a speaker’s slide text and his voice-over compete for the audience’s attention. In the worst cases, both sides lose and the audience completely disengages and simply waits for the slide (or the presentation) to be over. 

Instead you should instead aim to build slides which complement your voice-over. This often means limiting text to very simple phrases, or not using it at all. A slide presentation is not a textual summary of a topic sequestered into a dozen block segments. It should be a visual narrative uniquely suited to the medium of slide presentations or power points. So, you should take advantage of this medium in order to present information in a way that a paper cannot.

If you’re looking for an archetype good example of using slides as a complement is Steve Job’s Keynote introduction to the iPad: https://youtu.be/FtBpZltfR7o?t=20s

(I should also mention that it should still be possible to create stand alone slides, without paragraphs of text)

Dinner for Jiwon

Friday night I made dinner for Jiwon. Earlier in the week I helped her edit an abstract for a paper submission, and she thanked me and said she wished she could do something for me to return the favor. There were things I thought she could do, but none of them were things I imagined she would ever do, so I did not mention them. What I did offer was that she should let me make her dinner, with the implication that although I would be again doing something for her it would be something that I too would enjoy. I had suggested making her dinner weeks ago and she was not enthusiastic about the idea of coming to my home, so I dropped the issue. But now she said OK. 

I drove somewhat recklessly through the rainy streets of Boston. I took arguably illegal turns through gas stations. I almost hit a pedestrian who did not look both ways before crossing the street. I made a dangerous U turn on a street pass. I was disturbed, and finding it difficult to control my emotions. 

As we drove to the Parkdale House, Jiwon expressed her nervousness at coming to my house and meeting my roommates. I should have anticipated this, for such nervousness was completely consistent with what I knew about her personality. I told her not to worry; my roommates were nice people. She understandably was not swayed by this reassurance. EJ was the only one at the house when we arrived, she greeted him and we went to the kitchen to start cooking. 

Or actually, I started cooking. Jiwon washed the spinach leaves, and then rested against the refrigerator to watch my preparations. Almost immediately she began expressing doubts in my cooking abilities. “Have you made this before?” she asked. I told her I have. And she seemed to accept this only to ask moments later if I was sure I had made this dish before. The problem, she explained, was that I was apparently doing things out of order or incorrectly: cooking the pasta before the chicken, boiling the water for the pasta at too low of a heat. I laughed at this, but secretly wondered if she was seeing something I could not, something which foretold the doom of this evening and ultimately what existed of our relationship. “Relax,” I told her, “I know what I’m doing.” She said OK, but merely traded her voiced expressions of concern for physical ones. I always knew I was doing something objectionable because I could feel her squirming behind me. At one point she even put her face in her hands and shook her head. This, I thought, was not good for either of us. “How about this,” I suggested, “you can stay in my room, and I’ll continue to cook here. I will call you when the food is ready.” She said it was OK, she would stay, but later she did decide to go to my room. 

With Jiwon out of the kitchen and slightly less on my mind, dinner was completed as intended. EJ had left the house by this point so we had the floor to ourselves. The dish was chicken and spinach Alfredo with pasta, something that I have made at least a half a dozen times over the course of this year. In spite of her initial concerns, Jiwon seemed to enjoy the food—or merely pretended to do so—and she asked for seconds. 

As I sat there with Jiwon eating food that I had made for her that I had made for the both of us, I felt a strange aura descend upon the dining room suggesting I had been transported to some far away phantasmagorical space. She was here and I was here and, strangely of all, we were here together as we had been in so many of my waking dreams. I stared at her throughout, half-believing her an apparition, half-believing I was not really where I thought I was and knowing I would soon awake to an alarm and a dimly lit morning sky. 

We finished dinner at about 7:30 PM. I had rented the car until 10:00 PM, so I told her we still had some time. We could watch a movie, or I could take her home. She said a two-hour movie would be too close to the rental-time. I explained that the movie I was thinking of was only an hour and 20 minutes. She thought a bit, and then asked if I had any other ideas. I was caught off-guard by this. I could have imagined her saying yes to the movie, or even more likely asking me to take her home, but I had not yet thought beyond these two options. 

For some odd reason I was banking on the movie to lead somewhere in a desired direction. But of course this was ludicrous. Jiwon, who did not want me to touch her or express at all physically my attraction to her, would certainly not fall into my arms or simply sit closer than 6 inches away from me even if we were alone in a house watching a movie. It is not clear what I was thinking when I suggested we watch something, but it is clear that something other than logic was driving the suggestion. 

What else could we do? Let me make love to you, I said silently in my head. I didn’t say it aloud because I was afraid she would leave, or better yet I don’t think I could have said it with a straight face. I likely could not have even followed through with all of the fantasies swirling in my head had I been presented with an opportunity to do so. 

I think she was the one who suggested we drive around. “Where will we drive to?” I asked her. “I don’t know. Suggest something.” She was the one who wanted to drive somewhere, but she wanted me to choose the destination. This seemed not only nonsensical; it felt vaguely exploitative. I had made both of us dinner, had suggested a follow up activity which she vetoed, and now she wanted me to come up with and execute some other plan for the night. Wasn’t it presumptuous to assume that I would just go along with this? But then again, in the month and a half that we have been together perhaps I had displayed enough of my tractability that she knew precisely how this would play out. She would request something and the request would be faithfully executed. Is this why she doesn’t like me? How could anyone like or respect someone they could control so easily?

It was when we got in the car that the night took a turn for the worse. We were driving down Kirkland street toward Harvard, when in an odd moment of voiced introspection, I asked her if she liked hanging out with me. She didn’t say anything at first, and then when she finally spoke her answer was a hedge. She asked whether I meant “hanging out” or  “hanging out with me”.  What was the intent of this distinction, I asked myself. I debated whether this was a language barrier issue, whether she really did not understand how meaningless the former was and how the latter was really the only thing I could be asking. But I ultimately decided that Jiwon knew English much better than she pretended to at times, and she was in fact buying time. I was instantly incensed. To me the question was simple, totally un-nuanced. I simply wanted her to affirm what I was gleaning from her actions, that the reason she always said “Yes” to our outing was because she enjoyed being with me.  I just wanted to hear her say it. But she couldn’t say it. Instead her clarification seemed to suggest, that all of these “Yes”s were said in response to the event and not at all to me. I did not matter. She did not care who she went on these outings with as long as he was tractable and not likely to sexually assault her. 

So, I decided to take her home. The original plan was to go to Back Bay Fens and visit the Angel statue but this exchange had made me livid. I needed time to think. I needed to be away from her. I stopped the car a few houses down from where she lived, and thanked her for having dinner with me. I looked straight and out the side window, but felt her eyes on me. She still wanted to talk. She wanted to resolve something, I was not interested in resolving. “Could we drive some more?” she asked. “Where do you want to drive to?” She still didn’t know. I probably should have kicked her out of the car right then, but I acquiesced and turned the car around in the direction from which we came. 

The subsequent discussion was unenlightening. She told me she hesitated because she felt she knew the intent of my question—of which she was absolutely correct—and wanted to make sure I knew she only saw me as a friend. She also expressed reservations about the possibility that she was taking advantage of me, using the fact that I like her to some abstract gain, like this dinner for example. She was afraid she was using me. I too was afraid of this, but I reassured her that the things I did for her were freely done. This is of course not true. Everything I did was done with the explicit goal of having her naked in my bed, moaning and twisting under my motion. So it was not true that she was using me; she was merely using my attraction to her and I simply lacked the will to stop her. She was manipulating me through my feelings and I allowed it to happen. 

The Two Sides
— The only reason you still want to talk to her is because you think you can still sleep with her. 
— No I like being around her.
— Sometimes. 
— Yes, sometimes. But I do like being around her. 
— You will like being around her until she gets tired of you and throws you away like they always do. And then you will wish you had the will power to cut her loose when you had the agency to do so. 
— Hurt them before they hurt me. That’s what you’re suggesting. 
— How can you not have learned from your experiences? She isn’t even supposed to be important. She was supposed to help you get over him, not become someone else you need to get over. 
— You know that’s bull shit. You knew damn well the risks of starting a new relationship with someone. You knew that feeling this way was a possible or even likely outcome. 
— Yea, I knew, but guess I also had too much faith in your cynicism. Or the appearances of it. After something terrible happens, you say you’ll never go through something like it again. Not because you will choose not to go through it, but because you are now emotionally unable to do so because you’re too cynical. Get hurt by too many people and soon you stop trusting anyone and they then lose the ability to hurt you. But you know what? Your cynicism isn’t real. It’s just of the melodramatic sort. The kind associated with a tantrum. You actually still believe there are good people out there who will consider your feelings before they do something that could possibly destroy you. You are still naive, and if your experience with this girl needs to be another object lesson to disabuse you of your naiveté then so be it. I will sit back and let you experience the pain you so desperately want to experience. 

 “I know you’re a good man,” she told me at some point. This of course is the last thing a guy wants to hear, for he knows the unstated phrase is “who I will never be sexually attracted to.” The night and our relationship had spiraled into oblivion long ago and I was only now realizing it. Something, I believed, needed to be salvaged. This could be the last night I would ever see her. I needed something which would add to the narrative that I knew I would write—the very narrative I am writing now. 

“How old are you?” I asked her. It was something I personally vowed never to ask her because I had said it didn’t matter. Now, I realized it only didn’t matter so long as I could make her like me. Since that was clearly out of the question, all promises made based on that presumption were null. She told me to guess her age. I started at 30 even though I thought she looked 28. I eventually learned she was 35 which I have to admit was much older than I imagined her being. Was this why she didn’t like me, I wondered to myself. “Do I seem like a kid to you?” I asked her. “Yes,” she said, “a little.” 

Finally I took her back home. As the car was idling in front of her house, she told me she hoped I would think long and hard about reality. I nodded but knew I would do no such thing. Reality is what you get when your dreams die and you lose hope. Fuck reality. 

Now I have to deal with the fact that I have fallen in love with Jiwon and all of a sudden her age seems incredibly important in this fact. A new option has been added to the wheel of insecurity. Together with insecurities associated with my skin, my height, my personality, my occupational choice, my wealth, I must now include my age. Does she think I am too young? Or is age her excuse to mask a dissonance which is more fundamental. What about me? When I was 4 she was 15. Does that matter? Why would a 24 year old man want to be with a 35 year old woman? The question seems insulting to both of us, the way it reduces us to entities exclusively represented and defined by two digit numbers. I did not notice her age when I saw her. I only saw something in her—something I still cannot fully explain—that I did not see in other woman. I always thought it was a partially preternatural maturity, but with this information I am forced to wonder if it was preternatural at all.

Topic Outline: Sexuality, Choice, and Bisexual Erasure

1. Do both gay and straight people have an incentive to deny the reality of bisexual identity?

2. Are gay and generally queer people “Born This Way”? Is the claim that they are homophobic? Are there other issues with the assumptions of this gay-rights argument?

3. In what ways is choice present in deciding sexual orientation (and not merely sexual behavior or sexual identity)?

Outside Questions:

Do concerns with identity politics distract us from issues associated with economic power structures and the organization of political systems?

Can we establish analogies between issues of sexual identity and issues of gender identity?

Miseducation of a Physicist: Topic Outline
Before I write this work I need to develop some sort of outline to organize the topics contained within it. My guess is that I need at least a dozen chapters to justify turning this thing into a book. 

1. Missing Curriculum in Problem Solving Education

2. False Dichotomy between Questions and Answers

3. What does it mean to understand?
Levels of understanding: There is no absolute level of understanding; just increasing depths of understanding; Your goal is to move deeper. 
Difference between expert and Novice

4. How to Develop a Wide Investigation
Begin with a large problem?
Begin with a small problem? The headlights theory of work. 


I tell myself that regardless of how this turns out at least I’ll probably get a good story out of it. It seems slightly sociopathic to me, to reduce your experiences to fodder for your writing. But in my more honest moments I know that reality is not just material for my work, but that my work represents my best attempts to cope with reality.

Deconstructing Sexual Orientation
Sexual orientation is indeed influenced by choice. There are a few factors which are relevant here. When people talk about sexual orientation of people being fixed they are doing so in an imprecise way which connects sexual orientation to the reality of objects in the universe. 

First the reality of objects in the universe is not something we connect to as truth. 

Second sexual orientation as not cleanly associated with our 
Sexuality is biologically important but it is also culturally important and. The 

The reason sexual orientation cannot be separated from choice is that it is experienced rather than observed, and a person’s experiences cannot be divorced from the choices they have made. Consequently there can be no universal measure of sexual orientation, because my experiences and their associated interpretations are not the same as your experiences and associated interpretations. 

Our individual understanding of sexual orientation is socially constructed and also individually interpreted, and social circumstances and interpretations which are indeed directly affected by the choices we make can thus certainly indirectly affect sexual orientation.

Unlike sexual phenotype which is (in most cases) observably binary, sexual orientation does not display a phenotype and is instead an experiential identity rather than a physical identity. That is sexual orientation is something people experience rather than something they directly observe through sense. Observations themselves require some interpretation to understand and incorporate into our observed reality, and this is ever more true for experiences. Person A and person B may experience (in some theoretically absolute and objective sense, that we cannot yet measure) the same thing, but the meaning of this experience would not be the same for Person A and Person B. Sexual orientation, or what we understand of it, is not associated nakedly with experience but is defined more precisely as the meaning people extrapolate from this experience. 

As a more relevant example Man A and Man B can display the same level of sexual attraction (again in some absolute and objective sense we cannot measure) to Man C. Man A could say this attraction indicates that he is gay and Man B could say his attraction indicates that he is heterosexual and both would be perfectly correct in saying so.


Thus it is improper to claim that a woman with an apparently predominate sexual attraction to other women, is living a lie. The claim involves us interpreting (what we understand) of her sexual experience for her, and thus represents the very thing gay-rights advocates claimed was morally wrong. 

It is impossible to perceive reality without observation, and it is impossible to make use of observations without interpretation. But our interpretations of reality are not human-independent qualities (i.e., not fundamental qualities of the world) and hence our interpretation of the reality we observe is not fixed. Instead the way we interpret reality is dependent on experiences which build us in certain directions of understanding reality. 

The “choice—not a choice” dichotomy is a false one and an unhelpful one. Sexuality is both dependent on things we choose and things we do not choose. And anyway it is largely beside the point. Certain manifestations of sexuality are OK and should not be prosecuted/vilified independent of whether or not people have made the choice to identify with them. 

I understand the necessity of adopting certain political arguments at certain times in order to make the incremental steps toward social progress, but we should always look beyond the politically advantageous arguments of the moment in order to determine what is true or untrue about the social construction of our world. 

Liberals are just as brainwashed as conservatives. Anyone thinking about the “born this way” argument for a few minutes would see problems with it, but most liberals did not think this way. They simply adopted the position (and then worked fervently to prove it) after it was handed down by media and political elites. 


———

As a very elementary example. 


The chair would be part of reality in some absolute sense of truth, but it would not be part of our inherently subjective reality. To us the chair would not exist, because we could not observe it. 


The analogy which relates understanding a language to sexual orientation is quite good, because there are aspects of our sexual identity which we certainly can choose or choose not to explore and after we have explored these aspects our identity has expanded in ways it can no longer contract. (In much the same way that having learned English as a first language, after a certain point, means you will always understand english.)

We still need to deal with homophobia. Not in the naked ways its displayed in sports and or caricatured conservative media channels, but also in the ways liberals discuss sexuality and the way both men and women feel about the bisexual identity of either gender.

Statistical Physics of the Permutation Group
I’ve thought of a new focus for the thermal permutations project. I think I’ll call it “Statistical Physics of the Permutation Group”. I think the title is simple and it is catchy. The word “group” might be too abstract (and could consequently turn off some people), but I think I can write the abstract and the introduction in a sufficiently general fashion to make it interesting to biologists and possibly anyone interested in mathematical modeling of abstracted biological systems. Beginning with a biological focus and then moving toward a mathematical will hopefully not split me between two groups. 

This would require me to give a more mathematical introduction to permutations and to couch some of the colloquial terminology in a more abstract language but I think the benefits are worth it. My only fear is that I give the work the veneer of mathematical abstraction without making deep contact with anything truly mathematical. I think I would need to learn a bit about the permutation group and permutations (from textbooks which discuss these subjects) before I discuss this in any deep detail. 

Basic questions
What is a group?
What is a permutation?
What is statistical physics?
Can this be extended to field theory? (Statistical field theory)

From Orwell’s “Politics and the English Language”
A scrupulous writer,
in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus: 
What am I trying to say? 
What words will express it? 
What image or idiom will make it clearer? 
Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? 

And he will probably ask himself two more:
Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly? 



Hi Virginia, 

How is your cold? Are you feeling better today? Hope you get better soon. :)

I'd like to know how renewal DS-2019 is going.
As you know, the date of my departure is 18 November.
I want to bring new DS-2019, but if it is difficult, please let me know when I can get the document by post. 
I need to buy a return ticket and make a reservation to get a visa interview with the US embassy, but I cannot make these things now.


Hi Virginia, 

I’m leaving Harvard this Friday, and I’m wondering how the renewal of the DS-2019 is going? (I need the  new DS-2019 in order to go through my visa interview with the US embassy and ultimately return to the US). I apologize for asking this after your convalescence last week.  Would it be easier to ask someone in the Harvard’s international office about this? Or I could get the DS-2019 document by mail while in Korea if that works better. 

Please let me know what works for you. 

Best,
Jiwon

Time

I think it is fair to say physics cannot currently provide a clear and unambiguous description of time. It is thus not surprising perhaps that all our physical theories are defined in terms of time as an ubiquitous parameter: any theory would of course be limited by and irreducible beyond its least understandable unit. 

Some might ask what is there to understand? Time is simply what is. It marks our years, situates history, gives meaning to our lived through memory. Time to us (and all living things) is much like water to a fish, we move through it and cannot live without it. And yet unlike Baldwin’s proverbial fish and its water, we humans are ever conscious of time. Even when we lose track of it, we return to a cognizance which borders on preoccupation and mania. We want more of it even as we squander what we already have. We move faster and faster believing time slows in comparison, only to discover that it too was racing with us (and even outpaced us) and we seemingly have less time than we did before the race began.

A world without time is a static rendering of our world with time. It is one in which time exists but instead of flowing continuously, has chosen a specific point to exist for all…well, time. A world in which time had never existed is incomprehensible to us. We can imagine living in a world of two dimensions and can even stretch our imagination to consider a world of eleven or more dimensions, but to consider worlds where time is not relevant does not make sense, for our entire understanding of the physical world depends on our meager understanding of time.

Hemmed in by Dreams

Last night as I walked home, I thought about Stokes theorem and Gaussian integrals. Rather, I didn’t think about the specifics of the work itself but of what the work would mean. I thought about showing the work to Matthew Reece and coauthoring a paper with him. I thought about how it would look to post-doctoral fellowship committees if I had done first-author work in two different fields of physics. I thought about awards and the first steps to a MacArthur fellowship. And then, I stopped myself. I had been here before, ensconced by dreams which paint futures so beautiful that I drift from the present and thus no longer trouble myself with the details which can bring the dreams into fruition. For as surely as they can provide hope and motivation, dreams can suffocate and drown. The danger is that if one spends too long imagining the contours of some day yet to come, time is taken away from the plans and actions which create those contours, one is pulled from the struggle and uncertainty, both unbearable and absolutely necessary, which could make manifest for all what had only previously existed to one. 

I have spent a year (or more) dreaming of this work with Gaussian integrals and Stokes theorem, believing that I had just not yet learned enough in order to make those musings real. And yet I have done little to move forward beyond those dreams. I have remained static and yet unmoored, in place and yet drifting. So as I walked home last night I soon found my dream being supplanted with fear, the fear that all these dreams would ever come to is what they already are.

The tragedy of this prospect—that my ideas and thoughts will be born and will die within me—urged me to consider how easily these visions of future work could be corrupted by a surface level focus on what the work could mean for “the self”. The ego is ever manipulating one into believing that its completion lies beyond the current horizon and thus that anything which exists in the here and now is insignificant, unimportant. I have recognized many similar lies in the past and have managed to free myself from them long enough to prove them wrong in actions if not through argument. Now, the challenge is to do so again, to recognize these dreams for what they are, not songs imbuing me with courage and intent but sirens pulling me into the shallows of a rocky coast.

November 24, 2016 — Thursday 9:15 PM

The crux of this work rests on the general idea that any non-equilibrium process (whether biological or not) in contact with a heat bath has certain constraints on heat exchanges as can be derived from a generalized second law of thermodynamics. This generalized second law includes the typical heat changes for the system and the surrounding bath, but includes an additional term which defines the entropy change due to the irreversibility of the process. 

The paper asserts that the applicability of these ideas to self-replication rests on the ability to precisely define a “self” in a system according to a coarse graining of microstates. Such an explicit definition of a “self” then allows one to track probabilistically the dynamics of that self through time using the methods of non-equilibrium statistical physics. 

The paper concludes by hoping that the work can lead to future developments which explore the connection between natural selection and non-equilibrium systems. 


Comments


\tbf{Experimental Probing on \refew{}:} Common sense notions of heat changes might lead us to believe that the heat released in a thermal process should only be a function of the forward reaction rate. \refew{} contradicts such notions and if it is indeed true there should be a way to devise an experiment testing it. That is is there a way that one could fix the forward reaction rate for a process, modulate the reverse reaction rate, and then observe variations in the heat released?
\tbf{Heat and Irreversibility:} The connection between heat and irreversibility posited in \refew{}, stems from the paper . In the paper this connection seems to be posited more as a definition/assertion rather than a result derived from the foundations of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. This is not to say that the result is wrong; only that it perhaps needs to be placed on a firmer footing. 
\tbf{Definition of Macroscopic Transition Amplitude:} The main theoretical work of the paper \refew{england_equation} rests on the definition of the macroscopic transition amplitude provided in \refew{}. Conceptually, it consists of averaging over the probability of a transition from one initial microstate to a final microstate weighted by the probability to be in the initial microstate. The averaging occurs over the space of states. I have never seen such a definition of a macroscopic transition amplitude and it would help make these results more rigorous if such a definition existed. 
\tbf{Renormalization Group:} The connection between microscopic and macroscopic scales seems akin to the basic ideas of the renormalization group, namely whether the second law of thermodynamics for non-equilibrium statistical physics takes on a different (transition amplitude dependent form) when we move from one length scale (i.e., the microscopic system) to a larger length scale (i.e., the macroscopic system). 
\tbf{Non-Traditional Definition of Path Average:} The paper references a path average in its definition \refew{}, but never explicitly writes one out. Intuitively, if I were to average a quantity over all paths connecting some initial state to some final state I would end up writing something which looks like a path integral. Would such a mathematical definition make this work more concrete? What would such a path integral look like?
\tbf{Case of $\delta> g$:} If we consider \refew{}, in the case where $\delta<g$ (a population which dies faster than it grows) we find that the total entropy change of the universe (that is both the bath represented by $\beta\Delta q$ and the system represented by $\Delta s_{\text{int}}$) is less than zero which contradicts the second law of thermodynamics. Whether such a result proves fatal to this formalism is contingent on whether \refew{} can be applied in the case of an exponentially dying population (Although I do not see why it can’t). 
\tbf{Bacterial Cell Division:} In Section \ref{}, I outlined the calculation for the reverse transition amplitude in bacterial cell division as faithful to the text as possible. However, the process which is claimed to define the $\mathbf{II}$ to $\mathbf{I}$ transition seems convoluted and unnatural. I think a more careful analysis of the factors relevant to cell division would need to be undertaken to in order to properly apply this formalism to the example provided in the paper. 

Student Poster Comments

Kirstin: 
The font-size is too large. Text density on some posters is often unfortunately too high, but with your chosen text size you’ll be bordering the other extreme. You won’t be able to fit any detailed information with your given text size.

Poster template: I’m guessing this text size problem comes from starting with a keynote/powerpoint slide rather than a poster template in keynote/powerpoint format. The two have different text defaults owing to their different display sizes. On a 48 width by 36 height poster, you a text size between 24 and 48 font works
The poster would benefit from more organization, specifically an introduction/motivation which explains the intent of the presentation. 



Anna
Be careful with the distance between text and images. 
Procedural steps should be written as a numbered list. 
The derivation image in the Data and Results section should be removed or replaced with the single relevant equation and its associated description. 
Some of your poster seems to have been “copy-and-pasted” from your presentation slides. This is fine to give you a sense of where the information belongs, but you should think carefully about how best to convey the information in this new context. (It should actually be easier to do so since, in comparison to slides in talks, what is written on a poster is expected to be read in more detail)
The overall design is fine, although I’m not sure how necessary the color gradation in the background is.  

Constantin
Font sizes for all plots should be larger. (Make them slightly smaller than the text size)
Body text should not be centered
(Potentially obvious) If you include box with the title “Goal” or “Conclusion” make sure to explicitly and clearly state what the goal and the conclusion.
Make sure you include some text in the results section explaining the plot. 
Is the Origins of Life Initiative a Harvard supported group? If so, you should say so.
Otherwise good design. 

Francesca
Your abstract is intimidatingly long. You should shorten it and move additional material to a new introductory section. 
Font size is bordering on too small. I think this might be because you’re trying to include too much information/pictures.
Be careful with the distance between text and images. 
Otherwise good design. 

Charlotte
Design is good: clean and easy to read. 
Font size is bordering on too large. If you’re going to include more information beyond what’s presented in the outline (and you should) the font size should be somewhat smaller. 
Body text should not be centered
Introduction: I’ve never heard of a SASER, and the name alone seems cool, but make sure you explain it in the body of the poster as well. (It wasn’t in your class presentation if I remember correctly)




Josh
Design is good: clean and easy to read. 
The title is somewhat misleading. Global warming has a specific modern usage which is different from your usage in the poster.
Font size is bordering on too small. At the level of a poster presentation, it should be possible to increase the font-size without having to exclude any absolutely necessary information. 
I like the usage of the five simplified steps in the introduction. If you decide to include them in the final version, make sure you explain each step in more detail somewhere in the poster. 
Otherwise good design

Katie
Font size is too small. At the level of this poster presentation, it should be possible to increase the font-size without having to exclude any absolutely necessary information. 
You should include an introduction/motivation explaining why a physicist (who is not a particle physicist) would care about a single-top control region. 

Elgin
Something went terribly wrong with your layout. The fonts and images are overlapping in many places. 
For the easels we’ll be using, the width of the poster is 48 inches and the height is 36 inches. 
Careful with the jargon. What is understandable to the general microbiologist is not typically understandable to the general physicist. 
You should include an introduction/motivation explaining why a physicist (who is not a biological physicist) would care about this work

Andrew
Good Poster Design. It has appropriate sized fonts and a clean, easy to read layout. 


Tommy
Design is good: clean and easy to read. 
Good choice of figure in first column, but the labels should be larger. And if you are going to keep the numbers in the figure, make sure you include a paragraph or textbox explaining what the numbers are. 
You switch to a different fontsize in the second column. All body text should have a consistent font
Even though you didn’t do the scientific work yourself, your name should be under title


Gray
Including the Randal-Sundrum Graviton in the introduction is good. In the subsequent plots, make sure to point out how the data indicates that it is excluded from the region you’ve searched. 
Good additional labels in the first figure in the second column. If space permits, you should do the other data plots (i.e., essentially, explaining how to read them)
Otherwise good design

Shadi
You don’t need to derive the Compton formula on the poster
Figure in the bottom of the second column and at the top of the third column are too small. After you make them larger, make sure their text labels/legends are also clearly visible. 
Don’t copy and past LaTeX references. It’s possible to write the references directly onto the poster. 
Otherwise good design

Noah 

The boxes as they are arranged in the white background seem somewhat disorganized. There isn’t any consistency to the white space separating adjacent blocks. The “Discussion” and “References” sections, for example, are separated by an arbitrarily large amount of white space. 
Variations in text size: the text size for the body should be consistent throughout. The text in the “Renormalization Group Analysis” box would be appropriate for the body text of the poster. The other size is a little too large.
The borders around the text within the box is too large


Hayley 
Be careful with the spacing between text and images and border boxes. (See your image in first column and bottom image in second column)
The basic “black text on a white background design” is somewhat plain. Giving the header a background color (a not too loud one) could help, also including more than just lines of text (perhaps bullet points or tables?) within each box.

Conclusion to Time

In the same way General Relativity did not really change Newtonian Gravitation, but allowed us to understand how Newtonian Gravitation is corrected at high energy densities, if someone were to somehow develop a more fundamental theory of time it likely would not change any of our existing physical theories which depend on time, but it would certainly change the way we understand and interpret them. Einstein at the beginning of the 20th century, by revealing that time’s passage is not absolute and eternal the way previous physical theories had always assumed, made the first major step beyond Isaac Newton to supplement our understanding of time. Indeed today, it is only theories that contain relativity that incorporate any non-intuitive definition of time.  Consequently, a reasonable conjecture concerning our understanding of time is that if we were to develop an even more fundamental theory of gravity, then our notions of time would be further corrected. However, this best guess is somewhat like the man who searches for his keys in the lamp light because that is where he could best see. Rather its possible a better theory of time could come from a direction completely orthogonal to our expectations. In any case the only way we could progress in developing such a theory is by asking questions which could move us closer to it. 

Questions concerning modern physics and time

Quantum Gravity and Time: How does string theory change/supplement our understanding of time? How generally might a theory of quantum gravity change our understanding of time?

Quantum Mechanics and Time: Quantum Mechanics treats time much like other classical physical theories do (i.e., as a parameter), except for the case of measurement of a quantum state. Does this property of quantum systems lead to any novel questions concerning time?

Information and Time: The second law of thermodynamics asserts that the entropy of the universe increases in time. If physicists developed a more fundamental theory of entropy, perhaps through the second law of thermodynamics, our understanding of time would be corrected as well. 

Multiverses and the 2nd Law: Moreover, relativity asserts that the passage of time is relative. Would it be possible to imagine a scenario where non-causally separated multiverses, can observe each other violating the second law of thermodynamics?

Permutation and Symmetric Groups
So I’m going to keep the title of the work: “Statistical Physics of Permutations”. My intended title “Statistical Physics of the Permutation Group” is not exactly accurate because there is no the permutation group, that is, there is no single permutation group. First, in the work my space of states is actually isomorphic to the symmetric group, the group consisting of all permutations of a set of N elements. Thus the more accurate title would be “Statistical Physics of the Symmetric Group”, but I think this would turn off anyone who doesn’t understand the underlying meaning behind the term symmetric group. What a permutation group actually refers to is a subgroup of the symmetric group. For example, the symmetric group of the set {1,2,3} are the permutations 
(123) which take 1 to 2, 2 to 3,  and 3 to 1; 
(132) which take 1 to 3, 3 to 2, and 2 to 1; 
(1)(23) which take 1 to 1, 2 to 3, and 3 to 2; 
(12)(3) which take 1 to 2, 2 to 1, and 3 to 3; 
(2)(31) which take 1 to 3, 2 to 2, and 3 to 1; 
(1)(2)(3) which take 1 to 1, 2 to 2, and 3 to 3. 

a permutation group of this set could instead simply be the permutations
(1)(2)(3) which take 1 to 1, 2 to 2, and 3 to 3.
(1)(23) which take 1 to 1, 2 to 3, and 3 to 2;
This group has an inverse (each permutation is its own inverse), an identity element (the first permutation is the identity), is closed (composing the two permutations results in one of the other permutations), and obeys associativity (multiplying three permutations in any order results in the same net permutation). So these permutations certainly define a group, but they are not the kind of group you’re exploring in your work. 

To be mathematically explicit, it would be appropriate to claim that you’re looking at a simple statistical physics model where the space of states for n lattice sites is isomorphic to the symmetric group of degree n, and where the hamiltonian is a function of the deviation of each permutation from the identity permutation. I don’t think this definition is particularly helpful to the work, unless someone were seeking to generalize it mathematically. 

“ For the Paper:
To be mathematically explicit, we considered a simple statistical physics model where the space of states for $n$ lattice sites was isomorphic to the symmetric group of degree $n$, and where the energy of each permutation was a function of how much the permutation the deviates from the identity permutation.
“

I think I should write a module on all this. Terms to include are symmetric group, permutation group, order, degree. 

Examples of permutation groups with four element sets (From wikipedia)?

Jiwon and Tony 
About a week ago, Jiwon returned to Korea. She’ll be there for about a month (she tells me), visiting family and friends and getting her visa in order before she comes back to the states. When she returns to the U.S., she’ll stay here for some more months until June before going back to Korea for the foreseeable future. I tell myself that all of this is OK. We’re friends and my affinity towards her arises more from my loneliness than anything substantial between us. Moreover, two weeks ago I was contemplating abandoning her, cutting her out of my life the way I have done to so many others. The problem was the common one for me: the relationship had reached a crescendo where the individual investments of each person were no longer the same. I was frustrated, an emotion which took all of my past experiences with girls like and unlike Jiwon and propagated them to the present to effect this new relationship. She had told me she saw me as a friend, that phrase coincident with eternal damnation which sends me to cognitive homicidal spaces I never thought I could occupy. And yet she still wanted to text me every day she still wanted to eat dinner with me. For her the relationship was comfortable, something to stay her mind as she lived in a foreign country. For me the relationship was torture and I felt the pressing need to escape. 

My way of escaping was to fade out. It is not at all my style. I prefer explicitness and directness but I employed that with Lesley, and it did not stop her from ignoring me whenever we saw each other months later. I was also honest with Jessica and months down the line I was fortunate enough to see her sticking her tongue down Makai’s throat. Not to say that there was certainly some causal relationship between the two events, but the mind associates what it will.  So honesty and seriousness, being unappreciated by my past relationships, seemed naively circumspect now. Instead, she texted me and I did not reply. She sent me an email and I did not read it. We were supposed to go to the planetarium in the science museum, but I was finding being around her was toxic to my self esteem, and I used all my memories of shame and frustration in her presence to bolster my resolve to avoid her. 

Alas it was not enough. Two days into this defection, days spent combatting encroaching waves of depression with the ever ineffective tools of binge watching and binge eating, she texted me saying she was getting worried about me. I guess this softened something in me. I texted her back saying I was OK, and adding, disingenuously, that I was sorry I made her worry. I had thought I had made a decision concerning Jiwon and my relationship and here I was reneging on that decision. 

I tried to rationalize my self-betrayal. The roadblock in my understanding of Jiwon was that I could not fathom how a girl could like spending time with a guy but have no interest in developing a romantic or sexual relationship with the guy. The resolution, or the pretended resolution, came from accepting that the misunderstanding was basically sexist as it assumed that male-female relationships were different from male-male or female-female relationships. I mean I had many guy friends who I had absolutely no interest in pursuing a sexual relationship with. Was it really so strange to find that a girl saw me in the same way?

So during the last week Jiwon was here, we continued to spend time together. We ate dinner. We spoke. We walked through the brisk October roads of a Cambridge Fall. And all the while I told myself that this was OK. The story about unattractive but nice men who women keep around for emotional support, did not apply to me and Jiwon (I claimed) for it was a story created to explain the lives of other people. But at the same time, I felt Jiwon drifting away. In her presence, I found myself still vaguely annoyed and waiting for whatever we were doing to be over so I could just get away. I had long ago stopped being so consistent in walking her to the bus stop, and now even our conversations were flagging. 

I was going through the motions, pretending to care. Unquestionably there was an increased sense of power in this. Selective apathy is always empowering specifically for the mental room it frees up to focus on other things. I had begun to realize that Jiwon, her claims to the contrary, was in a way taking advantage of me. My judgment of the typical American male may be unfairly low, but I believe most other men would have dropped Jiwon a long time ago after realizing that she was not physically receptive to her touch let alone sexually receptive. And yet here I was still paying attention to her and taking her places for months like she was my girlfriend. My view of all this would have been more charitable if I were a more honorable person, different still if I was not yearning for a positive sexual experience with a girl, but I was not honorable and I desperately wanted sex and so I accepted this quiet torture while simultaneously hating Jiwon for prioritizing her comfort over mine. 

And I think this is why a part of my mind eventually abdicated whatever responsibilities it previously believed it had toward Jiwon. On her last day here, we ate dinner in the law school bar. I bought her dinner and bought her a beer as well. She accepted these gifts with less protest than usual. She said she would pay me back when she returned to Cambridge. I then walked her to the coop and bought a copy of Einstein’s Dreams. On the front page I copied from memory the poem I had written (but never given) her a month ago

I have taken you to the ocean
and I wish I can take you to the moon
but for now it is too far away.
So as we wait for a better hour
here is a book
To help you dream about time
As I dream about you. 

When I handed her the book, she saw the title, and remembered the lessons between us and laughed. It was a few days later that she actually saw the writing on the first page. “Thank you” she texted me “for the beautiful poem.” 

My experience with Jiwon has not made me a better person. I am more cynical even though she has done nothing to me (certainly nothing approaching the passive mendacities of previous relationships) other than not return my affection. But perhaps that is why I’m cynical. I had claimed to know that you cannot make anyone like you; all you can do is show yourself to them, give them time, and then allow them to come to the decision on their own of what to do next. It is never your decision, no matter the manner of machinations you implement to confuse yourself of this fact. They always have final say. I had implemented this philosophy as best as I could with Jiwon, taking her places, eating dinner with her, talking with her, simply being around her and maintaining a non-committal perspective which constantly assured me that these experiences, divorced from any supposedly natural conclusion, were enough. The outcome did not matter for here Jiwon and I were in a present which could be appreciated independent of whatever future it led to. But I could not assume the required level of detachment to be OK with the direction the future pointed to. Here was another girl who liked me enough to smile and laugh, but did not like me enough to do anything more. And so the more time I spent with her, the more annoyed I became that nothing more was happening. I was becoming thoroughly disenchanted with her, and was trying to find ways to replace her (much like I had been trying to find ways to replace Tony) while not fully conveying to her the fact she had lost my esteem. It may be true that you cannot force anyone to like you but it seemed you also could not force yourself to not be offended when they show you that they don’t. 

Perhaps my sense of the natural trajectory of a relationship is all wrong. Isn’t that really where all this frustration is coming from? From a mismatch between my expectations for reality and the way reality manifests? If I believed that it took six months rather than six days for a girl to let you touch her and a single year, rather than a single month for her to sleep with you, would not my anger be judged as some unreasonable impatience? But then again I know this relative understanding of time is a slippery slope because it can lead one to presume a time scale for things which does not in fact exist. To be frank, what I feel many of my peers are lacking is a sense of urgency, a recognition that they, although young, are decaying a little each day and that some time in the not so far future their lives will be over and yet still unspent. 

Unsurprisingly she has texted me less since she’s been in Korea. Texts which had come every day, now come once every few days. Thus I am led to interpret her previous behavior as a consequence of convenience. I was here in Cambridge with her, and so she contacted me so frequently because I was so constantly in her sight and thus also similarly constantly in her mind. But displaced in space and separated in the diurnal clock by ten hours, we now effectively occupy different physical spaces of reality. So whatever convenience which made our previous relationship easy is now supplanted by a temporal and spatial barrier which makes any continued relationship difficult. More fairly, I am not assigning my previous time with her the value it certainly deserves. It was not inevitable, for if it was it surely would have happened to me before. Rather, I have never had a relationship with anyone (except Tony) which has approximated my relationship with Jiwon. 

“Do you think you know me?” I asked her, during our last dinner together. The question was odd, but it was purposeful. I was thinking back to all the conversations we had when she told me that I did not really know her. My affected distance and my decision, shortly thereafter abdicated, to avoid her made me realize that she probably knew me less than she thought. 

“I think I know 0.02 percent of you,” she answered. This was a surprisingly low answer given the amount of time we spent together. But it was likely accurate. I probably even knew comparatively less about her. 

“Do you want to know more about me?” I asked her. The question was arguably an easy one, but as always she read contours into it that I did not expect, and was quiet for a few seconds while she thought of an answer. 

“Do you want me to know more about you?” she responded finally. 

“You answered my question with a question.” I reprimanded. “But the more important question,” I said, “is ‘Do you want to know more about me?’ ”

She thought for another moment and said “I want to know more…about your future.”

“Why?”

“Because you are young. A lot of things can happen.”

Jiwon and I have different understandings of time. She is 35 years old, so she, only somewhat facetiously, sees herself as old. My insecurities pull me toward one interpretation of her responses to me, and my understanding of her own insecurities pull me toward another. Perhaps it’s not because of my personality, my attractiveness, or my height. Maybe she sees me as too young and would feel ashamed to date someone who was learning to read while she was going through puberty? (How perfectly karmic is this prospect considering all the guys I turned down for being closer to my dad’s age than mine?) So I feel that she doesn’t completely understand how trivial that time difference is when viewed from the larger time scale of the entirety of a human life. Jiwon and I both have roughly three or four score years on this planet, many years of which will be spent in loneliness and silence, bereft of that relational communion so supposedly necessary to the human condition. And so if you manage to find one person who can replace that loneliness and that silence, with laughter and warmth you should recognize the opportunity for what it is and not squander it due to fears which are trivial in comparison. 

And yet I recognize hypocrisy in this exhortation, for my own fears hold me back as surely as I think Jiwon’s potential fears do. And most of these fears extend from my recent experience with Tony, an experience which Jiwon was supposed to help me forget and which she only helped me realize the folly of trying to forget. Tony’s disappearance killed something in me, some last vestige of hope in other people, in relationships, in life with another person. My unilateral pursuit of sex with Jiwon was mostly my reaction to this self-death; believing a relationship was not possible, I sought what I could. It was all because my closest relationship with another person had transformed over night into a silence I could not explain nor anticipate, and the fact that I could not anticipate it was evidence enough that my understanding of the world was too incomplete to act as any sort of foundation for faith in other people. People were in fact elaborately constructed black boxes, and I, my beliefs to the contrary, could not predict their behavior. But I could, I believed, use them as surely as they had used me. 

But it seems Tony did not disappear. To give myself some control over a silence I could not at all control, I had added Tony’s number to my spam list so that I would not constantly check my phone expecting his call. The strategy worked. After a few weeks I stopped jumping with hope whenever my phone vibrated or beeped. He was ever steadily becoming a memory. But two days ago, I checked my spam folder to discover to messages from him. One sent on November 15th (“Hi Mobi. How are you?”) and the other sent on November 23rd (“Hi Mobo. Are you in Boston?”). I lost my breath when I saw these messages. I had expected to never hear from Tony again; when people disappear the way Tony did, they usually do not come back. And yet here he was. 

I was still skeptical about how “here” he was. I needed some answers to questions formulated and forgotten two months ago. I called him later that night and he told me he was in Boston. I drilled him with questions, interrogating his vanishing, trying to come to an understanding which was too late to save the version of me who had already been lost to the vacuum. “I called you and texted you the week before you left. What happened?” He told me his phone had water damage and so his texts/calls with people were somewhat choppy and many hadn’t apparently gone through. He said he had sent me a text message which I had clearly not received. Should I believe him? I asked myself. No was the rational answer, but yes was the answer I needed and chose. My conception of reality had tilted discernibly in the weeks after Tony’s disappearance. Not only did my judgment of our relationship change, my entire perception of people and the social world I occupied had become slightly darker. So I more than welcomed the prospect of returning to a more generous and less distrustful relationship with the world. It would, I realized (or at least hoped), make the uphill climb of daily life a little less steep. 

He told me how his job in Florida was going. That first week there he was learning about his new work and after that first week he was given assignment after assignment. He told me he had spent many late nights in his office during that first month getting up to speed with the new framework of the company and that he was still only 60-70% there. During that time, he had apparently foregone most relationships, and it was only much later that he thought to ask what happened to all of his friends. For example, he said he texted me about a month ago, another text I never received, another text which could have saved me from descending as far I had into despair. 

But he was here now, and he wanted to see me while he was in Boston. I was reluctant to agree to this. This conversation had already given me the most of what I could ever again get from Tony: closure. Months of dreaming about him with no supposed course to act on those dreams had left his image cold and desiccated,  and now I couldn’t help believing that any future meeting between us would mean much less to me than this more fundamental realization that he had not intentionally left me without notice. And this may be due to my new found cynicism—a cynicism which extended from Tony’s disappearance and was unfortunately not reduced by his reappearance—but I don’t think I have the emotional bandwidth to do anything other than pantomime the intimacy I felt so authentically months ago. Tony is returning to Miami tomorrow, and I told him I would meet him today. I told him this not because I had any plans to actually meet him, but only so he would stop asking and also wouldn’t unexpectedly show up at my house. I realize this is somewhat unlike me, or at least unlike who I thought I was months ago. I was rarely so duplicitous, so indifferent to potential human pain. The irony of these circumstances seems appropriate—that my belief in a changed world would have plunged me into an unfounded despair out of which I would emerge a different man into a world which had not in fact changed at all. Indeed I think life could be reduced to a series of ironies, both tragic and dramatic and leagues between, meted out so constantly that we can rarely see or appreciate them. 

What remains now is a decision concerning the relationship I will have with my pain. James Baldwin wrote that the reason people hold on so fervently to their hate is perhaps because they realize that once hate is gone they will have to deal with pain. But why do people hold on so fervently to their pain? Is it because they realize that once pain is gone, they will have to deal with the undeniable fact of their irrelevance to the world? Maybe with the loss of their pain—or rather with the loss of their right to their pain, with the loss of their sense of justice for which their pain is merely a corollary—people are forced to admit that the truth of themselves and their relationships, indeed the truth of their entire effective world, is not what they had always believed it was, and that in fact there is nothing about our world which demands that it be terribly concerned with human suffering.

Elgin’s work

FOXC2 is a transcription factor significantly involved in valve formation in lymphatic vessels. Transcription factors control the production of other proteins, and we used lymphatic cells conforming to L-shaped chips to look at the structural changes that would be brought through perturbing this control. 

The second sentence should explicitly reference FOXC2 in some way in order to establish logical continuity with the subject of the first sentence. 

The phrase ‘other proteins’ is vague. I imagine there are a specific set/type of proteins which are relevant to your study. 

The word ‘perturbing’ is somewhat formal. And it has different meanings in different areas of physics. ‘Changing’, ‘varying’, or ‘modulating’ is better. 

The phrase ‘this control’ is vague. You should mention specifically what you were perturbing (the expression of the transcription factor FOXC2, I imagine) and also how you were modifying it. 

The conclusion should reference again what FOXCS, and LECs are (as in “In the absence of the transcription factor FOXC2, lymphatic endothelial cells show increased cortical stiffness.”) Also mentioning what this conclusion means/implies more generally will lend it more importance to the reader. 

The title and bullet points for “Novel Approach” should form a coherent sentence. Start with “We used L-Patterned Microchips to Analyze:…” And for the two bullet points the most salient points are “differences in cytoskeleton organization” and “stiffness and strength” so setting those two phrases apart from the rest of the text (with bold font, for example) would help an audience distill the main goals of the method. 

For “What’s Next” You should write a full sentence, which is specifically relevant to the figure you displayed.

Stokes Theorem Project Notes  11-28-2016
For the Stokes Theorem Project, the initial goal will be to find a way to express the discrete version of Stokes Theorem through Gaussian Integrals. This would require relating Differential Forms to Gaussian Integrals. Although this will be the initial goal, this would be of sufficient difficult to constitute the entire project. The subsequent goal would be to find some way to convert the resulting expression into a functional integral expression and thereby try to understand what implications Stokes Theorem can have on Quantum Field Theory. 

11-29-2016
One insight that just came to me today is that the Volume of a k-manifold is kind of like an annealed partition function where the domain of the parameters is finite and the probability distribution is uniform. I wonder if integration over a manifold is like integrating over a partition function which has annealed disorder. 

11-30-2016
An additional insight is that my previous consideration of a disordered (of a specifically annealed variety) harmonic oscillator chain might serve as a simple calculable model for the above note.

Forster’s Maurice
I’m reading Forster’s Maurice and I’m finding it more interesting than I had anticipated. What I had imagined to be a standard coming-of-age story for a man who discovers he is attracted to men is turning into a tragedy. Maurice, ignorant of the source of his feelings, gravitated to another young man, Clive. After so much time spent together, Clive told Maurice he loved him, to which Maurice responded with surprise and aversion. Their moments together abruptly ended and in that vacuum Maurice realized after several weeks that he too loved Clive. But it was apparently too late, for Clive had been avoiding him in the interim and was clearly set on doing so. One line stands out in all this. Maurice gets Clive alone, and is consequently reprimanded by him: “Stop this. You know being around you hurts me,” Clive says.

Is this the tragedy of which I speak? No, for this dance was really just a prelude for the relationship to come. Maurice confessed to Clive that he loved him too, and after some apparently feigned hesitation Clive called to Maurice and from their the affair began. 

It continued on well enough, with Maurice seemingly growing in self-assurance and agency from the mere affirmation of his love for Clive, and perhaps too from the reflection of that affirmation back at him. But this was not too last. Clive became sick (with pneumonia?) and after a period of convalescence he traveled to Greece to recoup. While he was sick, a distance had grown between him and Maurice, and during his travels Clive interrogated this growing separation and came to the unsettling conclusion that he was no longer attracted to men. Instead he found himself being pulled ever closer to women. 

He wrote this to Maurice in a letter to which Maurice responded with playful disbelief. The reality of Clive’s emotions did not settle upon Maurice until Clive returned to England and they spoke more extensively about what had happened to Clive. Clive didn’t really understand it, but he alone felt it, so the path forward was clearer to him than it was to Maurice who was left to wander in the dark of his confusion. 

I have not yet read beyond this point, but if this book has any reality to it, Maurice will be destroyed by the realization that one he loved so intensely no longer loves him. Or if Maurice is not destroyed, he will certainly be changed, and not necessarily for the better. 

But clearly I was wrong about this book. Couched as I am in the modern stories my culture tells itself of a binary sexuality, I had believed even stories from 100 years ago would reflect our general unwillingness to contend with the truth of our relationships. However, this is not so. Is Clive gay? Is he straight? Did he ever love Maurice?

“Not everyone who has worked with mathematical models in finance has been as sensitive to the importance of this methodology as Osborne was, which is one of the principal reasons why mathematical models have sometimes been associated with financial ruin. If you continue to trade based on a model whose assumptions have ceased to be met by the market, and you lose money, it is hardly a failure of the model. It’s like attaching a car engine to a plane and being disappointed when it doesn’t fly.”

Lies and Truth
After a while, Baldwin says, you admit you don’t know what the truth is, but you can tell what a lie is. Which, maybe, seems like a contradiction? Isn’t the truth, the opposite of a lie? So that if one can spot lies, shouldn’t one be able to state useful truths by simple inversions of the lie? Well, no, because what you consider to be the opposite of a lie depends on the axis (if any) on which you think the lie exists, and so the logical opposite of a lie could just as well be another lie. If I said “The republican party is the only party that can ensure the future of america,” and you were to label it as a lie (without clarifying what the future of america should be), would then the supposed opposite claim “The democratic party is the only party that can ensure the future of america,” be the truth? No, it would also be a lie. The more honest claim “No single party can ensure the future of america,” is closer to the truth, but could we definitively label it as “the truth”? 

How would we know? In each circumstance, we are riddled with uncertainties and it is our unwillingness to acknowledge these uncertainties through qualifications and contingencies which makes our claims untrue. So yes, lies are easily identifiable, and the truth (not always the opposite of a lie) remains forever elusive.

My Former Friends
I think it is fair to say it is sociopathic. I think about all my friendships (so called) from my undergraduate years, the people I shared rooms with, the people I ate countless dinners with, the people I built an against-code swing on the roofdeck of a boston brownstone. I see these people but I don’t see them, in a way, because I never really did see them, and what is left is an apparition of an apparition, twice faded, ever less real. I never really got to know them, these people I shared a house with for so many years, because I never let them get to know me. Bu this is partly untrue. The relation was one sided, one way, unidirectional. I think I saw them. I don’t think they saw me. And so when faced with the prospect of never seeing them again, my mind cannot help but be unconcerned. To feel neither nostalgia, or wist, neither loss, nor sorrow. There is just a vast chasm where some emotion should be. 

The part of me they know, the part of me I chose to show them, the part of me they connected with was only a sliver of that part of me some may call the real human identity. And so when my mind considers the prospect of seeing them again, what it considers more deeply is the prospect of returning to that position of self obscurity when I was hiding from myself the fact that I was hiding myself from others and that the first hiding was killing me even if the second hiding went on unnoticed. And so when I see these people, people who should have been my friends, people with whom I have an ostensible connection I don’t see them really, but I see the cage I would need to re enter in order to connect with the version of me they remember. I feel no animosity to that cage, it having kept me strangely simultaneously safe and trapped for so many years, but I have no attachment either and now that I no longer live within it, I do not want to return. So my former friends coupled, as unfortunately as they are, to my sense of a circumscribed and limited past are to me what I imagine shackles were to the captive, something to be contemplated from a distance, not a thing to be returned to with the intimacy and closeness afforded a thing which is innocuous and safe. 

I want to kill myself, but I cannot yet do so because there is work I must do and I have yet to do it. Do not lose your mind. Promise me Bolaji. Keep it together. I believe in you. I believe in you in so many directions you have even yet to realize.

December 6, 2016 - Tuesday 4:48 PM

I was impatient, and so I suffered the fate the impatient always suffer: to get what I wanted (when I want it,) but not precisely in the way I wanted it. 

[//]

There are often times when I am so gripped my some thought, a sequence of thoughts usually, which seems to inevitably lead to the conclusion that something is terribly wrong with my life. And this “something” always feels so important and urgent that I cannot for a time think of anything else. Until something else interrupts my thoughts and I forgot—sometimes forever—whatever it was that was so terribly wrong. 

[//]

Large Swaths of the Self
People often believe loneliness can be escaped through people, through some, any, community. But the loneliness they think they have escaped by finding a community is the loneliness they again must confront when they (have to come to terms with) the parts of themselves they must leave behind to find some collective communion with other people. 

In my more cynical moments, I had believed that such a decision would be easy for most people because people do not really want honesty—not from others, and certainly not from themselves. People want to know their place. People want to feel like they belong, and they will gladly cut away large swaths of their identity just to do so.

But I am now not so sure that this is true. I’m no longer sure that people find the process of personal abnegation so easy because I am no longer sure that such self-denial is completely possible. Instead I think what happens is a sort of squeezing and filling in; people pushing the conflicting parts of themselves deeper into the recesses of a hidden vault of personality, and letting the resulting space to be occupied by certain learned facades of character. And I don’t think the process is as explicitly conscious as I had believed. I now think it is so subtle, as to be of questionable materiality, for it proceeds in incremental steps through the seemingly safe conversations people have, the seemingly safe spaces we all occupy. Almost always the first step is made with the good intention of finding common ground, but the common ground exists at the surface where all men and women exist or have existed at a time, rather than within the deeper recesses that we all hide from each other. The bargain is made: If I pretend that I cannot see your shadow, will you pretend that you cannot see mine? You both agree not to acknowledge the question, and thus answer it by default and so the path is set, at least for a time, and you both are reduced in due proportion.

Sentences on Male Bisexuality


I have been trying to deconstruct our society’s modern view of bisexuality,

Imagine that a man was only willing to marry you so long as you stayed in the home and took care of his kids. This is fine, but imagine that it was socially acceptable for the man to think this, namely that the man could think this and still go on with his life believing he was a proverbial “good person” who respected women and their feelings and intents in society. He has nothing against women who would want to work while they’re mothers he might say, he just does not want to marry them. 

This issue is complicated by the fact that it is not a clean social problem the way sexuality perhaps is. A woman’s stance in the home as defined by her willingness to work outside the home conflates economics with sociology and thus one could claim there is more at stake when a woman wants to assert economic dependence, something beyond mere social identity.

Draft of Lessons on “Statistical Physics of the Symmetric Group”
Learning to achieve a goal feels more fulfilling than “simply” learning to learn:

Familiarity supplements learning: Most really new material seems intimidating when you first encounter it. Multivariable calculus, Quantum Mechanics, Supersymmetry. And often the very prospect of having to deal with something so daunting, makes learning more difficult. Yet, after a day or two of reading through the new material, and simply seeing it again and again (not even assimilating it in any way), makes the material seem less threatening, and thus makes it easier to learn. Simply spending a long amount of with material makes it easier to assimilate.

This was the case with many of the mathematical topics cited above. My first tack at working through their relevant texts was limited by my insecurity in my ability to navigate this new domain, an insecurity which gradually melted away the more time I spent with the material. 

Finding some ever deeper and widening familiarity with progressively difficult topics is probably the standard way to learn more and more difficult things. 

Establishing familiarity often simply amounts to reading or studying something one day, and then reading/studying it again the next day. It is strangely simple but this period of a day or two is often enough, to allow some progress in the work

Takeaway: When starting to learn difficult material, take a day or two to just read through the material. Don’t feel discouraged or overwhelmed by the extent that you don’t know, rather use this period to develop a “recognition” level (i.e., lowest level bloom’s taxonomy) understanding of the work.



Allow projects to guide what you learn: I am taking this new approach to learning, which so far seems marginally successful. There are lot of subject I want to learn in physics and mathematics, so much so, that whenever I open a textbook or a treatise on a mathematical subject I can feel overwhelmed by how much material I’m interested in. What helps with this is having some external objective which allows you to more selectively filter the material according to what could bring you closer to that objective. That way, you can learn something about a new subject (when, of course, it would be impossible to learn everything), and escape the feeling that you’re drowning in information. 

By working on this project I learned so much mathematics just by allowing the project goals to guide what I studied. Derangements; Digamma function; Symmetric Polynomials; Ill-Defined Partial Differential Equations; Lambert W Function; Symmetric Group. All of these subjects involved topics I was at least superficially interested in, but which I probably would have felt overwhelmed to learn about without the context of the project. 

Moreover, having the project as the motivation and context for this new material, gave me an immediate opportunity to apply what I learned in a new situation, which is, of course, the ultimate arbiter of whether you learned something. 

Takeaway: Allow projects to guide the mathematics and physics that you learn, that way you can establish an external context for your work and select which specific material in a large subject is relevant to you. The question you’re always asking is not “How do I solve their problem” but “How does this help solve my problem?”

——

You probably don’t know what the question is: When you start a project, you begin with a motivating question which directs the smaller questions you ask and situates the entire work. This question is important because it provides the fuel for your work, but it is almost formulated in ignorance, when you know the least you ever do about the work. Largely the work of project consists not only of solving a problem, but determining what problem you want to solve, finding that small space of questions in the overlap between the questions you want to ask and the questions you can ask. 

Consequently, the question that you start an investigation with is often not the question you’ll end up answering. In short, you probably do not know what the question is. And as such you shouldn’t fall in love with your initial question. If an idea is sufficiently powerful, it should be possible to explore and elucidate it even if you don’t pursue the question which motivated the idea. 

Takeaway: The key to being able to find and engage with good ideas is to have lots of ideas. You have to be committed enough to an idea to be able to explore it, but not so blindly committed that you can’t see other useful ideas

——

Immersion leads to insight: The question of where insight comes from is an important one. How can you see “into” a work in a way which allows you to move past roadblocks or understand which questions are the best questions to ask? I’m still not sure how insight arises, but I do now have an idea of when it arises. About a year ago, when I took two weeks to write up my results on the “thermal permutations” project, I went without TV series and podcasts. The result was a lot of cognitive space was freed for me to think of the project itself. A number of insights were generated during period (the main one of which was the parameter space phase diagram), and I honestly can’t say whether I would have thought of them had I been more distracted. 

Another way to cultivate immersion, is through the attempts to develop the background material for a project. As you’re learning about master equations, phase transitions, or basic group theory, if you can manage to learn to think in this new mathematical language you can possibly learn to frame novel questions that you wouldn’t have otherwise considered. Thus, the process of learning could also be seen as immersion. 

Takeaway: Being immersed in the subject by working through the background mathematical material, trying to explore the space of the problem (or collection of problems), or simply focusing only on the work for an extended period of time often leads to novel insights about the work. I’m not sure why this happens, but it seems to happen very often. 


——
It really is OK/preferable to start small: This work began from a problem solved in April 2015 in a stochastic optimization class. The analytic calculation associated with that problem took me many pages and a day or so to complete, but it can now be written down in half a page in a matter of minutes. 

In other words, the problem that I started with was arguably quite trivial, but it led to all the other (rather non-trivial) work that followed. When that first problem was completed, I had in a sense established a foundation which served as a launching point for all the other questions I asked. And so that first problem, was much more important than the difficult and profundity of its solution implied. 

Starting from a really small and simple starting point also allows you to begin far a field from current/existing work and develop from the ground up, a really original idea

I imagine that if I had maintained the perspective which possessed me years ago that a problem has to be immediately interesting and profound upon formulation then I would have abandoned this work a long time ago as to unimportant to work on. 

Takeaway: As long as you start with a clear idea and implement that idea through a well-defined problem, it doesn’t matter how small that problem is. You can expand upon it in new and interesting directions, directions which can be newly seen as profitable due to the concrete context you first developed.

Everything takes more than twice as long as you thought it would: One summer while working for Jesse Thaler, I proposed a number of additional projects I wanted to work on. Jesse listened carefully to my proposal, then tried to renormalize my expectations. He said it first took six months to learn enough about a field in order to do something interesting in it, and then another six months to find and answer an interesting question. I remember being skeptical of his claim especially given the fact it seemed to contradict his research work to that point. But the more work I do in physics and mathematics the more it seems that his claim was an underestimate. 

I mean I really started working on this project in November of 2015, and it’s now a few days before the new year, and there are still important questions that I want to but have not yet answered. This fact is worth remembering for future projects. 

Takeaway: Start early and work often, but regardless of what you think about the time scale associated with a project, you’re probably underestimating it. This isn’t even advice. This is to help you normalize your expectations. Get used to it.

—

Getting a first draft to other people is helpful: A large forward step in this work came when I started discussing it with other people. Specifically, it was when I drafted the document and sent it to various professors (only two of which, Jacob and Erel, read it), that I, one, started thinking seriously about how to organize the ideas in the work and, two, started incorporating other people’s ideas in order to make the work better. 

This approach of drafting the current status of my work with the intent to send it out to others is fortunately a good habit of mine. I’ll need to do it again when I start working on new projects. 

Takeaway: After you obtain some results and can think of a suitable narrative for them, compose a written outline of your work that you can show to other people. The act of writing should polish your thinking and alert you to new questions you haven’t before considered, and showing it to other people allows external perspectives to improve the work and the questions you consider. 

——

Push work towards calculating an observable:In order to really appreciate the potency of a new idea you need to get a sense of how that idea changes problems or situations you already understand well. The power in Einstein’s postulates of relativity and in the Einstein’s equations surely exists partly in these principles themselves but also extends largely from the implications these principles have on our world. One could imagine that if Einstein, presented the principles without their next order implications, it would have been even more challenging to take his ideas seriously. 

More ordinarily, although the idea of the work—studying statistical mechanics in the case where the state space consists of permutations or a list—is interesting in of itself, it becomes much more compelling when you see how this idea leads to unexpected results in phase diagrams (that strange order-partial order metastable region) and transition temperatures (the two transition temperatures) and models of equilibrium behavior (the continuum partial differential equation). In another example, the idea of rubberband bound atoms is interesting but feels much more compelling if you show how the resulting equation of state differs from the idea gas law. 

Arguably, as a physicist, I’m not even going far enough since my results, although physical, are not numerical. Namely I’m not predicting anything concrete, just presenting general results. Still, the lessons are the same. To validate the utility of a new idea, you need to show how this idea changes something we ordinarily understand. 

Takeaway: Don’t be satisfied with presenting new principles couched in a mathematical language. To really validate the utility of a new idea, you need to both explore it and push it deeper and deeper towards the calculation of something concrete or sufficiently well known in the theoretical literature that people feel they can understand the new idea through this old context.

——-

New Idea and Mathematical Framework: For a long time, I have tried to determine the basic factors/properties that make a work of mathematics/physics publishable, or, at the very least, steadies it as a new contribution to the world of mathematical and non-mathematical physics? Reviewing my own work, and much of the work I’ve appreciated in the past (Feynman’s papers, England’s work on Self-Replication, Weinberg Witten Theorem, etc.) it seems that what establishes an investigation as valuable and distinct from other work is that it 

contains a new idea
represents that idea in a mathematical context which others can explore/use

One counter example to this framing is Feynman’s paper on Superfluidity (and Superconductivity, I think), but I believe this is largely general. The framework often comes from the field in which the idea is developed, or the mathematical subject which best serves as the appropriate logical mirror to the idea. 

(I think this is what has riddled your attempt to do something interesting in quantum field theory. The existing mathematical formalisms of QFT (that you know of) do not well match the ideas you want to pursue. So you need to either (both?) find new ideas or (and?) new mathematical formulations for qft.)

Takeaway: There are two things you need for an investigation: a new idea and an explicit mathematical framework (either one that already exists or one that you develop) which makes the idea concrete. Arguably (from the last point) you also need to derive the physical/mathematical implications of this new 
idea. 

Seek out what you cannot do/do not understand: Toward the ends of becoming better at engaging with questions—answering them, recognizing they exist, questioning the motivations and values which lead to them—it crucial to stretch yourself beyond what is comfortable and familiar and toward things which you cannot yet accomplish or even begin to understand. 

I am talking about finding a way to engage with the unknown unknowns: crucially important information and proficiencies which you simultaneously lack and are unaware that you lack because you have not yet even intuited the problems which necessitate their existence. Before you can engage with these unknown unknowns, you need to engage with the boundary of your presumed knowledge and deal the things you know that you do not yet know. It is within this space of known unknowns that you eventually encounter previously unknown unknowns and move forward the boundary and depth of your understanding. 

This is a lesson which follows directly from work associated with this project. Surely, much of the work within the project now consists of ideas and results which were ‘unknown unknowns’ a year ago, and the way I brought this work into light (moving it to known-unknowns and finally known-knowns) was by pursuing fervently the things I did not completely yet understand. 

Takeaway: To mover towards a deeper level of understanding/proficiency of/within the world, seek the limits of your knowledge and abilities and play and work at these boundaries. (This is consonant with Erickkson’s ideas on deliberate practice). Doing so not only deepens your understanding of things you already know (or think you know), but also, self-effacingly, expands the range of things you recognize you’re ignorant of. 


Learn from Pedagogical Monographs: A good way to get a sense of interesting results and problems in a field or in science in general is to work through pedagogical monographs for the subject. Research monographs, are not the best because they are more of a discussion of results/ideas without the formalistic context for you to rigorously develop similar ideas on your own. Also the better pedagogical texts are the ones which are not forbiddingly cumulative and in which you could go to a randomly chosen page and learn something interesting independent of what was developed in previous pages. 

I didn’t really apply this lesson to the statistical physics of the symmetric group work, but I’m doing it currently in learning about phase transitions in non-physics subjects (Ricard Solé’s book) and it feels great to be learning such things. 

Takeaway: Use monographs/treatises to develop your knowledge of new fields. Especially useful if you can use the monographs to internalize the questions (and the value system underlying them) of a subject a long with the techniques used to answer them. 















Imaginative courage is important, but so too is earnest and active implementation: It is not enough to dream of work you can do, you also need to actually do it. I was so lucky that Amir didn’t take me on as a student. 
Not one perfect leap, but a million perfect steps: Will Smith has this quote… I think this is the only way I will ever be able to complete the work I want to. Imagining it in toto is paralyzing. Thinking of one little thing then doing it and then the next is easier. 
Transition from Exploration to Directed Search: The way you engage with the work when you’re looking a reason to pursue it is different form how you should engage with it after you’ve found a reason to work on it. (This was partly Vinny’s claim, in your oral exam. You felt like you were still exploring the work and Vinny felt like you should be asking specific questions.)
Push Work to Compute an Observable/(Standard theoretical quantity): A lot of the ways I found to extend the model arose from trying to find a way to extend it far beyond its established context of validity. I think it is useful to do this within the domain in which the work is formulated/done, but I also think it is useful to apply this philosophy even far beyond the work itself. 



Notes from oral exam

Fixed Amino Acid Composition: Need a better justification for assuming fixed amino acid composition. This is related to the energy gap between the native conformation and all other conformations. 
Transition temperature: Does the transition temperature need to be derived more rigorously?
Motivation for PDE: Is there a better reason to develop a continuum model for the model of permutations, other than the fact it is interesting?
Distribution of Energy costs: For finding a soluble model of the first example of the permutation model, it might be better to assume a distribution of lambda_i values rather than fixing lambda_i = lambda_0. The annealed problem is more soluble than the quenched problem, but has less of a physical motivation.
Mathematics versus the Physics: Most of the above concerns the mathematics/physics of the work, but what should the focus of the work be? Should it further explore the mathematical/physical implications of the abstracted model or should it’s problems be directed toward answering specific questions in protein design.
Solubility of Interacting Model: Instead of the all-interacting model, is it possible to solve an interacting model with index-dependent interactions. A matrix would be more general, (something like
) But it is apparently possible to consider a model where the matrix can be represented as two interacting spins as 
) and we sum over various realizations of sigma_i
What is the relationship between protein design and the spin glass problem?
There needs to be a clearer motivation for the partial differential equation work
Correct expression for landau free energy for linear model
Is there a way to exactly solve the matrix interacting model?
Where does the interaction energy value come from?

What do you want the focus of the work to be? The Physics/Mathematics or the Problem of Protein Design?

I misinterpreted an analytical result For the case of quadratic interactions the lambda_2-independent transition temperature (lambda_1/ln N) was also derived from the j=0 condition.

The Child and the Shadow

The man is all that is civilized—learned, kindly, idealistic, decent. The shadow is all that gets suppressed in the process of becoming a decent civilized adult. the shadow is the man’s thwarted selfishness, his unadmitted  desires, the swearwords he never spoke, the murders he didn’t commit. The shadow is the dark side of his soul, the unadmitted, the inadmissible. 
	And what Anderson is saying is that this monster is an integral part of the man and cannot be denied—…
— Ursula K. Le Guin “The Child and the Shadow”


The great fantasies, myths, and tales are indeed like dreams; they speak from the unconscious to the unconscious, in the language of the unconscious—symbol and archetype. 
— Same

…Andersen’s story says that a man who will not confront and accept his shadow is a lost soul. 
— Same

The ego, the little private individual consciousness, knows this, and it knows that if it’s not to be trapped in the hopeless silence of autism it must identify with something outside itself, beyond itself, larger than itself. If it’s weak, or if it’s offered nothing better, what it does is identify with the `collective consciousness.’ That is Jung’s term for a kind of lowest common denominator of all the little egos added together, the mass mind which consists of such things as cults, creeds, fads, fashions, status-seeking, conventions, received beliefs, advertising, popcult, all the isms, all the ideologies, all the hollow forms of communication and ‘togetherness’ that lack real communication or real sharing. The ego accepting these empty forms, becomes a member of the ‘lonely crowd.’ To avoid this, to attain real community, it must turn inward, away from the crowd to the source: it must identify with its own deeper regions, the great unexplored regions of the Self…and it is in [it] where we all meet, that he sees the source of true community; of felt religion; of art, grace, spontaneity, and love. 
— Same

The shadow stands on the threshold between the conscious and the unconscious mind…It is all we don’t want to, can’t, admit into our conscious self, all the qualities and tendencies within us which have been repressed, denied, or not used. 
— Same

Jung himself said, ‘Everybody carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual’s conscious life, the blacker and denser it is.’
— 

If the individual wants to live in the real world, he must withdraw his projections; he must admit that the hateful, the evil, exists within himself.
— Le Guin

The person who denies his own profound relationship with evil denies his own reality. 
— Same

That is escapism, that posing evil as a ‘problem,’ instead of what it is: all the pain and suffering and waste and loss and injustice we will meet all our lives long, and must face and cope with over and over and over, and admit, and live with, in order to live human lives at all. 
— Same

The young creature does need protection and shelter. But it also needs truth. And it seems to me that the way you can speak absolutely honestly and factually to a child about both good and evil is to talk about himself. 
— Same.

My qualifying exam
Monday of this week I passed my qualifying exam at Harvard. I came into it with a confidence which was not appropriate given my level of knowledge, and I stumbled often during the exam many times finding myself unable to answer questions which upon retrospect had easy answers. “You say your work is a mean field model. What fluctuations is the model neglecting?” “Where does the value of U_0 come from?” “The assumption of fixed amino acid composition optimizes something. What does it optimize?” These questions, extending quite fairly from the research topic itself, were not even pulled from the vagaries of statistical mechanics lore, and still I could not answer them. 

So after what I had thought was a disastrous performance, I stepped outside of J356 for Vinny, Michael, and Eugene to deliberate. When I re-entered I had learned that I had passed, and apparently had done well. Nevertheless, I was chastened.  In truth, the days before the talk, I was quite certain I would pass. I had prepared what I had believed was an excellent presentation, and the research results were solid as far as I could tell. But my display during the exam thrust me back into the doubt I had encountered during this same time in 2015 and again in 2014 and certainly in 2013. The question: what was I doing here, pretending to be a physicist, pretending to have confidence in the direction of my life, a confidence that nothing in my daily living could really support?

Here is something it has taken me some time to admit. If Ariel had accepted me as his student, I likely would have continued working on the project he had assigned (propelled by some arbitrary principle that “I should finish what I started”), and would have never focused on the thermal permutations work, would have never completed a first draft of that work, would have never sent it to Jacob, would have never taken the random walk through professors which led me to Eugene. Ariel freed and helped me in a way that my standard interpretation of what it constitutes to “help” someone does not allow. In a sense, not at all sarcastic or hyperbolic, his decisions and my interactions with his decisions were as essential to my eventual work as were those of Jacob and Eugene. 

The questions I ask are propelled/motivated not only by what I find interesting about the world, but also by my sense of confusion, by my own interpretation of and response to what I believe I do not understand. But what determines what I am confused by? What separates what I believe I do not understand from what I believe I do understand, and how do I learn to make that separation?

Thus there is a sort of cliched narrative associated with how someone can arrive at the place I currently am. I started by following the traditional path, attempting to attach myself to a research project an advisor provided. But despite my efforts, my work was not enough and I was “let go” ever before the work could be pushed to completion. Frustrated and dejected I started working on my own project, and after some time I had found work I enjoyed even more than the work from which I was “fired”, work which was, to me at least, more important than the other work. 

But this story, as do most stories of the past, fails to adequately convey the essential element which would allow someone in the present to make use of the story’s lessons. It overlooks this essential factor in much the same way that a finished painting cannot help but elide the artist’s efforts, his torments during the process of work. For what is missing in my recounting and in your emotional response is uncertainty. You know how the story will end, so gone from you is the doubt and fear which was like an invisible viscous medium for me, always felt but never so obviously present that I could point to it as the cause for my sluggishness. And without a sense of uncertainty you are incapable of truly envisioning your place in my place, incapable of imagining what it will take for you to make again in the moment the decisions that I have with great difficulty already made.

A confession: It was really my inability to deal with the inherent uncertainty of my future which made me unable to envision anything positive arising from my time at Harvard. And deeper still, it was my inability to contend with the uncertainty of scientific work that made it impossible for me to do the work I enjoyed, made it impossible for me to understand what it meant to work on a project, made me grudgingly OK with someone else assigning to me a project which they believed was soluble.

It was only when I learned how to navigate this uncertainty, this constant ever present feeling of doubt, not until I learned how, in Bolaño’s parlance, “to search even when I did not know what I was searching for” that I could walk through this medium of doubt without being crippled by it. And now, I like to believe I am better at this navigation than I was before, and the work I have done toward my oral exam partly affirms this. Surely, I am not yet where I want to be, but the question of whether I need to attach myself to a professor in order to get through graduate school has been answered in the negative. It is possible. I can choose my own direction, and I will not inevitably fail when I do so.

[//]




People modulate the anxiety created by such an uncertain future by imagining some narrative which places them in a concrete context of action and reaction.

Academia as a Pyramid Scheme
How is academia (at least in the sciences) a pyramid scheme of identity development? Most (or just many?) academics believe that their academic work is inevitably intertwined with their personal identity. By personal identity I mean all of the qualities, thoughts, and actions which allow a person to see herself as apart from a group, the individual consciousness which is unique to each person and distinct from Jung’s collective consciousness. Thus the work that a researcher or professor does is in a sense conflated with the project of their identity, for it is through such work that they begin to understand their relationship with the world and whether they have a place in that world. Finding such a place requires an introspective look at one’s own values and a sufficient understanding of the world to see how such personal values could be made manifest to others. But rarely does the academic have an opportunity to implement or even begin such an introspection. From the moment she joins an institution, an academic’s identity development is halted, always with the claim of the temporary nature of this halt, as the academic works to achieve something apparently necessary to keep her on the path toward identity development. As an undergraduate, she must dedicate herself to classes and research projects often only tangentially related to her early scientific interests because she must focus on entering graduate school. As a graduate student she has to be attach herself to an advisor and be assigned a project upon which she works faithfully, so she can obtain a good recommendation for a post-doc. As a post-doc she must display a preternatural understanding of the questions her field wants to answer (which as a rule are distinguished from the questions she wants to answer) in order to impress the luminaries of that field.. As a professor, she must produce and produce at rates which do not allow for much beyond variations on the themes of existing research in order to allow her to achieve the tenure which will finally grant her the freedom to do the work she wants. 

During each stage she is trading on her time in the present for some time in the future when she could “finally” do the work she wants. And part of the reason she so willing goes along with such bargaining is that most of her professors, most of her peers, and most of her students are doing so as well. The assumption which keeps the pyramid in place and growing is the belief that those further along in the process (the early adopters) are closer to achieving the ostensible goal, than those who enter later. But in fact these early adopters have only invested more time and by some perspective could be seen as farther from achieving the goal than their later counterparts. 

Individuals in the pyramid scheme always believe they can use the structure of the scheme to achieve their individual goals, never realizing that by buying into the structure and operating within it, they are instead being used by the structure to achieve the goals of whoever devised it.

(Sentences for Story: Don’t hate the player/Jamal and Christina)
Leonardo Da Vinci has this quote: “It had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them. They went out and happened to things.” Inspirational stuff, for sure, but it has never really been true to my life. I was never one to jump through hoops, and instead always preferred when the hoops came to me and wriggled their way around and past my body.

Jamal was in the process of coming to terms with his vulnerabilities. The unintended consequence of love was vulnerability

What was happening was that Jamal was gradually learning about helplessness and impotence, learning that the unintended consequence of love was vulnerability, learning that when you attach your happiness to the whims and concessions of kindness of another you are ever after at the mercy of their character. 

(When Jamal appears to have had a revelation)
I looked at Jamal. For a moment it seemed like he was at last coming to terms with his own fundamental impotence, learning that the inevitable consequence of love was vulnerability, discovering that when you attach your happiness to the whims and concessions of kindness of another, you are ever after at the mercy of their character (and their own vulnerabilities).

We know that in some circumstances pain is inevitable, and so often the best we can do is mitigate the pain, lessen its effect. But I’ve found women, all their natural emotional intelligence to the contrary, are somewhat artless in how they save men from their pain.

“In the 1960s, traditional statistics was a mature field with an enormous toolbox. Mandelbrot was coming forward with little more than a suggestion and a few pictures…It would be like telling a carpenter that screws are much stronger than nails, when the carpenter has a hammer and no one has yet invented a screwdriver. Even if the house would be stronger if built with screws, you’d still get much farther working with a hammer and nails, at least for a while.”

Recapitulating the Lesson
Months ago in my “Lessons of Thermal Permutations” draft, I noted the difficulty of working on both writing and technical projects at the same time. I noted that during the two weeks when I composed the essence of the Thermal permutations work, I needed to first complete that composition before I could start writing “The Missing Curriculum” work. This was a tack to work I rarely followed, instead often believing I can work on my writing in the morning and then work on physics in the afternoon and evening. I’ve tried that for the past few days in New Orleans, and although I’ve been getting somewhere with the physics, I’ve stalled more or less completely with my writing. This has been hopelessly frustrating until I recalled the lesson from months ago. I really have no idea how I managed to take two writing classes and write my thesis during my final semester at MIT, but I’m not going to assume such a tack is generally possible. 

Lesson: You don’t need to work on your writing and your physics work simultaneously. Use a few weeks, to complete a block of your physics work, and then a few weeks to complete a block of your writing work. (I’m not sure how absolutely efficient this is, but it is certainly less vexing than your current approach of alternating your work tasks within the day)

Kissing Amy Gilson
The night before I returned to New Orleans, I had dinner with Amy Gilson. We went to Tanjore, where I asked her questions about her Veganism and we talked about Black Mirror. It was a standard pattern for us by this point, one in which I had not intuited any deeper significance until that significance had drifted so close as to be unmistakable. We would enter into discussions on religion versus science, Harvard’s graduate students unionization efforts and tactics, the institutional structure of science, or politics in America and although I rarely had such wide ranging conversations with anyone, I had somehow believed that my talks with Amy were completely natural, not at all out of step with the current of my life. What obscured the signal were surely the Social Justice Fridays, where Abby, Delilah, John, Jacob, Nick, Eric and I have been discussing such things for months. But really Amy was not part of this contingent, and it was an oversight to take her perspectives for granted. 

Two nights before this dinner, Amy came to my holiday party. I had forgotten she was vegan until hours before the party, and in a moment of panic I cooked a mix of fried rice, green peppers, and onions, so she would have something to eat amidst the fried rice with egg, chicken, and pulled pork entrees. She stayed well into the night, helping my roommates and I clean after most of the guests had led. With her leftover rice in a container, I walked her down the stairs to the small alcove which comprised the entirety of our first floor landing. 

“Thank you for inviting me,” she said. 

I thanked her for coming, and in a move that I suppose she wasn’t expecting I extended my arms to hug her. She paused for a moment, and then wrapped her arms around my torso, and placed her cheek on my chest, squeezing me like she was experiencing some renewal from the embrace. 

Years ago, Hillary a student at Wellesley and a common attendee at Nu Delta’s social events told me that I was the kind of guy who would have no idea that a girl liked me. I scoffed at this, for I thought that I had an unusually high degree of emotional intelligence compared to most other men. Of course, this might still be true—and for egotistical reasons I will likely continue to believe it is—but what is certainly true is that I did not know that Amy had any non-platonic interest in me until the moment after that party. That weekend I fantasized about her, imagined the both of us under covers with daylight spilling through my navy blue drapes. Where was this coming from, I asked myself. Why would I allow the fantasies now? Merely because I had received a faint indication that they may not just be fantasies?

I wasn’t always so cowardly when it came to relationships like these. It’s just that my recent experiences with Jiwon and Tony had taught me an important lesson about love and vulnerability, and I did not want to repeat those lessons. Amy was a friend, and so long as I continued to see her that way, and so long as we kept a seemingly proper distance, I would never develop the resentment which would destroy the friendship we already had. In fact, I had told myself, expecting anything more was succumbing to cupidity. Our conversations were enough, I believed, and I should appreciate them for what they already provided instead of what I thought I needed. 

This generous interpretation of relationships, too, was new. It had dawned on me weeks ago that my previous recognition that I too was callous and passively hostile was not enough. I had accepted my immorality as part of the general immorality of all people, but I had not interrogated it as deeply in my case as I did in the cases of others because I felt for me, unlike for anyone else, it was justified. I had believed that since I had not yet received what I wanted in life and relationships—specifically that even by 25 I had not achieved that banal and basic requirement of modern masculinity—I had implicitly been given the license to be a terrible person, as if morality and justice arose only from fulfilled agreements the universe made with the indigent, as if kindness was a gift a person would willingly give to others so long as he felt he received it first. 

The “come-to-Jesus” moment was precipitated by a girl. On the last class day of AP50, I went with Philip, Kaushik, and Miles to the food trucks on the science center plaza. There I saw Amiya, a student who also took the “Teaching as Storytelling” class. I spoke to her for a few minutes before asking for her number with the agreement that we should get coffee before the end of the semester. The following week I texted her twice to no response. To make absolutely sure, she was ignoring me I sent her an email which also netted no response. By this point I had sufficiently removed myself from the situation to recognize that I was once again slogging through a tired script of 21st century dating. The script has arguably been enacted ever since homo sapiens courtship rituals have been in existence, but the disembodied nature of our current technological mediums seem to now lend it a particularly unceremonious note. 

As was typical, I felt anger and disillusionment, and I desired retribution. I imagined her contacting me weeks or months down the line and me ignoring her with the same apparent ease that she did me. But then I saw Amiya and I, and everyone else in our generation, and in so many generations passed and generations yet to come locked in a larger script of the human condition, one which made hatred easy when one felt one was hated first. Amiya’s callousness was like a virus which would only propagate to me if I lacked the emotional immune system to fight it. She had set me aside, and what was lost in this act was my trust in her and consequently the potential for a future relationship; I, too, did not have to lose my morality, my sense of what was right in the world.

And so with Amy, I imagined that our relationship could be what it was (or what I thought it was) without me growing in bitterness and despair. She was special and I felt lucky to have met her and that was enough. But after that moment in the last week of this semester, at the end of the holiday party, at the bottom of the stairs I saw that my acceptance was perhaps grounded less in a mature reading of reality than in an tolerance of a relational status quo. Maybe she did like me, and maybe our relationship did not have to live within the cage I had accepted as good enough. 

On the Monday night of our dinner, Amy and I walked back to my home on Parkdale street, and with my roommates we altogether watched the “White Christmas” episode of Black Mirror. Amy was prescient throughout the entire episode anticipating and predicting plot points that I took much longer to see when I had seen the episode a week earlier. At one point she put her hand on my leg, and, in mild shock, I tensed, and then immediately afterwards stretched to cover up the extent of my shock. At one point, she asked me when I was going to the airport, and when I told her I was going at 6am, she offered to wake me up. It was a supposedly innocuous claim, but at that moment it seemed to have an underlying sensual note that I think even my roommates intuited. 

When she left, I walked her to the door. “Where are you going,” she asked me. “I’ll walk with you back to your place,” I said, “at least for a little bit.” When we left the house and started walking on the street, she looped her hand into my elbow. And I suppose it was only this explicit act which placed everything else that happened in the night so plainly in focus. The feints and mirages were all real. She did like me. 

If you truly believe you understand one particular thing, and you discover that your understanding of this thing is totally incorrect, then not only is that specific understanding flawed, but so too are the criteria by which you decide that you understand anything at all. If I did not know that Amy was attracted to me(?), interested in me(?), liked me(?) (I really don’t know the best phrase to use here), then not only was I ignorant in this case, I may have just as well been ignorant of other people’s attraction in the past. This idea interests me in a way which is nakedly egocentric, but also in the way it seems to touch upon the fundamental tragedy that one can only really understand a reality once one no longer occupies it.

We held hands as we walked to her place, and when we got there I made good on a promise I made to myself moments after we left my house, and I kissed her. In my first attempt, I maladroitly missed her lips and kissed the side of her face instead and had to try a few times before a rhythm was established. After some moments, I pulled away, and laughed. “I’m sorry,” I said, “that was pretty awkward.” She laughed back, and said “Well it takes two people to be awkward.” 

I walked back home, surreality competing with reality, my mind trying to understand this new place I had found myself. There was a buoyancy in this feeling, something which made me wonder what Icarus would have felt moments before he approached the sun. A few hours later, she picked me up from home and drove me to the airport. In the departure drive way, I kissed her—this time not missing—and said good bye. 

I have been a few days in New Orleans, and she is in Cambridge, and now I primarily have fantasies and memories to bolster my connection to her. And strangely, in the vacuum of any in-person meeting, my attachment to her is growing and growing, completely out of step with the pace at which it grew before. I feel lost and found at the same time, and I am struggling to accept that someone I like likes me in turn, and struggling still to build some new identity out of the rubble of one previously built on my fundamental dissonance with other people.

Men do not mistakes due to experience. They make mistakes due to judgment, the most principal mistake of which being expecting from experience what experience cannot provide. 

Mistakes are not made due to experiences. Mistakes instead extend from judgments, the most problematic of these being the belief that experience can give what experience can never really provide: details of the future.

The thought experiment doesn’t hold up…Obama’s solution relies on a goodwill that his own personal history tells him exists in the larger country. My own history tells me something different. The large numbers of black men in jail, for instance, are not just the result of poor policy, but of not seeing those men as human.
— Ta Nehisi Coates “My President Was Black”

Six months later the awful price of a black presidency would be known to those students, even as the country seemed determined not to acknowledge it. In the days after Donald Trump’s victory, there would be an insistence that something as “simple” as racism could not explain it. As if enslavement had nothing to do with global economics, or as if lynchings said nothing about the idea of women as property. As though the past 400 years could be reduced to the irrational resentment of full lips. No. Racism is never simple. And there was nothing simple about what was coming, or about Obama, the man who had unwittingly summoned this future into being.
— Ta Nehisi Coates My President Was Black

It was said that the Americans who’d supported Trump were victims of liberal condescension. The word racist would be dismissed as a profane slur put upon the common man, as opposed to an accurate description of actual men. “We simply don’t yet know how much racism or misogyny motivated Trump voters,” David Brooks would write in The New York Times. “If you were stuck in a jobless town, watching your friends OD on opiates, scrambling every month to pay the electric bill, and then along came a guy who seemed able to fix your problems and hear your voice, maybe you would stomach some ugliness, too.” This strikes me as perfectly logical. Indeed, it could apply just as well to Louis Farrakhan’s appeal to the black poor and working class. But whereas the followers of an Islamophobic white nationalist enjoy the sympathy that must always greet the salt of the earth, the followers of an anti-Semitic black nationalist endure the scorn that must ever greet the children of the enslaved.

The Man and the Shadow

Our conceptualization and definition of the word “shadow” replaces the absence of a thing for the thing itself. For because we all typically live in a world of light (from the sun, from fluorescent lights, from laptops) only intermittently interrupted by moments of darkness, this light by which everything is seen becomes the standard by which everything is judged. And thus we think of shadow as resulting from an absence of light when in fact, the “shadow” is the preeminent state of the universe and light an interloper. 

What people see in the night sky depicts this fact in microcosm: Leagues of darkness in which one can locate randomly interspersed beacons of light. But perhaps it also comments on what we see in ourselves, for given the apparent rarity of human life—or sentient life—or life in general—maybe it betrays no coincidence that when such creatures peer up at the black horizon they see their foil in the blackness itself and see their mirror in the tiny dots of light which appear to be struggling against it. 


“Sornette didn’t come up with the notion of self-organization, though he has done as much work on the theory as anyone. Instead, he realized something slightly different. He finally understood how a small labor strike differs from a catastrophic one. All strikes are caused by the same sorts of sparks: an egregious injury; an unfair termination; cut wages. You might think that there’s no way of telling which such events will lead to a nationwide walkout. A large strike looks like a small strike that, for whatever reason, simply didn’t stop. So, too, with the microfractures that, under some circumstances, seem to explode into ruptures that tear a material apart. But the biggest strikes require something more than just a spark: they require a labor movement, with a high degree of structure and a capacity for coordinated action. They require a mechanism for system-wide feedback and amplification. In other words, if you want to predict a major strike, don’t look for the grievances. Those are always there. Look for the unions. Look for the telltale patterns of self-organization. Coordination, rather than the pinpricks, is what really leads to critical events.

Notes from Physics of Wallstreet

I just finished reading Physics of Wallstreet. I like the book, although it didn’t go as far as I was expecting in that it didn’t really explain the Physics which underlay the specific models that led to the 2008 crash. Still it provided a detailed historical account of how the study of markets was made quantitative and rigorous through a migration of physicist and mathematicians to finance and economics. There are a few major points I’m taking away from the account.

Bachelier and Prices as Random Walks: Louis Bachelier was historically the first to develop the concept and mathematical techniques associated with random walks. He applied them to study a French stock exchange and surmised that the prices of stocks undergo Random Walks. 

He also had an interesting biography. His parents died when he was a young adult which forced him into the position of head of his family. By this point he had been accepted into a prestigious French technical school, but without the funds to attend he had to delay his mathematical studies until later. He had a run in with the other French mathematician Levy who stalled his career because he incorrectly cited a mistake in his work. Well into his middle age he finally received a tenured position, although his ideas on Random Walks and the stock market were never well received during his lifetime. 

Osborne and Rates of Return as Random Walks: M.F.M Osborne corrected Bachelier’s ideas by arguing that if prices were indeed random walks, then at some point they would have to be negative which of course never occurs. Instead he surmised that rates of return, rather than prices, followed a random walk. Weatherall states that the rates of return are related to the logarithm of prices which suggests a formula (which I don’t completely understand) of d log(price)/dt = rate of return. In any case, the result is that prices are not normally distribution, but log-normally distributed. 
Osborne (on whom the internet does not seem to yield any useful information), too, has an interesting biography. He was one of these very non-traditional scientists who worked on multiple fields throughout his lifetime. I think he began as a physicist and started working on economics as a side project. He worked at the Navy at some point as well. An interesting (likely paraphrased) quote from him “All daily work for the government can be done in two hours, and two hours is too long to spend working for the government”

Mandelbrot and Long Tailed Distributions: Both Osborne’s and Bachelier’s ideas concerning stock prices rely on the assumption of normal distributions. However the problem with the normal distribution, Mandelbrot argued, is that it assumes events far from the mean (like a sudden drop in stock price) almost never occur. Mandelbrot claimed long-tailed distributions (termed Levy stable distributions) would better model how prices changed in the stock market. Apparently even Levy stable distributions do not accurately model the long-tailed events in the stock market. 

Mandelbrot is most well known for his work on fractals. His father was a mathematician, a rather traditional one, and expected Mandelbrot to follow in his footsteps. But Mandelbrot was interested in strange, only vaguely mathematical things, like Zipf’s law so he didn’t seem like a promising researcher. Also, apparently Mandelbrot didn’t have a doctoral advisor, a fact that he is quite proud of. 

Didier Sornette and the Dragon King: Didier Sornette was another . The “dragon king” is a name conjured in comparison to Nassim Taleb’s “black swan”. While the “black swan” typified an event which almost never occurred, it still existed in the class of events normally expected to occur (“swans”). The “dragon king” however was something so out of the ordinary that it seemed impossible. 

Ironically, Sornette’s argument was that although “black swan” events could not be predicted, the even less likely but much more radical “dragon king” events could. The telltale sign was observing so called “log-periodic” changes in disturbances. Namely when disturbances occurred more and more frequently, then a “dragon king” like event was about to occur. 

Sornette began as a geophysicist and it was his work on predicting earthquakes which eventually led him into attempting to predict other catastrophic events like Market crashes. By Weatherall’s account, Sornette predicted most of the economic crashes of the late 20th and early 21st centuries (the 1998 Asian Flu crash, the dot-com bubble, the 2008 crash), and all extended from his notice of the “log-periodic” behavior of catastrophic events.

Weinstein and Malaney, Economics as Gauge Theory: Malaney was an economics Ph.D student and Weinstein was a mathematical physics post-doc when they joined forces to work on a problem in economics (while dating). Their goal was to find a better way to calculate and generally understand the consumer price index. The difficulty was in what the consumer price index represented. It was an amalgam of the prices of many different products and was meant to represent the cost of living at a certain time and certain place and compare it to similarly calculated costs of living at other times and places. 

Weatherall attempts to motivate how such a problem is related to gauge theories, but I didn’t understand his argument. The main interesting point is that Weinstein and Malaney apparently found a way to use the mathematics of gauge theory to calculate (at least theoretically) the consumer price index. 

Black-Scholes and Merton: The Black-Scholes equation, the famous options pricing model, is also discussed in the book. I honestly did not understand much about this section of the text (which is fine considering that it is probably extensively well treated elsewhere), other than the idea that the equation is based on Osborne’s ideas concerning normally distributed rates rather than the Mandelbrot’s ideas concerning long tailed distributions. (This is apparently because the mathematics of long tailed distributions is easier to contend with)

One point which I found incredibly interesting was the discussion of how the equation was implicated in the 1988 recession. Weatherall claims that the equation had a limited validity which most investors did not heed, and thus when they implemented their trading strategies based on the equation they were working within assumptions that the market did not in reality bare out. (I’m not precisely clear as to what these assumptions were, but they concern the absence of rare events which are better modeled by long-tailed distributions). When the equation was first formulated, however, it did not assume the market would be operating under trading strategies which were modeled by the equation itself. So with many traders employing the equation and using it to develop their own options pricing models, the assumptions of the equations no longer applied. Thus the very fact that so many traders were employing the equation, made the equation itself invalid and thus made the traders blind to an event (like a market crash) which the equation did not predict

The basic idea is that Black and Scholes formulated a model of market conditions which upon being implemented as a trading strategy, effectively changed those market conditions and thus made the original model inapplicable. 

This seems to be a feature of economics in general. There is a feedback loop between market conditions and trading strategies which make the attempts to model the market (and profit from such modeling) a sort of moving target which moves directly in tandem with your attempts to steady your aim. 

(There should be a problem which would allow one to represent this idea in microcosm)

But the idea seems incredibly interesting (at least as a mode of science fiction) assuming it were true to physics. One of the assumptions of studying physical theories is that they are completely independent of us, but imagine if this were not true? Imagine if humans could change the physical laws directly through our attempts to engage with those laws? I’m not talking about the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, but something much stranger. What if by the very act of building something based on physical principles, we could change the principles themselves?

The Prediction Company and Chaos: I unfortunately do not remember the names of the main characters in this section (It’s Packard and Farmer). Unlike most of the other men (and they are all, besides Malaney, men), the future members of  The Prediction Company did not strive to develop an overarching theory of the market. Rather they used ideas from Chaos to develop short term trading strategies which could quickly profit from unstable market conditions. 

The original founders of the company were physicists and were inspired by a young physics post-grad who lived in their small town for a few years when they were teenagers. 

Quotes
“If physicists have been successful at improving our understanding of finance, it is because they have approached problems in a novel way, using methodological insights that are commonplace in physics (and engineering) and that are useful in studying virtually anything…one uses simplifying assumptions to make a problem tractable and solve it. Then, once you see how your solution works, you can double back and begin asking what happens when you play with your assumptions. Sometimes you realize that your original solution is no good, because it depends too heavily on assumptions that never really apply; other times, you discover that the solution is pretty good but can be improved in simple ways; and other times still you realize that your solution is great under certain circumstances, but you need to think about what to do when those circumstances don’t apply.”
- pg 209

“But putting all of the blame for the 2007-2008 crisis on Li’s model or even securitized consumer loans, is a mistake. The crisis was partly a failure of mathematical modeling. But even more, it was a failure of some very sophisticated financial institutions to think like physicists. The model worked well under some conditions, but like any mathematical model, it failed when its assumptions ceased to hold. And it seems the people who were empowered to make decisions about risk management didn’t think through when Li’s model would fail them. Everyone was making money, and so they threw caution to the winds. But even this is too easy. The crisis was equally a failure of government policy and regulation, since the shadow banking system that collapsed ran with essentially no oversight. Either regulators didn’t know what was happening, they didn’t understand the risks, or they believed that the industry would regulate itself. The crisis resulted from failures on all fronts.”

East of Eden

At such a time it seems natural and good to me to ask myself these questions. What do I believe in? What must I fight for and what must I fight against?

Our species is the only creative species, and it has only one creative instrument, the individual mind and spirit of a man. Nothing was ever created by two men. There are no good collaborations, whether in music, in art, in poetry, in mathematics, in philosophy. Once the miracle of creation has taken place, the group can build and extend it, but the group never invents anything. The preciousness lies in the lonely mind of a man.

And now the forces marshaled around the concept of the group have declared a war of extermination on the preciousness, the mind of man. By disparagement, by starvation, by repressions, forced direction, and the stunning hammerblows of conditioning, the free, roving mind is being pursued, roped, blunted, drugged. It is a sad suicidal course our species seems to have taken.

And this I believe: that the free, exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable thing in the world. And this I would fight for: the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes, undirected. And this I must fight against: any idea, religion, or government which limits or destroys the individual. This is what I am and what I am about. I can understand why a system built on a pattern must try to destroy the free mind, for this is one thing which can by inspection destroy such a system. Surely I can understand this, and I hate it and I will fight against it to preserve the one thing that separates us from the uncreative beasts. If the glory can be killed, we are lost.

The Parable of the Sower Octavia Butler

“It’s better to teach people than to scare them, Lauren. If you scare them and nothing happens, they lose their fear, and you lose some of your authority with them. It’s harder to scare them a second time, harder to teach them, harder to win back their trust. Best to begin by teaching.”

“Sometimes naming a thing—giving it a name or discovering its name—helps one begin to understand it.”

psychologically. the concept of it.
it's cool if you like that sort of thing, though. I can deal.
Amy 11:09 pm
hahaha
hahaha
there's no only slightly suggestive thing to come back with there
but it is really that you thought that episode would be particularly distressing?
Me 11:11 pm
More that I followed the recommendation that the episode would be a bad one to start with
Now that I know the series better I'd probably be fine watching it, except I know the "conceit"
or is it one of those journey beats destination, kind of episodes?
Amy 11:12 pm
ha yes exact;y

i didn't know anything about the series
so i had a moment of sheer delight once i realized it
haha
like oooooh they're going there

Teaching Lessons

Teaching Students to Ask Questions

Try to connect the lesson to something the students care about: In one of the last lectures in Physics S10, you tried to motivate the process of asking questions by using an example of someone who wants to know how much of your body weight you lift when you do a push up. This was something you certainly cared about, but it wasn’t really something your students cared about. The Saturn’s Rings example would have been better. 

	- Will students not bound for grad school appreciate the less-well defined approach? “Cynically many of you are just here because you want to put quantum mechanics on your transcript, or because this is part of the required courses for a physics degree. But teachers have an obligation to teach material and skills that they believe the next generation of students should have. So independent of your claimed goals for being here, I’ll have to teach you in the direction of something more fundamental than what appears immediately serviceable to your careers.”

		- In other words, they will have to (or I will try really hard to make them to). It’s an important collection of skills for students to have, and I will be doing a disservice to them and myself if I do not try to teach it. 


Demand legibility as an aspect of grading: For the courses you teach, you need to tell students (from the beginning) that if you cannot read their solution you will hand it back to them. Looking through the solutions and handing them back immediately when you receive them will probably add some social pressure for the students to write neatly. 

	- Rationale: A student who rushes to write his solution and doesn’t care about legibility saves, say, 30 minutes of his own time and wastes 15 minutes of the graders time. But if every student rushed in this way, they will each be saving a small amount of time for themselves, and wasting a relatively larger portion of the grader’s time. SO, each student not being special, they should all take the time to write neatly so as not to waste the grader’s time. 

Getting students to ask questions: One of the skills which are not often practiced in physics classes is asking questions. How would you get students to ask questions? 
	- Incorporate questions into assignments early, by letting students ask questions about systems they already understand. (e.g., in a quantum mechanics course have them ask questions about class mech., before they start asking questions about quantum mechanics)

	- Have more flexible assignments in which if a student cannot solve the stated problem, they can propose another. 


Building Up to Less-Defined Problems: One issue with getting students to work on less-defined problems, is that such problems combine the analytic difficulty of well-defined problems with the uncertainty of trying to answer a question you do not know precisely how to formulate. How then do you instruct students who don’t even know how to solve well-defined problems. 

	- Simultaneous Skill Building: One idea is to try to build the skills simultaneously. Have students practice asking questions about well-defined problems while they’re working on the problems themselves. (e.g., the ‘what is the question’ problem you gave to students in Physics S10)

	-  Training Wheels Problems: Another idea is the training wheels approach. As more and more material is added to the course, you reintroduce and practice older material by placing it in less-defined contexts. For example, you can begin with a very well-defined problem on the infinite potential well and then over time, remove definitions so students can create their own. 
	
	- Example quantum mechanics questions: What questions would you need to be able to answer before you could answer the main question/solve the main problem? What are possible answers to that question. 
	

Grading Less-Defined Problems: Grading less defined problems would be a lot like grading essays. It would require the grader to be flexible in how he judged the quality of a submission, and he would have to assign them less often in order to not rush in grading them. The feedback should not merely be a checkmark or a number of points, but commentary on the structure of the solution and on the quality of the logical argument.

Gravity and Quantum Mechanics
There seems to be a sense in which gravity and quantum mechanics know about each other. That the existence of one implies, for some necessary physical consistency in a typically unexplored regime the existence of the other. 

Gaussians and Renormalization or Toy model of  Renormalization or Baby Renormalization Group
The basic idea behind renormalization does not require quantum field theory, statistical field theory, or even statistical mechanics. The essence of the idea concerns how the physical properties of a fundamental theory change when we study the theory on larger length scales (or lower energy scales). This change is most often represented in terms of a beta function which defines how the parameters of the theory change when we change the aforementioned scale. The historically significant examples of beta functions includ those describing vacuum polarization (or, asymptotic slavery) referring to the increase in electric charge as we move closer and closer to the electron, or asymptotic freedom referring to the decrease in color charge as we move closer and closer to quarks. 

In this problem we study a simple gaussian model of renormalization which allows us to see 

In the typical renormalization procedure we integrate out certain degrees of freedom of a system in order to move to a larger length scale. The resulting system defines a new theory whose parameters can be related to the parameters of the original theory through a renormalization group transformation. In this problem we compute this renormalization group transformation in a gaussian based toy model.

Newton and the Mint

Leonardo and the State

“In Leonardo’s time, Italian cities were fighting not only the French but also each other. Leonardo was a pacifist, but he was also a product of his environment, recognizing that the wealthy patrons who supported him had more use for military machines than for paintings.”
— Quote Taken From Da Vinci Exhibition in the Museum of Science

I saw this quote about a month ago, when Jiwon and I visited the Museum of Science. It jumped out at me as a mostly weak rationalization for an inventor to use the state to finance his work. Da Vinci made many prototypes for canons and chariots. To what extent could someone be claimed to be a pacifist, if he willingly commits his expertise to use by explicitly not-pacifist regimes, states, or powers? Why not simply say he is, like most humans, avowedly moral only when it is not inconvenient?

Scientists—our modern conceptions of them and their more ancient antecedents—are perhaps just as inured to the influences of power and money as the rest of us. So perhaps it is not a surprise that given the opportunity to avail themselves of the privileges which come with highly sought after resources, they willingly skirt the moral dimensions which implicate said resources in imperialist power structures. 

In his later years, Newton worked for the Royal Mint in England, pursuing many counterfeiters and sending many of them to their death. I’m currently reading Nasar’s biography of John Nash, and throughout their are many instances of mathematicians and scientists providing their skills to the U.S. government to help solve some international related problem. Of course there is the Manhattan project, and all the scientists who worked on building the Hydrogen Bomb. But there were also the scientists like Nash, Von Neumann, and (Lloyd) Shapley who worked on cold war game theory scenarios. So perhaps this is the norm: Famous scientists/intellectuals of their time aligning themselves with the states and institutions of power to function largely as vassals of that power. 

But then of course there is Jeff Schmidt’s book which appears to be such a radical departure from this tendency. He, as a physicist, argues that the apolitical nature of education contributes to the tendency of scientists to willingly fall into hierarchical power structures which validate their roles in society at the expense of questioning the principles of the society itself. He suggests that this is not the way it has to be, and if it is indeed true that capitalistic systems of governance are not as unquestionably beneficial to the the world as heads of state and commerce want us to believe, then it is our duty as people—regardless of our technocratic status—to not merely incorporate ourselves within (and hence propagate) the system but to interrogate it and if necessary work to find a better one. 

This long term view of society and its structure is not typical for anyone who is alive today. Perhaps then it is exceedingly necessary.

Classes

I am trying to determine whether I should take any classes this semester. It is not a simple question for me. I am trying to recognize it simultaneously as the difficult weighty decision it is and to not be overwhelmed by the prospects of making the wrong choice. The constraints are manifold: I am a TF for Physics 143A (Harvard’s undergraduate quantum course); I am doing research in Shakhnovich’s group; I would likely want to teach my own course this summer which means I need to take the time to prepare for the course; I will be attending two conferences during the semester. These are the supposedly non-negotiable commitments which make any additional obligations unwise. In the past I have been forced to negotiate competing obligations and sometimes I am able to manage them (as I did in the Spring of 2013) and sometimes I am not (as I wasn’t able to in the Fall of 2011). Although in both cases the nature of the commitments did not destroy me completely and I managed to learn something even in spite of my failure to be successful in all directions. 

So although I recognize that my workload is perhaps work enough, I also recognize that this would be the second semester I go through Harvard without taking any courses. Surely, I say to myself, I should be availing myself of the educational resources at this institution. But from this acknowledgement I am at a loss as to what direction to pursue. I always claimed to want to take more courses on computation, so why not a computational course? I could try to improve my writing through an advanced essay writing course? What about a more abstract mathematics course to supplement my future work on more abstract topics? There are so many directions to go all of which lead me to some unknown future and I do not know which to select, do not know if any selection would be a good idea. 

This writing was intended to help me through this confusion, but it is only clarifying the extent of the confusion. The quote from Burr stands out to me: Make whatever decision you need to make with the knowledge that indecision, the default path, is likely the worst decision of all. And of course there are the stories in my past which encourage courage in the face of fear, and suggest that I should have some sort of faith in myself. But then again these are just courses. How do they really fit in with any attempt to realize that strange thing called identity?

From Authority and American Usage by David Foster Wallace

“This reviewer’s own humble opinion is that some of the cultural and political realities of American life are themselves racially insensitive and elitist and offensive and unfair, and that pussyfooting around these realities with euphemistic doublespeak is not only hypocritical but toxic to the project of ever really changing them.”
- ~ 80% through article

"It probably isn't the whole explanation, but as with the voguish hypocrisy of Politically Correct English, the obscurity and pretension of Academic English can be attributed in part to a disruption in the delicate rhetorical balance between language as a vector of meaning and language as a vector of the writer's own resumé. In other words, it is when a scholar's vanity/insecurity leads him to write primarily to communicate and reinforce his own status as an Intellectual that his English is deformed by pleonasm and pretentious diction (whose function is to signal the writer's erudition) and by opaque abstraction (whose function is to keep anybody from pinning the writer down to a definitive assertion that may be refuted or shown to be silly). The latter characteristic, a level of obscurity that often makes it just about impossible to figure out what an AE sentence is really saying, so closely resembles the political and corporate double speak (“revenue enhancement,” “downsizing,” “proactive resource-allocation restructuring”) that it’s tempting to think AE’s real purpose is concealment and its real motivation fear.”

Assignment Draft for Class

Perhaps I’m atypical in this direction, but I for one never once fantasized about sleeping with my one of my instructors. From the time I started having theses kinds of fantasies until now, my waking dreams mostly involved people I reasonable had a chance with. I mean people could talk and moan and profess a desire to wake up next to Beyoncé, Chris Hemsworth, or (Insert Famous Celebrity Crush), but who really lets such fantasies filter into the actual fantasies of night time. It would be time wasted really, to spend your time fantasizing about being with people you could never really be with. Teachers occupied a similar category; much less hallowed and famous and celebrated than the gods/goddesses of the entertainment industry but no much more a part of my world than these gods/goddesses were. We weren’t even really in the same league, you know. 

And yet Klipnis(sp?) is suggesting that back in her day these fantasies and their real-world counterparts were common place. And you know what? It was perfectly OK. No one claimed victimization. No one shouted “patriarchy”. No one was so feeble as to feel they were being taken advantage of.  I read a similar argument long ago, which claimed the intellectual was inseparable from the sexual and that it was consequently impossible for someone to be intellectually stimulated without, on some (even subliminal) level, being sexually stimulated as well. Utter nonsense, I believed, something you could imagine a male professor saying as a defense for why he absolutely had no will to fight off the throng of underclasswomen who flung/beseiged him themselves at him without rest, so much so that he had to give in and respond to at least one, because how could just one really hurt anyone, especially when that one wanted it so badly? But actually this theory was promulgated by a woman, which to my culturally tinged/reflexive ears unfortunately lends much to its credibility. I mean if this theory wasn’t penned by the ironically hyper-sexualized, and de-masculinized dandies of male academia, then surely there must be some truth in this external perspective. 

Surely. Klipnis is arguing something a little different though. She’s not suggesting a connection between the intellectual and the sexual, but something more basic. Professors are people, students are people, and people tend to be attracted to each other. Ergo…Well, you get the idea. Key to her argument is that the power differential which is the supposed complication of—and common rebuttal to allowing—such attractions does not in fact exist. Professors who are not teaching the students they want to date have no unambiguous method of influencing said students and affecting their future. In fact, Klipnis claims, the power differential is slanted in the opposite direction with students seemingly having more power to negatively affect the careers and livelihood (I mean real stuff; none of that squishy psychological trauma bullshit) of their professors. The real culprit of sexual assaults on campuses is fraternities, or more generally immature, horny, and entitled men (like, for example, America’s current President).   

—— Second Draft

Now perhaps I’m atypical in this direction, but I never once fantasized about sleeping with one of my teachers. For one, many of these teachers were my parents age or older, but, more importantly, from the moment I started having that class of pubescent fantasies, they mostly involved people I had—or at least thought I had—a reasonable chance with. You know: my partner in the U.S. History class; Cute girl with braids in gym. Normal people. Because let’s be honest. A guy could talk to his boys about wanting to wake up next to Beyoncé or Scarlett Johansen, but who really would waste his time fantasizing about being with such people, people who neither in this universe nor the next you ever really had a chance of being with. In my mind teachers occupied a similar realm, one much less celebrated than the one containing the gods and goddesses of the entertainment industry but no less remote. Students and teachers were worlds apart, not even close to being star-crossed given that they seemed to occupy different skies. 

And yet in “Sexual Paranoia” [1] Kipnis claims that back in her day such fantasies and their real-world counterparts were common place. And you know what else? It all turned out OK. No one had their life ruined. No one was so feeble as to feel they were being intentionally victimized. No one shouted “Patriarchy!”. Students and professors engaged in many libidinous but fairly innocuous relationships which are common to people who share intellectual or work level interests. 

Some time ago I read a similar argument for normalizing professor-student relationships: An academic claimed that the Intellectual was inseparable from the Sexual and that it was thus impossible for someone to be intellectually stimulated without being on some (possibly subliminal) level sexually stimulated as well. Hogwash, I had thought. I mean, really, how slimy could you get? This sexual-intellectual coupling was too easily something one could imagine a male professor saying as a defense for why he absolutely had no will nor reason to fight off the throng of hungry and eager underclass women who besieged him daily. I mean if the sexual was indeed related to the intellectual should not the sexual be a part of a student’s education as well? And so shouldn’t this professor “educate” the willing student, especially when they so clearly wanted it so badly? Unfortunately, my automatic reaction was unjustified. This “sexual-intellectual” hypothesis was promulgated by a woman [2], a fact which to my culturally reflexive ears immediately lent much to its credibility. Not being penned by the paradoxically hyper-sexualized and de-masculinized dandies of male academia, perhaps there may be be some truth to this perspective?

Maybe. With regard to Kipnis’s argument, I think at the level of ethos it too benefits from her position as a specifically woman professor, but she is actually arguing something a little different, something more basic. Her argument (in a possibly bastardized form) for the inevitability of professor-student relationships is as follows: Professors are people; Students are People; People tend to be attracted to each other. Ergo…Well you get the idea. Underlying her argument is that the power differential which is the supposed complication of—and common rebuttal to allowing—such attractions to develop does not in fact exist. Professors who are not teaching the students they want to date have no unambiguous method of influencing said students’ future. In fact, Kipnis claims, the power differential is slanted in the opposite direction with students seemingly having more power to negatively affect the careers and livelihoods— you know, “real stuff”; none of that squishy psychological trauma bullshit—of their professors. Moreover, she concludes the real culprit of sexual assaults on campus is fraternities, or, more generally, immature, horny, and entitled men among whom our current president serves as a fitting archetype.

It’s easier for me to talk about my weaknesses than my strengths and easier still to talk about my goals. 

Through this class, I want to move closer to completing a few essay projects I’ve had in the back of my mind. My hope is this class will create a community where shame and social pressure (in addition to, of course, joy and love) could adequately encourage me to devote a few extra minutes each day to working on those writings. And I don’t want to be a Cynical Cynthia about this, but I’m not entirely sure my strengths are indeed strengths given that they appear sporadically and without warning.  I’ve been told I write “good sentences”, and although it is true that if I write enough words a good string of them usually emerges eventually, I’m not really consistent about it. So consistency is something I’d really like to work on: being able to more reliably write not only good sentences, but good paragraphs, and (Universe willing) good essays. Also, I can so far manage writing short (~3 page) essays. Beyond this page limit, my arguments and narratives can get confused and contradictory. So, I also want to be able to structure longer (i.e., +30 page), and yet still coherent, essays 



The purpose of the problem sets is for you to apply some of your knowledge through problem contexts similar to ones you’ll encounter outside this course. 

For example, if you were to ask me a question and I could only respond by writing mathematical symbols then it wouldn’t be clear what interpretation I associate with those symbols. 

We use your solutions to them to get a sense of what you understand, and although symbolic manipulation In general, it’s arguably difficult to know for sure how fare your understanding reaches, but we can definitely get a better sense of what you understand if you. 

We use your solutions to get a sense of what you understand about the material, and although symbolic manipulation conveys some understanding, the presence of the correct symbols does not directly suggest you understand what you’re doing or why you’re doing it. To convey the what and the why you need explanations 

I’ve told the grader that the solutions #2 and #3 in the attached document bracket what’s expected. In the document, solution #3 is over complete, while the solution # 2 is under-complete (not to mention logically inconsistent), so you should strive for something in between.

Linearity and Solubility

Anyone who has spent some enough time studying physics would begin to recognize some patterns in the fundamental equations of physics. All of these equations have a 

If you’

The common student misconception that physics is isomorphic to mathematics has to be forgiven when one stops to consider how important logical deduction is in physics. But ever before one can deduce result $B$ from the principal $A$, one most first postulate $A$, and one of the things which separates physics from mathematics is that the principles of a theory (i.e., the $A$s) have to be developed from physical reasoning. However, these principles are not arbitrary and across physics (from electrodynamics to quantum mechanics) their mathematical representations  all have a common form. 

  In physics, our $A$ stands for all the physical principles of a theory and $B$ stands for the predictions we derive from these principles. And if one reviews the mathematical forms of the principles of physics (from the Lorentz Force Law, to the Schrodinger equation), one finds that they all have a common form. 

Namely, if $F(t, \tbf{x})$ is the dynamical variable (or, more generally, state) of interest in our system (e.g., a vector in Hilbert space or a classical field), then the equation which governs $F(t, \tbf{x})$’s dynamics in space and/or time has the form

(Equation with labeled entries)

The source function $\Omega$ is responsible for generating the non-trivial dynamics of $F(t, \tbf{x})$. 
We should note that $\hat{D}$ cannot in reality be \textit{any} differential operator, but its form is constrained by fundamental symmetries and the independent variables relevant in our system. Also the source function $\Omega(F, t, \tbf{x})$, in certain physical regimes, can also have derivative operator terms and nonlinear terms which are physically dominant over the term $\hat{D} F$. 

Some equations and their associated field of physics which bear this form are 
Maxwell’s Equations - Electrodynamics
Klein Gordon Equation - Classical Field Theory
Schrodinger Equation - Quantum Mechanics
Newton’s Second Law - Classical mechanics
Linearized Einstein’s Equations - General Relativity
Master Equation - Non-equilibrium Statistical Physics

Now the fact that 

is often the starting

If you’ve taken a few courses in physics you’ve been exposed to many different dynamical equations (also known as “equations of motion”) all of which have a common form. Often we have some dynamical


Related to this general form of dynamical equations are three mini-motifs which occur throughout physics:


 We will consider a non-physics example of perturbation theory (which still bears much of the properties of perturbation theory in all areas of physics from classical mechanics to quantum field theory)

Harmonic Oscillator is Everywhere

(coleman quote)

The general form of fundamental equations in physics is connected to another motif in physics: the seemingly ever constant presence of the harmonic oscillator. More generally, not only are oscillating system ubiquitous in physics but so too are decaying systems, and together these two types of phenomena result from a common property of fundamental equations of the form (). 

(Paragraph Break)

For such equations, if we study the system they model at low energies or near their equilibrium (i.e., constant in time) configurations, we can linearize the equation such that the dynamical variable $F$ appears at most to first order. 

(Linearized Equation)

It is generally known in analysis that when differential equations are linear their solutions are linear combinations of complex exponentials. Complex exponentials in turn are composed of sinusoids and/or exponential with real arguments. Thus, so many systems in physics can be studied as oscillations and decays in time and space, because the equations which model them are (in certain physical limits) linear.  

(Paragraph Break)

To explain the ubiquity of the standard quadratic-form potential of the dynamical variable (i.e., $U(F(t,\tbf{x})) = \frac{\alpha}{2} F(t, \tbf{x})^2 + \cdots$) we need to consider energy. From the lagrangian formalism of physics, we know that a dynamical equation is linear in the dynamical variable, if and only if its associated energy is quadratic in the dynamical variable (assuming the dynamical variable has a clear interpretation in terms of energy). Thus, the “harmonic oscillator” potential is also connected to the fact that dynamical equations at low energy/near equilibrium can be linearized.

This dual argument for the ubiquity of harmonic oscillators (and decays) is as follows

(Figure Summary)

(mention that in quantum mechanics, the defining dynamical equation is always linear in the state ket (outside of some effective problems in nonlinear optics) which is why the complex exponential e^{-i E t/\hbar} is so every present)

these  dynamical variable written to first order 


The linearity of fundamental equations in physics is connected to another common trend/result/idea in physics, the ever presence of oscillations and decays. Some people only depict this as the ubiquity of harmonic oscillators, but exponentially damped systems are similarly ubiquitous for similar reasons. 

Physical systems are near equilibrium (i.e., state where there is no appreciable/important time dynamics)

To study the near equilibrium behavior we posit linear dynamical equations

Physical systems are governed by linear equations

Linear equations have complex exponential solutions

Complex exponential solutions are equivalent to exponentially decaying and/or sinusoidally oscillating solutions. 


Physical systems near equilibrium, Fundamental Equations can be approximated as linear, Linear differential equations have complex exponential solutions, 



(The reasoning here is somewhat circular: We get oscillations and decays because our fundamental equations of physics are linear (at least in some approximation), and we know that they are linear because they describe stable/near equilibrium systems, but we specifically choose linear equations to describe stable/near equilibrium systems because we know that these equations yield oscillation and decay solutions)

(Better reasoning/explanation?)

Superposition 

A general property of linear differential equations/dynamical equations is that they often have multiple solutions, and the most general form of their solution is a linear combination of the individual solutions. We call this the superposition property. This property is relevant, for example, in electrodynamics in which the net electric (and magnetic) field in a system is sum of the individual fields which contribute to it. If this were not the case we could not simply assume that the net electric field of a distribution of electrons was the sum of the electric fields of each individual electron \footnote{That physically important quantities are equivalent to the sum of the contributions from their individual parts, may seem obvious but it is not generally true. For example, the total energy of a net electric field is \textit{not} the sum of the energies of each individual field. Also, in quantum physics probabilities are nonlinear (i.e., modulus squared) functions of probability amplitudes, which makes the phases between solutions physically relevant and leads to many of the unique properties of quantum systems.}

(Figure defining superposition of two solutions)

Superposition however can be problematic. In many problems where a linear dynamical equation is the starting point, a solution to this equation is labeled by a \textit{mode} (often identified by the wave number of the complex exponential solution) and to obtain a physical result we sum over the contributions to that physical result from each mode. This works just fine in the classical physics of fields and continuous media, but in quantum field theory this mode summation leads to the famous divergences of clearly finite physical results. 

(Equation for the finite energy/density of a classical field) (Equation for the infinite energy density of a photon)

Energy of a Classical Electromagnetic field

Energy of a Quantum Electromagnetic Field


Nonlinearity and Perturbation
It goes without saying that not all the fundamental equations of physics are linear, and yet we are still able to obtain useful results from them. This is because even when an equation is nonlinear we can often approximate it as linear and then solve it iteratively in terms of solutions to the linear equation.

Thus ubiquity of linear equations in physics is connected to the ubiquity of \textit{perturbation theory}, the general set of techniques used to solve nonlinear equations in terms of the solutions to their linear approximations. As an example of perturbation theory, let’s solve an insoluble\footnote{Of course cubic equations are also generally soluble, but let’s assume we didn’t know this.} cubic equation which becomes a soluble quadratic in a certain limit.  This is a non-physics example, but it still bears much of the features of perturbation theory in all areas of physics ranging from classical mechanics to quantum field theory. 

We begin with the equation

(Equation with perturbation on right)

where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\varepsilon$ are all positive numbers. We take $\varepsilon\ll 1$, and assume that the solution to (), can be written as an expansion in $\varepsilon$

(stated expansion)

The standard approach in perturbation theory is to substitute our perturbation series \textit{ansatz} into the equation we’re trying to solve and then match terms of the same order in our perturbation parameter on both sides of the equality. In this case, substituting () into (), and matching coefficients of the same order as $\varepsilon$ on both sides of the equality we find the system of equations

with the solution (to second order in $\varepsilon$)

This solution bears two of the main features of general perturbative solutions to problems in physics: corrections to the non-perturbative solution are written as a power series in the perturbation parameter; higher order corrections are written in terms of the unperturbed solution. 


Footnote:
You might complain that here our unperturbed (i.e., $\varepsilon =0$) equation is actually nonlinear since it is quadratic, but any quadratic equation can in fact be mapped onto (and is thus equivalent to) two linear equations so the unperturbed system is indeed linear.


Take away


We sum over the 

 may seem obvious but it is in not generally true that physical quantities are linear. For example 


The fact that in quantum mechanics probabilities are nonlinear (i.e., modulus squared) functions of probability amplitudes makes the phases between solutions physically relevant and leads to many of the unique results in quantum mechanics. 


The fact that in quantum mechanics probabilities are nonlinear (i.e., modulus squared) functions of probability amplitudes leads to many of the unique results in quantum mechanics. 



The utility of superposition also stems from the linearity of equations. It is typically more relevant in systems which can be described by waves. 

We have summations over modes in physics because we’re summing over the possible solutions to a linear equation (weighted by some coefficient) in order to obtain a general solution.

Notes for Social Justice Group

Jonathan Haidt: Truth or Social Justice


Marx: “The point of a university is to change the world.”

Mills: “The point of a university is to understand the world.”

Ultimate question: What is the university’s role in responding to social and political context of the surrounding society? Should it attempt to correct those problems, or do attempts to correct those problems, obfuscate the true role of universities as producer’s of knowledge?


Telos
Institutions have their own Telos and society functions best when these institutions pursue their Telos. 

Destructive interactions: One filed injects its Telos into another. Business and scholarship, Business and medicine. But also social justice and scholarhsip

Motivated Reasoning

There is no institutional disconfirmation. Because there are people on the same side. 
Then again if you think the other side is wrong, why would you take their views into account? (Should a physics department in the early 20th century include both die hard classicalist and die hard quantum physicists?) Is this a strawman?

presumes conservative leanings are equally valid compared to liberal leanings. Is this true? False relativism? There are two sides to a debate so they are equally valid and deserve equal components in the argument? Is that true.

Problems
Orthodox views become strongly held and weakly supported
Students are afraid to disagree
Students become intellectually fragile. They cannot take challenges; leads to dis-invitation of banning speakers
For professors: Fear of students. Waste of resources. 

(I agree with the problems but not his solutions)

Sacredness
All groups have sacred virtues around which they circle. 

	University previously held truth to be the sacred virtue. 

Since the 1990s, now the most sacred thing is the victim:
1) Blacks 2) Women 3) LGBT 4)Latios 5)Native Americans 6) Disabilities
Since 2014: 7) Muslim groups 8) Transgender Issues 9) Black Lives Matter

You know something is sacred when any little affront issues a huge reaction
	- On the right: American Flag, Bible
	- On the left: MLK
- Leads to polarization. 


Anti-Fragility
Culture of Victimhood: 
	- One characterized by concern with status and sensitivity to slight combined with a heavy reliance on third parties. People are intolerant of insults, even unintentional, and react by bringing them to the attention of authorities. Rather than emphasize their strength, the aggrieved emphasize their own oppression and marginalization. 

Gain status by either being a victim or standing up for victims. Signaling. 

Example
	- Emory January 2016: Someone wrote Trump 2016 and students demanded that the President of the University take action. 

Problems
	- Victimhood teaches students to divide people into good and evil groups (everyone else vs. white men)
	- Walking on egg shells, self censoring
	- Leads to creating safety culture. Demands the need for protection. 
	- Net Effect: The people you are trying to help are made equal

- Anti-Fragile system: One that increases in capability, resilience, or robustness as a result of mistakes, faults, attacks, or failures. 


Blasphemy
- Liberals have sacred virtues which are not open to refutation or even questioning. 
	Example: 
- Summers violated the sacredness of sexism, refusals to blame the victim, and no differences in ability between groups. 
- Liberals and conservatives agree on the problems in education, but they disagree on the best ways to achieve the solution. (Left’s preferred causes: economic changes, rigged political system, systematic racism; Right’s preferred causes: Decline of marriage, dependence or loss of agency, poor personal choices)
— Social science is hard: no experiments, there is multi causality. 
	- At SJU: You can’t use certain tools because you can’t discuss certain things. 


Correlation (does not imply Causation); Data does not have transparent interpretation
Are gender and racial disparities in Silicon Valley tech jobs evidence of discrimination?
Or of gender differences in career interests? 
Men are worse at empathizing, reading emotion. Explains why women dominate caring professions. 
Abby’s question (Not why are there so few underrepresented minorities; why are they so many white men?)
Haidt’s question: At one point do you say “Until women are 50% of everything, it’s sexism”? Is this a logical conclusion?
Deeper Problem: Correlation 
At SJU: “If group X is underrepresented, it proves (or strongly suggests) that there is systematic or structural discrimination against group X”
Disparate outcomes (correlation) do not imply disparate treatment (Causation). It is an invitation to look more closely. 
Haidt is essentially saying SJW should improve their arguments. 

Justice
Justice is what love looks like in public—Cornel West
Equity Theory (Justice Defined)
(your outcome)/(your input) = (Alice outcome)/(Alice input) = (Bob outcome)/(Bob input)
Equality 
(Your inputs) = (Alice inputs) and (of course?) the outcomes should be equal. 
What about 
your inputs > alice inputs > bob inputs: If the outputs are the same is that fair
Definition: Social Justice focuses on disparate treatment of individuals based on category membership, It acts a subset of justice.
Dark Side: Social justice demands equal outcomes for all groups, without concern for inputs or 3rd variables. This is not justice. It overlaps with but is not contained within justice. 

Example
Minneapolis public schools, boys were suspended 10 times more often than girls. Violation of Title IX (prohibits discrimination by gender). DOE tells schools that they must eliminate disparities. New policy: Crackdown on girls to raise suspension rates; go easier on boys to lower rates. (Imagine this with boy -> black/latino and girl -> white/asian)
Above is fictional. But this is real: 2014 Obama administration, cited Civil Rights Act to tell schools they must eliminate disparities. 
“Minneapolis schools work to make suspending children of color more difficult” star tribune.
Black and Latino violation rate > White and Asian violation rate. (Due to possibly racist problems in the society)

Schism 
Activism is incompatible with scholarship. Each university must choose one telos. Brown University can be the vanguard of SJU. University of Chicago can be the vanguard of Truth
Brown University will spend $100 million on inclusion.
UChicago: John Ellison (dean of students) “…we do not support trigger warnings, we do not cancel invited speakers,…we do not condone the creation of intellectual ‘safe spaces’ where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own.” (Aug 16, 2016 NYT)
We’ve already have the schism with regard to religion and truth? Science label something as truth in order to lend it an authority it otherwise would not have. The benefit of sociology 


The problem: Universities have pursued “truth” in the past, and this often lead to them being complicit in existing social orders. As Cornel West says with regard to (some parts of our culture’s valorization of intelligence: “There were many intelligent Nazis.”

The “truth” is the answer to a question.  Social “justice” questions the question itself.

Heterodox Academy: Attempts to affirm viewpoint diversity.

From Elizabeth

OMG Mobo! who are these people who put on this conference!! i feel all alone in the world sometimes! I was told yesterday that my passion for science was hindering my career and I had to stop meandering around and perhaps I should consider getting a master's in business. And when I went to Stony Brook I was crazy about this idea of the metric and the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics and every time I talked about this everyone looked at me like I was crazy!!

Reductionism, ad absurdum?
this is totally true. I think reductionism has gone to absurd lengths and I think a lot of directions particle physics has gone in are for historical reasons and don't have much relevance today.

I also think there are a lot of concepts in physics that people do not feel comfortable discussing and there is a culture around conceptualizing physics in a certain way to be correct.

Also I totally think the speed of light is an interaction limit which maximizes the entanglement entropy from particles (have you heard of the Bekenstein bound?) And I totally think gravity is an entropic force and I think particle physics and even dynamics could be rethought of in terms of information theory. I have a lot of articles on this topic if you are interested. Did you know that Boltzmann killed himself and put his his entropy law on his tombstone? He was so badass.

I also think the mystifying language used in particle physics makes the concepts seems so "revolutionary" every time and it prevents people from seeing connections that were already there. Basically I think there is a lot of oppression going on in physics, especially theoretical physics and its limiting the exchange of ideas. I see a lot of good physicists go to other departments, and although correlated with limited funding, I think it is often because of the environment. There is such an ego in physics and there have been some experiments which show people perform physics tasks better when they are done anonymously. Science should be done in a selfless way and we are butchering the physics by putting our names on all of these things inherent in nature! I am glad to see other people organizing to discuss these things because I have been told that simply stating my opinion is offensive and I should have more humility. 

Have a great time in Austria! That sounds like a lot of fun.

In Dorfgastein

Dear Amy, 
You are thousands of miles away and thoughts of you still float through my head. I have now been in Dorfgastein, Austria for four days and my time in the Rethinking Physics Workshop is more than half gone. As I type now, I am overlooking the mountainous hills near the cabin I haven’t left in days. 

You would love it here. The workshop/conference/getaway is structured around talks and discussion sessions. Each day three people present a topic on some area of philosophy, mathematics, or physics and then the rest of the day we all form smaller groups to talk about some of the ideas presented in the talks. The discussion sessions are vey much like the conversations you and I have. They attempt to understand and deconstruct what it means to understand a topic that most people take for granted as well understood, or not worth investigation. So (Lucy and Sofia) far we have talked about whether causality was a fundamental property of physical systems, and what type of causal structures we expect in physical theories. Two people (Pau and Pierre) have given (in my mind) barely comprehensible (but interesting!) talks about category theory. Someone (Vaclov) has discussed classical attempts to develop a unified field theory built using the language of geometric algebra. Someone else (Sina) discussed whether it was correct to consider quantum mechanics as non-deterministic. He rather claimed it was “not-completely” deterministic and proposed the original idea that like in thermodynamics, the “non-determinism” in quantum mechanics arises from incomplete knowledge of the initial conditions of the system (Someone—Robin—disagreed with this characterization and argued that the non-determinism arises from Born’s rule which does not seem to have anything to do with the initial conditions). 

All in all it’s been an interesting few days. It feels somewhat surreal to be here given that less than three years ago I was in New Orleans questioning my attachment to physics and to life. It seems as though since then something in me has vanished, and I have been walking through a dream in the mean time. In five days I will see you again, and this self-written letter will, I’m sure, seem less crazy then. I will be thinking about you in the mean time. 

Love,
Mobolaji

Vacuum and Nothingness - Minutes
Sofia: Conceptual difficulties in learning QFT: Fields have underlying degrees of freedom but we are not absolutely sure what they are. 
Can we think of the underlying degrees of freedom of a field as a physical thing.
Example/Analogy: In water waves and sound waves the underlying degrees of freedom 
Niels: Contradictory notions of nothingness
What are the philosophical notions of nothingness? It’s not the quantum vacuum, so what is it? 
Being emergent is not the same thing as being nothing
Flavio: What are more correct characterizations/uses of nothing
We should call the vacuum the ground state of a theory?
Particle in a box. Remove the particles and you still have the box so you still have something from which spacetime can emerge
Relationship between not existing, nothingness, and emptiness
Diego and John: What is a precise definition of nothingness?
Lucy: Follows Niels’s desires/points
Uther: What is the idea of a ground state and how does it relate to the underlying spacetime structure. 

Inflationary Universe: From Sofia’s friend “Think of inflation as spacetime being created.”
Matter field 
Flavio’s Point: In the inflationary perspective the spacetime is being created when the universe is being created
Niels’s argument: If we consider the universe to be infinite, then assuming that spacetime is created at the big bang seems contradictory. How can an infinite universe expand in a finite time from an initially finite spacetime?
Possibly an argument for why spacetime (possibly Minkowskian) existed before the big bang. 
		- Possibly an argument for the finiteness of the universe.
Did the universe arise from a singularity
Diego: Initial entropy of the universe was small and finite, and you can’t have this from a singularity. 
Unruh Effect
You have a particle accelerator which is stationary and doesn’t pick up any particles, but then you accelerate it and detect particles. 
Seems to suggest some connection to Einstein’s ideas about acceleration and it’s absoluteness. 

Does underlying degrees of freedom imply Hidden variables?
Namely is having underlying degrees of freedom a contradiction of hidden variables? 
Are hidden variables the same thing as underlying degrees of freedom. 
Conclusion: Underlying degrees of freedom are not hidden variables
 
Energy Time Uncertainty Principle
Is it unrigorous?
Time isn’t an operator. How can we have an uncertainty principle for it?
Maybe we could formulate it with a theory where time is an operator. Consequently get string theory or relativistic quantum mechanics

Problems: Vacuum state and its spontaneous popping out. 

Sofia’s question: Does the quantum vacuum imply the existence of a space time structure. 
The zero-point energy of the vacuum should conceivably curve space time. 
But then again this zero-point energy cannot be calculated. 

Uther: Quantum Field Theory appears to be a local hidden variable model which contradicts accepted understanding of quantum mechanics as a non-local non-hidden variable model. 

Niels: 

Sophia: Are particles localized?

Quantum Field Theory Sucks.

Problem 1
(a): This problem is somewhat open ended. Is the specific property here that the J_+ and J_- states take a |j, m> state to |j, m+/-1>? In the class discussion of the raising and lowering operators, it was also important that there were states for which acting upon them with J_+ or J_- yielded zero. Should this be included in the answer?
(d): Should the students know precisely how the raising and lowering operators act on states? That is, should they know the (coeff) in the standard J_+|j, m>= (coeff)|j, m+1> formula? If not, perhaps it should be provided as an additional formula.

Problem 2
(a): Should students write the unitary operator explicitly, or could they say “the momentum operator is the generator of space-translations”? It would be good to state which one is preferred.
(d): Could students evaluate this commutator using a result and procedure outlined in one of the previous assignments, or do they need to follow the hint? That is could they taylor expand f(x) and use the fact [x^n, p] = ihbar n x^(n-1) (without proof) to show that [f(x), p] = ihbar df/dx?

Problem 3
I assigned a very similar problem in section a few weeks ago. It’s 1b in the attached doc. Also, this problem seems much simpler than the other problems worth 10 points. Perhaps we can connect this question about gaussians to harmonic oscillators?

Problem 4
(e): Should the students know the formula for the reflection and transmission coefficients in terms of the amplitude of the initial wave? Perhaps providing a formula would be useful here. 

But even with the formula this problem seems somewhat difficult. The students have not encountered a scattering problem in an assignment yet which likely means they haven’t thought about such problems to any depth. Also this problem is computationally heavy in that it requires students to deal with a system of six equations in six variables and correctly solve for (and know they should solve for) two ratios between the coefficients, and then finally compute the modulus squared of these ratios. Perhaps a different question involving this potential could be asked?


computation seems somewAlso, when you have a three piecewise potential there is some ambiguity in determining the reflection and transmission coefficients which I don’t think the students have dealt with. 


Hi Eugene, 

Thank you for the discussion on Tuesday. I’ve chosen to not use your credibility to establish the legitimacy of work I initiated and completed. There’s a lot of politicking and superficiality in academia these days which makes research more difficult and I don’t want to contribute to that culture. Moreover, my own academic experience suggests that people are often skeptical of believing I actually completed the work I did and a first paper co-authorship could feed into that skepticism. I’ve told the editors about the change in co-authorship and the change in acknowledgments, and I think they will confirm with you.

Importance of Geometry

Gibbs and Vector Calculus
Differential Forms in Electromagnetism
Geometry in Classical Mechanics
A
Geometry and Energy in Quantum and Gravity

Geometry is one of the oldest fields of mathematics and thus it is perhaps not surprising that the first work of mathematical physics employed geometry as the primary logical language. Although Newton is credited with Newton’s Principia 

Geometry is often latently relevant in physics in ways which do not appear explicitly geometric.

Geometry is often latently relevant in physics in scenarios/ways which make no explicit reference to geometry. Geometry is often latently relevant to physical scenarios which make no explicit reference to geometry.

 For example it is relevant in the very way physical formulas are written. For example, in the mid 20th century Electrodynamics developed largely without the vector notation we find so useful 

Many of the first symmetries noted in physical systems developed in a geometric context. 

Modern development of analytic geometric (the application of the methods of analysis to describe geometric concepts/ideas/results)



Geometry and Energy in Quantum Physics and Geometry

With Einstein’s theory of relativity the notion that energy is physically relevant to geometry was made explicit. 

Our above notions of how geometry is relevant to energy were mostly concerned with how the mathematical representation of energy often has geometric undertones. But Einstein’s theory of relativity  revealed that the geometry of the physical space we and all physical objects occupy is explicitly dependent on the energy density within this region of physical space. Indeed what we experience as the gravity created by a very massive object is “really” just (is depicted as) motion within a curved spacetime caused by the localization of a large amount of energy in a small region of space.

Matters of Authority
In days, a week, or a month I will publish my first journal article. It will be in Physical review E, and I will be listed as the sole author. You might question why this last point deserves mention, why given all of my professed beliefs about the pointlessness of competition and the superficiality of the dick-measuring contest academia has degenerated into I am now seemingly acquiescing to such surface elements and seeking to obtain a measure of identity from them. The way I explain it to myself is with a backward look into my history. I have been working really hard, I tell myself, and the powers that be have not always recognized that work, and I want to make sure (for posterity) that this work in particular is recognized. OK, fine, you might be saying. Put your name on the damn paper. What is the issue? Well, the issue is that the first public version of the paper had both my and Eugene’s names on the paper. 

In the arxiv.org pre print I am listed as first author and Eugene is listed as second author. This authorship choice was mine, not Eugene’s. And back when I first submitted the paper to arxiv, although I had come to Eugene with the inciting problem, had written the paper, completed the calculations, and toiled in the metaphorical trenches myself, I still used some fuzzy reasoning to rationalize to myself this dual attribution. Something having to do with a gratefulness and appreciation for our conversations. Or maybe a belated acceptance of what Jesse had once told me of how science was done. In one of the many awkward conversations we had concerning my attempts to find some breathing space of independence in my work, Jesse mentioned that the work he did on his own and which he was most proud of in his graduate career was hardly cited while seemingly less important work he completed with Nima-Arkani Hamed was more widely read. The lesson was that if my predilection for independence was not checked it could be dangerous to my scientific career because the scientific community is nowhere near as egalitarian and meritocratic as it pretends to be. Back then I subtly rejected Jesse’s conclusions feeling that although we were both at MIT and I was his student, our respective motivations for doing our work were not the same. But perhaps he had planted the seed that only bloomed late.

Or, perhaps, it did not bloom at all. After a week in Austria, away from the cacophony of the Harvard campus and while immersed in conversations concerning the nature of causality and reality in the physical world, I began to consider the causal consequences of my own actions. I realized that I was not in fact OK with bending to Jesse’s sense of how science was completed. Soon afterwards I began to feel an encroaching panic, a sense that I was in a way relinquishing something personally vital and important in order to achieve something less real to me but apparently more real to others. The images that came to my mind were arguably melodramatic. I thought of Mos Def playing Vivien Thomas in Something the Lord Made and I saw myself agreeing to improper attributions simply because I was so thankful to have the opportunity to do work I enjoyed. I thought of Algernon Edwards in The Knick and I saw parallels in my attempts to be accepted by peers with less demonstrated ability. I thought back to Mr. Ferris in the locker room hall of Benjamin Franklin, the counselors and freshman administrators at MIT who sought to help me choose a course load I could “manage”, the failed NSF, NSDEG, and Soros fellowship proposals based on Ariel’s project.  Suddenly I felt that the claimed rewards that people say exist for relinquishing personal values like integrity and honesty were rewards which were only realized for other people. There are those to whom much is promised and little is given, and thus the promise primarily exists to keep the peace and to ensure that those for whom the promise is realized are not called to account for the arbitrarity of the conditions which make them so special. “This is the way the world works. You pay your dues and later on you get the goods.” But for some people in this country this is not and has never been true.

I have to admit there was some mania in these musings. I was falling into what Baldwin purported as one of the unarticulated and fuzzy consequences of racism: being unable to be absolutely sure that you’re experiencing it. I was becoming paranoid, seeing and interpreting every rejection, real and imagined as a direct attack on my right to exist and work the way I choose. 

And I was overcome by this paranoia. When I returned to Cambridge I sent Eugene a poorly worded email informing him of my decision to change the authorship of the paper to better reflect the work I put into it. In the email I awkwardly railed against academia, professed my unique relative integrity, and concluded with something embarrassingly insecure about other people not recognizing my work. The email was a mess, which I will not read again until I gain sufficient distance from it to convincingly pretend it was written by another person. But what it was meant to achieve, was achieved. The authorship for the paper sent to PRE was (or will be) modified and I will be listed as sole author. 

However, there still exists the paper on arxiv, the paper which I posted two months ago and which still lists both Eugene and I as co-authors. I cannot change this authorship arrangement for papers posted on the arxiv cannot ever be completely removed. I could put up a new version with only my name, but arxiv will preserve the previous versions in a link on the updated page,  and I do not want to include two versions of the same paper with two different author lists separated by a single link. I imagine the confusion of the different author lists would bring about the exact thing the sole-authorship was meant to prevent: doubt and distrust of who actually completed the work. I could also withdraw the paper, but this would be worse than a replacement. It would suggest something is fundamentally wrong with the results rather than with the nominals attached to them. So I am currently stuck. In a month or so, there will be two versions of this paper floating online: one with my and Eugene’s name, and one with only my name. 

On some level this could appear duplicitous. If people search the article’s name online, they will inevitably find the arxiv preprint version. On the preprint server, the reader would note that the article has both my and Eugene’s name. Eugene’s name, the famous protein physicist he is, would add credibility to the work and thus make it more likely to be cited. But when people then seek out the formal journal publication of the work in order to cite it properly, it would then be listed only under my name. Here’s the train of thought in summary: Discovery of the work by title; Legitimation of the work through its association with one credible author; Attribution of work to one of the non-credible authors (i.e., me). On some level this is really how much scientific work is distributed when a single author is unknown. The author gains credibility by association if it is difficult to grant such credibility on the merits of the work itself. But this is often done at the level of acknowledgments, not at the level of contradictory levels of authorship. I imagine this contradiction would be a stigma on the paper making it less likely to be read or skimmed. 

If there is a lesson here, then I have not learned it because I cannot find it. No, this is dishonest. I can see many lessons. I should not have published the paper on arxiv before the journal review process. I should have made my thoughts about attribution clear to myself and to Eugene at the start. After realizing the attribution mistake I made I should have left the paper as is and focused on writing the second one as a sole-author. I think I could have seen and internalized these lessons ever before going through the experience which elicited them. But of course if that were true I would not have gone through the experience at all, side-stepping it, as it was, because I would realize the snake trap as a snake trap.

Statistical Physics of Finite Groups
So having developed a statistical physics of the symmetric group, I think a next natural step would be to develop a statistical physics of finite groups. The legend has it that all finite groups are isomorphic to the symmetric group, so depending on how deep this statement runs I may already be done. In such a statistical physics you would associate a single group element with the lowest energy and then other group elements would be associated with particular values of $j$. I know next to nothing about the symmetric group (despite having just written a published paper on the statistical physics of it), so in order to move forward in this direction I would need to do some studyin’. 

I would also need to find a way to develop a partition function when we only have access to some permutations in the symmetric group. I imagine this would primarily lead to a restriction on the symmetric polynomials we consider in the theory. 

This page has a good starting reference
https://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Symmetric-group.pdf 

Some terms I would need to define and know how to use:
symmetric group
isomorphic
Cayley’s theorem: see http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/369676/can-someone-explain-cayleys-theorem-step-by-step
group axioms
permutation group
automorphism group
homology
representation theory

High energy theory is filled with so many fads and fashions, so much arbitrarity of assumptions, so much dogmatism—in short, so much nonsense—that it doesn’t make much sense to me to work in the field if you’re going to spend all your time elaborating someone else’s pet theory.

If a subject is already received a great deal of attention, if it has a glamorous aura, if its practitioners are prize winner who receive large grants, stay away from that subject. Listen to the news coming from the current hubbub, learn how and why the subject became prominent, but in making your own long-term plans be aware it is already crowded with talented people. You would be a newcomer, a private amid bemedaled first sergeants and generals. Take a subject instead that interests you and looks promising, and where established experts are not yet conspicuously competing with one another, where few if any prizes and academy memberships have been given and where the annals of research are not yet layered with superfluous data and mathematical models. You may feel lonely and insecure in your first endeavors, but, all other things being equal, your best chance to make your mark and to experience the thrill of discovery will be there.
 — Edwin O. Wilson, Letters to a Young Scientist


Why do you do the work you do? It’s a question that I’ve long struggled to answer, and even though I’ve written a few essays on the subject, I’m not entirely sure I’ve answered the question as completely or as honestly as possible. Maybe this is because I am trying to hit a moving target, and the question formed in response to a long forgotten query can now be answered in a way which makes no contact with that initial query. The answer has changed and continues to do so, and thus this sense of a precisely and temporally-independent “why”, the only “why” my intuition would immediately accept as valid, does not exist. But this “why” can and does exist in the moment, and I’ve always believed it has an answer even if you do not know it. The knowing it, is thus a question of seeing what has always been there but seldom noticed. Your drives, desires, decisions have causes not merely extending from some fantasy of rationality. They extend from value systems interrogated only once you find it impossible to reconcile the reality, constantly kept at bay, with what you have always believed to be true. This disillusionment feels tragic when one is on its precipice. Thrust to the edge of an ever-descending blackness you look back at where you came and wonder if something of this former world could be salvaged, could be returned to. But you remember all paths seem to lead to this thing which exists before you the thing, you tried to push out of your mind but which found you nevertheless. So you step and you fall and your throat goes soar with your screaming and you fall and you fall. 

I like to believe, I am no longer falling, that I did eventually make it to the other side. And the truth in this belief exists in what I now I allow myself to see, the things which were always there but which were always pushed away. I see the truth about my sexuality, the truth about my limited intelligence and how that does not relinquish from me the responsibility of the attempt, the truth about my loneliness and my fears of loneliness, the truth about my weakness, the truth about my strength. But perhaps I am wrong, about all this. Perhaps the belief that I now see the truth is just an ever clearer indication that it still remains hidden from view. Because if there seems to be one constant truth about the human condition, it is paradoxically the fact that once man believes he has discovered one existential truth he is certain to have only discovered some aspect of his reflection. 

What does this have to do with E.O. Wilson’s advice? Well, for much of my work in physics, I was operating under the seduction of reputability. Recognizing an implicit hierarchy in the fame and approbation given to those in high energy physics, I became attracted to the field not necessarily because I was drawn to the knowledge it provided. Indeed the knowledge it engaged with was of a rather speculative and isolated variety, not having the solid logical purity of mathematics or the clear life-scale relevance of any of solid state physics or engineering. Rather, I was attracted to the promise particle physics held for answering a deeper why, the “why” of existence. Not the cosmological “why” of existence, but something much more local, much more selfish, the question which in more simple phrasing is “why do I matter?” Being in the field, the question was clear if never articulated. I matter because I am working within a subject which is historically the corollary of fields which have sufficiently inspired the popular imagination to be worthy of public interest and acclaim. It was the second quantum revolution and then quantum mechanics’ off shoots into nuclear, atomic, and molecular physics and of course the Manhattan project, which gave rise to the modern infrastructure of particle physics. And I felt, that in some vaguely theological way, I was making contact with something greater than I was only when I was specifically working in the historical tradition of the physical reductionism. 

There are too many physicists in high energy theory, and I imagine that many of them are there not merely because they are interested in the work. Conversely, physics being what it is, one could say it is impossible to do any sort of research without caring about your work, but my own history stands in contradiction to this claim. I would agree that work done without love is often done poorly, but the vagaries of persistence being what they are, it can still often be done. So, I may be projecting here, but part of the reason, I think, so many people run to the hot and sexy fields in a discipline is not because they are interested in the field but because they want to be hot and sexy too. It is status affiliation, a means of increasing your social positions, or your sense of your social position, by mingling with those you believe are of a higher status than you are. Now, these are not the reasons Wilson gives for avoiding popular fields of work. His reasons are more pragmatic and I think they are true. But I think they perhaps miss the point of why some people “do what they do.” In a way his commendation would be moot if he were speaking to he really believed he was speaking to. Someone who followed a subject-borne curiosity, rather than being driven by intellectual and existential insecurity, would study the subjects she wanted and pursue the questions she was interested in regardless of the field’s popularity. Wilson’s advice would not apply if this person spent most of her time working in subjects tangential to the community’s interest, and his advice would be ignored if she was working on something coincident with it. She would not care who else is working in the subject, because she would be working within it for reasons independent of priority or productivity. 

To be clear, this ideal person does not exist. Hers is the historically romantic image of a scientists, a paragon of objectivity and impartiality, and devoid of the uncomfortable imperfections which make humans so human and arguably make science even possible. There are parts of her in all of us, not merely scientists, but so too do we have parts of her antithesis. And I think, if her antithesis loomed larger in a person, Wilson’s advice would seem somewhat off-base if not contradictory. For if you entered science primarily because of how it made you feel about yourself, because science, to you, was one prolonged status-affiliation project, then of course you would want to work in the most popular fields because it would only be through such work that the value of your work would be most easily and universally acknowledged. Why else would you be doing science, if you were not working on something which was obviously known to be so valuable and interesting, if only superficially, to your society.

There are those who may say it was the modern military-industrial complex which developed this utilitarian and production based style of both scientific work and the interpretation of the value of that work. If you think, they say, physicists do their work for superficial and easily manipulated reasons then look to the society which suggests to them no deeper principle around which to organize a life. But I think this is too easy of an explanation. More honestly, it seems the modern infrastructure of war and production is not the cause of our superficiality but perhaps a concomitant of it. Military spending and infrastructure built up to protect a country where freedom is largely synonymous with commercialism and people’s sense of control of their lives could be won or lost based on the number of guns they have at home. Now, I know this is unfair and logically sloppy. But to the point, I know that the emptiness I felt, the one which drove me to try to fill it with prestige and awards, seems merely to be the microscopic search for identity that my country has been engaging with for its entire history.

From Coates’ Between the World and Me

If the streets shackled my right leg, the schools shackled my left. Fail to comprehend the streets and you gave up your body now. But fail to comprehend the schools and you gave up your body later. 
— pg 25

The fearless boys and girls who would knuckle up, call on cousins and crews, and, if it came to it, pull guns seemed to have mastered the streets. But their knowledge peaked at seventeen, when they ventured out of their parents’ homes and discovered that America had guns and cousins, too. 
— pg 27

Your grandmother was not teaching me how to behave in class. She was teaching me how to ruthlessly interrogate the subject that elicited the most sympathy and rationalizing—myself. Here was the lesson: I was not an innocent. My impulses were not filled with unfailing virtue. And feeling that I was as human as anyone, this must be true for other humans. If I was not innocent, then they were not innocent. Could this mix of motivation also affect the stories they tell? The cities they built? The country they claimed as given to them by God?

Amy Saving Me
I have been putting this off, believing that I will get to it when I had time, when I had space to fully think through all the relevant pieces. But the so called relevant pieces kept multiplying in number and the project grew and grew in scope until I had fallen into the common trap of dreaming about a project which was too grand for me even to begin. Where would I start? On December 19th when we first kissed? On January 4th when we first spent an intimate night together? On April 23 when our relationship ended? And then of course there is the fact that the relationship did not in fact end that Amy and I are now navigating something neither us has yet labeled and neither of us wishes to completely discuss. I feel, however, that we will discuss the nature of our relationship tonight and so I must ready myself for that discussion by resolving its premises and antecedents here. 

What has threatened, currently threatens, and will continue to threaten our relationship is sex. I would never have imagined this to be a potential breaking point months ago when I sat in New Orleans struggling to work and fight off thoughts of what Amy looked like naked. Back then I had believed myself to be on the precipice of something new and undiscovered in my life: Sexual intimacy. I could not stop thinking of her and I tried to regulate my own urges against their external manifestation which I knew would certainly drive her away. But alas it seemed I was not careful enough. One night a few days before I returned to Harvard, I suggested we watch a movie remotely through an online video sharing site. I would watch it in New Orleans and she would watch in in Cambridge. She said “Sure,” and we set a time for later that evening. An hour until the set time, she sent me an email asking if we could postpone for a few hours; she was making good progress with her thesis and didn’t want to stop. Could she call me when she finished to see if I was still up? Sure I said, trying my best to play the understanding friend, but I was disappointed. Surely her thesis was more important than keeping an appointment with me, but did she have to make it known so explicitly? Three hours later, when I was near sleep, she texted me asking if I was free to watch the film. Slightly peeved I told her I was already in bed and planning to go to sleep. “Let’s do it later,” I said, and she obliged. On the morning of the next day, I asked her if she was free to watch Twin Peaks later that night. Hours came and went and there was still no response. A day after I sent my first message, she still had not responded, so I decided to send another. Through Whatsapp, I asked her if she had seen my previous message. She responded soon after, asking me if I had seen her email. I had not. I opened gmail to find a message from her sent at 1:30 AM of that morning.

Hi Mobo,

I don't have the mental resources to calculate whether, based on my current rate of progress, potential variations in this rate, and the amount I have yet to accomplish, I have time tomorrow after 8:30 (just after the Daily Brain time!). Can I propose a date/time to you when I'm mentally fit? Also, as a rule of thumb, when one wants to get together, I feel it generally works well to bring it up once or twice, then just leave the ball in the other person's court. I mention this because usually when we spend time together, it's sometimes you, sometimes me, and sometimes chance who initiates. But in the past couple weeks, it's been mostly you. Trust that I also want to get together and can also initiate. I can tell you've been respecting my spacetime, though, by not texting a lot and by being flexible when I postponed yesterday, and I greatly appreciate it.

Warmly,
A

After the first sentence, I felt something tilt internally, a tremor indicating the previous ground upon which I stood was less firm than I had believed. Amy’s email had shocked me mostly because it had seemed to come out of nowhere. Days earlier we were jocularly texting one another and now she seemed to be capriciously asking for some space. What had happened? Did she finally lose interest in me like all other women had in the past? What should I do?

It was at this moment that I was ejected from my reverie and placed firmly back into a world where pain and betrayal and despair were possible. I realized that Amy was not different. In a flash she had switched from warm to cool, from relational to distant. So she too could hurt me and I would only ignore this fact at my own peril. And since that moment, I must say that although I do feel for Amy what I have felt for no one else, and although she has seldom gratuitously communicated a desire for distance, that initial re-establishment of apartness has colored all of my subsequent engagement with her. Later she explained that she had a difficult day prior to the night she sent the email, one where the stresses of her present and the stresses of her future collided into one. She had learned that some important aspect of her dissertation paperwork was missing, an element which would endanger her ability to graduate on time. After hearing her explanation I tried commiserate, tried to be understanding, but on some level which is arguably mature and human, I never fully trusted her again. Maybe this is inaccurate. Maybe it is better to say I realized that if I continued to live the dream that she was infallible and safe, I would rightly suffer the consequence. Or perhaps it is fairer to say that I left a fantasy and returned to reality, and the relationship appeared to become tinted because, of course, living on earth will always feel more pedestrian than living amongst the clouds. But man was not meant to live amongst the clouds, insubstantial as they are, and believing otherwise would inevitably lead to an Icarian fate. 

The day after, while I was flying back to Boston, she followed up and asked if we could watch the movie that evening. I, of course, said yes, elated at the opportunity to see and be around her in person. That night would become the first we spent together, the first time I was inside her. But, in a way, it was already too late. My idea of our relationship as something which would save me had been tempered. Maybe, I thought, Amy could not free me from all my insecurities and my perennial sense of difference and rejection by the world. Perhaps no one could. 

Except Amy did save me. She freed me from the notion that I was intellectually alone in the world, released me from the idea that all women were superficial, opportunistic feminists who would never pursue me with the intensity that I pursued them. Softened my hazy and non-specific hatred of all people and of the world we had created. Allowed me to imagine a life for myself which did not end with me hanging from a rope. She taught me there was indeed goodness, beauty, and kindness within my sphere of experience and she was both its embodiment and its promise. 

And I guess that is what this entire essay is about, the way Amy saved me from some things and taught me that I would need to save myself from others.

[//]

Forgiveness after Mistakes
But the email that night, and other experiences with Amy have often perplexed me. Often Amy has seemed to treat me in a way that I know she would not like to be treated, and it appears she has done so in full cognizance of the double-standard. In late May, the night she returned from a weekend trip to Martha’s Vineyard, I went to her home. During the day I had gone to the Arboretum with Elana where we had spent much of the day walking around the Arboretum grounds. So by the time that I returned to campus and then came to Amy’s house, my legs were exhausted. As I walked to Amy’s place, I recalled that in the past week I had traveled to her house five out of six times that we had met. This was on my mind when I stood on her doorstep, so after I entered her place and said hello, I asked her “Could we meet at my place more often?” Her face flashed with surprise. “Good to see you too,” she responded. And just like that, things were off to a bad start. I apologized, asking if we could start over. I brought my hands to her arms and then to her shoulders. “Hi Amy,” I said my eyes searching through hers, “It’s good to see you.” She looked down, “It’s good to see you to,” she said weakly, but still the night was changed. 

She told me about her stay in Martha’s Vineyard, discussing the fact that she couldn’t really appreciate it because of an assignment she had to complete for Monday. I listened silently feeling then the distance she would later cite for why we wouldn’t have sex. For reasons I could not explain to myself, I was vaguely annoyed to hear her complain about her weekend away. Perhaps it was because I believed where the night would lead and felt that this prelude was poor preparation for that direction. Having in a way registered the frequency at which she wanted to have sex, I imagined that this night after being gone for many nights she would want to do it. And although there was little fervor in my heart, I was psychologically prepared to do so. When we came to it, I stood behind her my palms on her abdomen my lips on her neck. She exhaled and I brought my hands full circle around her waist. Slipping my hands into the sides of her pajamas I pulled them down to her ankles. By now, it should have been clear where this was going, but we were in bed, her naked except for her panties me on top of her and on the precipice of penetration, before she told me to stop and wait “I want to finish the essay first,” she said. Who was this person? I said inwardly, but outwardly I nodded my head toward her desk and said “Go ahead.” She shifted and I climbed off of her, eventually spending the night watching Family Guy and falling asleep long before she came to bed. 

Here is what I believe about Amy. If the roles were flipped, if I were the one upset and crying because she didn’t want to have sex when I wanted to, then she would be cordial and kind in the moment, but over time she would be less attentive to my emails, less receptive to my offers for meetings, in short she would slowly shift away until it became clear that whatever connection we had was no longer there. 

A night later she would explain why we didn’t complete what we started. She would not mention the essay but would instead say she didn’t want to go through with it because “It didn’t feel right.” To her, we seemed to be dissonant that evening, and she didn’t want to be emotionally dishonest by consummating a connection which was not there. I would find this explanation fantastical. How many times had we been in bed together and my mere reluctance to have sex had driven her into a mix of fury, frustration, and dejection? The second time I spent at her house, a few days after that first glorious day in January, I kissed her and touched her without escalating it to something more, and after asking me many times “If I wanted her,” she became fed up with my answers and burst into tears; she was disturbed by the fact that I wasn’t as enthusiastic as she felt I should be, seemingly expecting me to rip her clothes off as soon as we were in bed together. 

Once she told me if we were not going to have sex on a night we were going to see each other, I should tell her beforehand so she could decide whether she wanted to see me. The night that we broke up was the night she returned to Cambridge after a week spent visiting her cousin. In the midst of a kiss which would lead to somewhere I was not prepared to go, I asked her if we could skip sex that night. She brought her hands together and up to her chest. “Why?” she asked. The truth was I, for whatever reason, just didn’t feel like doing it. Feeling that she would not accept this, for I had given similar reasons before, I told her something practical, that I had spent the past two nights masturbating and was too raw to perform. She apparently liked this even less. She let me know that I was being selfish, that I knew I would be seeing her today and that she would want to have sex. According to her, given that I knew she was coming, I should have “exerted some self control” and waited a few days rather doing what I did. This line of arguing disgusted me. In my head I was telling her “No,” to an act that people should enter freely and without coercion. What did it matter what my explanation was?

At that moment she seemed to express that hobgoblin of sentiments which make tyrants out of leaders and hypocrites out of the populace: entitlement. Apparently, she felt entitled to having sex with me because we were dating. Her avarice was astounding, precisely because I had never felt it and would likely never express it if I did. Months before, when it became clear that Amy and I would be together, I was ecstatic about the opportunity but held no delusions about the meaning. It was not “just sex” but neither did it mean that she was beholden to me afterwards. I was grateful for the time we spent together, and our nights of intimacy were the additional gifts to an already judicious bounty. They were the proverbial icing on an already rather large cake. But she did not seem to see our relationship this way, instead essentially believing that sex was tantamount to the relationship itself. 

Upon reflection, this is not completely honest, for although I have never felt “entitled to sex” with Amy—likely because she has always wanted it more than I did—I have felt close to this type of entitlement with Jiwon. To be sure Jiwon and I spent many hours together, hours that I ultimately deemed to be insufficient as a basis for our friendship given that she was unwilling to take things further. The problem was that I was so sexually attracted to Jiwon that the fact that I could not express that attraction physically was maddening. Being around her went from vaguely pleasant to tortuous simply because she did not allow me to touch her. Perhaps this is similar to the way Amy feels about me. Why don’t I feel such a sexual need with Amy? Maybe because what attaches me the most to Amy is the intellectual spaces we share, the way she saves me from the sense that I am philosophically alone in the world. The sex to me is not at all peripheral, but neither is it the point of our relationship. 

I say to myself that my relationship with Jiwon was different. Jiwon and I did not have the intellectual connection Amy and I share—a connection which I now value more than any sexual one—so of course I would try to connect with Jiwon sexually. But Amy and I relate to each other on so many other levels besides the physical one. Why aren’t these other connections enough? Likely these are not the right questions to ask, based as they are on the premises I bring into a relationship and not related to anything that Amy believes. It’s likely that for me the intellectual connection saves me from the loneliness for which sex is a superficial panacea, but for Amy the intellectual connection makes its expression through sex all the more desirable. 

We broke up that night she returned from visiting her cousin. Our sexual dissonance had become too much for our relationship to bear. On my part, the problem with Amy’s reactions to my sexual denials were both philosophical and practical: How could I truly say “Yes” to something when I felt that I was not allowed to say “No”? How could I happily and willingly be intimate with Amy when I did it only to stave off an outburst that I did not wish to deal with? 

These were the rhetorical questions I asked myself in the days after we broke up, but by the time we returned to our relationship I had decided these questions were moot. If I loved Amy and I honestly wished to be with her, I would have to contend with her apparently selfish premises about sex, because such premises were part of her reality and must be made a part of mine if I am to be made a part of hers. 

Or so I believed. The night when she said she would rather work on her essay than have sex made me realize that her beliefs about sex were not at all universal for our relationship but seemingly applied only to her. In short, she could say “No” for whatever reasons she could levy, but I could not ever say “No” without fear of reprisal. Recognizing this, in that instant I felt quite far from her, as though this philosophy could expand beyond the context of our relationship problems and eclipse our accepted modes of interaction. For what can be said about a standard of morality which allows one to demand an ethics from others that he does not demand from himself?

To make a statement about agency, perhaps the problem is not with Amy but is with me. Amy is who she is—and at 29 she is growing more and more into this identity—and I too need to be who I am. But Amy has saved me from some things I have tried not to articulate and so I love her in direct proportion to my desire to love life, and in a way all my allowances are an attempt to escape the cynicism which claimed life was not living and to instead enter a world of faith which tries to see that it is. So taking her reactions, contradictions, and habits as a constant, the question left to me is what I will do. To this point I have been trying my best to appease her, perhaps out of some reflexive desire to maintain what I value in our relationship, but it appears this is not enough. I need to make a decision, one born from introspection and measure, rather than fear and reflex. 

I have since talked to her about this episode and she has since apologized. And although, I have claimed to accept her apology, much like I would expect her to accept any one of mine, perhaps the truth of these interactions is that no one ever forgives anyone. Instead the reality manifest in the unexpected behavior becomes incorporated into the reality of the relationship. It changes the relationship, as all confrontations do, and some magic is lost, or some magic which was never there is at last realized to be absent. As a result, expectations are re-calibrated if not lowered. Or perhaps this isn’t right: Maybe you don’t claim to expect less of him or her, but you certainly expect something different which might as well be approximated as something less. 

From here, it is a potentially dangerous death spiral, an arms-race of low expectations. You renege on my promises and suddenly—regardless of your apologies, your claims to change, and my claimed acceptance of these claims—I feel like I can do the same to you. It is perhaps never stated outright, these things just build in the background and crop up at the edge of a decision, but soon you find yourself affecting a distance you never would have before, simply because something in you says this action is OK and acceptable given the table your partner has laid.

Close to the end

In the weeks leading up to the first (or was it the second?) time we broke up, I felt myself pulling away from her. Close to what I thought was the end—and I suppose this was why I believed it was the end—I started fantasizing about other women. I did this willfully, fully aware of what these waking dreams could do to the reality Amy and I shared. At night, when I closed my eyes, it would be the bodies of close and acquaintances friends which intermingled with mine, not Amy’s. Why? When I told Mina Amy and I were over, he took in my stately reaction to my newly single status and took in the sexual dissonance which ended our relationship, and wondered if I was really attracted to Amy. This was the correct question to ask but framed as it inevitably was in the background of our country’s superficial measures of attractiveness, the premises were likely not correct. It was indeed true. I was less attracted to Amy now than, if not other women, who she was (or seemed to be) at the start of our relationship. 

For me, our moments together, both the pedestrian and the intimate, had degenerated into exercises in damage control. Many nights I would find myself in the strange position of desiring to meet her, but fearing the emotional minefield I would likely be entering. Her reactions to my periodic reluctance to have sex came to symbolize, in my mind, some vestigial immaturity. What else would she do which would reveal to me her latent hypocrisy and selfishness? In what ways would I discover that, although she may be leagues better than most humans, she too is also human?

This was perhaps a question that I had to ask of myself, rather than of her. She represented the world and I was a denizen of it, and like the physical world she was governed by laws I could study and appreciate, but which could not change. 

I have tried my best to line up my life in an order which appears from the outside rational and planned, and I have always, implicitly, expected others to do the same. The fact that most people don’t seem to view their own lives so critically has made me distrusting of man in the abstract. In essence, I have become a misanthrope, but I redeem myself by believing that I am a self-reflective one. I know my misanthropy is an aversion created more by my biases than other people’s flaws. I am constantly disappointed in other people’s cowardice, casual hostility, and carelessness because I see these qualities in myself and am constantly trying to exorcise them. But this self-structuring of character is something I rarely achieve even based as it is on my own principles of living, principles which I would like to believe, but which I know are not, universal. How then could I expect people to discern let alone live by precepts of life more connected to my personal history than their own? 

I wanted to believe life and human life was faithful to my sense of organization. But life is not like this. Life, as I hope to teach my students this summer, is messy, and if we are to truly engage with and understand it, we must make an intimate appraisal of this messiness and not prematurely supplant the disorder we see with the order we wish were there. I myself have not fully learned this. Finding no sense-making haven within the community of my peers, at some point I ran away (or tried to run away) from the inconsistencies of life into the stately structures of mathematics and physics, into a world where the topologies of logic did not require pretzel-like configurations in order to justify conclusions about life. In physics and mathematics, the world was given a guise of coherence and organization, an order which was there and manifest so long as one was willing to relinquish the biases of experience that built the intuition which clouded sight, an intuition to which the world had no true fidelity. But of course this world of order—both the sciences and the symbolic logic which is their language—was cultivated by humans with all their frailties and contradictions. And my recent years of life have shown me that the lessons of acceptance and of relinquishing expectations more true of you than of the world need to be applied beyond the domains of science in which I first discovered them. 

For, again, life is messy. There are things you must accept about it and thus accept about the people within it which do not always make sense, which skirt inconsistency and outright contradiction. And if you cannot accept these things about life and if you cannot accept the people who embody life’s eclectic contradictions, then you are failing to accept reality. 

So your willingness to be in a relationship with someone exists in direct proportion to your acceptance of the reality they represent. And I guess I had never completely accepted Amy’s reality to even begin to be attached to it. So maybe the reason I took our break up in the last weeks of April so easily was that I had so struggled against Amy’s world that by then I felt trapped within it. Thus our break up was like a bill of freedom, an inhale after weeks spent under water. I spent many of the subsequent days masturbating and looking up the images online I forbade myself 

But I still desired her, still wanted to be with her. And most of all, I still wanted to talk to her. After the break-up, we found it difficult to manage the distance, to go back to what we were before that night in December. Out of habit or out of love, I still treated her like my girlfriend. And instead of being frustrated by a friendship without the proverbial “benefits”, I enjoyed being near her. Keeping good on a promise we made before the end, we went to a Nigerian restaurant in Roxbury. The optics of the night resembled that of a romantic date. I even think we touched hands. At the end of the night, I bought her an extra dish of moin-moin to take home and hugged her good night. But we didn’t go our separate ways. Instead we walked the streets of Somerville and Cambridge talking about our relationship. I can’t remember what we said, but I know we came too close to our former intimacy because a night later she texted me asking for distance. She needed to grieve and couldn’t effectively do so if the ghosts who haunted her were conjured again and again. 

Surprisingly, this frightened me. How much distance would she need and for how long would she need it? 

[//]



…because you are attached to a bias of how it should be. On the other side, aren’t these biases necessary? Isn’t it our idealism which drives our hope which itself allows us to face communities of people which would be intolerable otherwise? 


Fantasies of sex, fantasies of other people are of course colored by your previous experiences, and since having sex with Amy I have found that my fantasies now have a luster they once did not. When I see a woman I can imagine us in bed together with a menacing precision and clarity. The visions come unannounced while I’m walking through Harvard’s campus or riding the subway. I would see a girl, and the next moment we would be in bed, her lying below me and gasping for air and holding her breasts as if they contained her life. 

As our relationship progressed, I was becoming less and less attracted to Amy as compared to—not other women but—when our relationship began.

I demand much of myself. Demand an order 
I demand that others too line their lives up in such ordered configurations and it is likely my recognition that other people do not do so which has made me so reluctant/unable to spend time with them. But this self-imposed order is something I myself rarely achieve even though it is based on my own principles of living. Should I expect others to achieve it especially given that they cannot see my principles? 

——-


I walk through the roadways of Harvard ever more exposed than I was before. 


For the past few months I have been moving, sprinting almost, headlong into a future about which I have always dreamed and which I only now seem capable of realizing. But this constant motion has not left much time for the reflection which had made it all possible, the thoughts conjured and fostered in the dark which gave me the latent conviction in possibilities yet made manifest. In these months I began and ended a relationship, published my first paper, almost ruined my relationship with my advisor, went to a workshop, then went to a conference, and applied for (and received) a job to teach my first physics course.

XI. The Invisibility of Revolutions

The temptation to write history backward is both omnipresent and perennial. But scientists are more affected by the temptation to rewrite history, partly because the results of scientific research show no obvious dependence upon the historical context of the inquiry, and partly because, except during crisis and revolution, the scientist’s contemporary position seems so secure. 

[…]

“For example, all three of Dalton’s incompatible accounts of the development of his chemical atomism make it appear that he was interested from  an early date in just those chemical problems of combining proportions that he was later famous for having solved. Actually, those problems seem only to have occurred to him with their solutions, and then not until his own creative work was very nearly complete.”

“Or again, Newton wrote that Galileo had discovered that the constant force of gravity produces a motion proportional to the square of time. In fact, Galileo’s kinematic theorem does take that form when embedded in the matrix of Newton’s own dynamical concepts. But Galileo said nothing of the sort. His discussion of falling bodies rarely alludes to forces, much less so to a uniform gravitational force that causes bodies to fall. By crediting to Galileo the answer to a question that Galileo’s paradigms did not permit to be asked, Newton’s account hides the effect of a small but revolutionary reformulation in the questions that scientists asked about motion as well as in the answers they felt able to accept.”

It seems that Kuhn’s main thesis in this section is that scientific revolution are often rendered invisible because modern historians and scientists interpret the work done by previous scientists according to the current paradigm. That is, if the scientists of the past were working in a field vaguely related to that which defines modern science, modern scientists would have a tendency to believe that these past scientists were working towards the solution of the same sphere of problems which defines modern science. It is risky or inadequate to believe this because as paradigms change, not only do the answers to questions change, so do the collection and interpretation of questions that scientists think are important. Thus two scientists separated by many years and working within two distinct paradigms, are never really working on the same problems even if there realm of physical study is the same. 

With regard to 
“those problems seem only to have occurred to him with their solutions” 

I’ve experienced this myself. The fact that the exact statement of a problem is most clear once we have found its solution, suggests that the initial formulation of the problem is not what we conceive it to be. The typical picture is to see problems and solutions as diametric functors of knowledge. Rather we should see problems not as complete questions in of themselves but as a citation and depiction of holes in the narrative. The holes begin fuzzy and ill defined and as we go through the process of “solving” the problem, we are in essence filling in the hole, and only by completely occupying this previously empty space can we properly detail the contours which originally defined it. 

Problems and solutions are functions of each person’s individual knowledge space. Hence they are not real aspects of the world. In the physical world there are no problems per se, no paradoxes, no pieces of logical argument missing and incomplete. The physical world is complete in of itself. It is the human mind with its finite understanding which looks upon the world and sequesters it into problems and solutions, questions and answers. The constancy that humans make contact with when they are working on problems is like a narrative. To the human mind the narrative is incomplete, but the narrative is complete in the sense of a logical and ordered universe. The act of solving problems, is the act of filling in the incomplete human understood narrative so that it more closely resembles the true narrative (which we can never completely encompass) of the physical universe. 

XII. The Resolution of Revolutions

“Any new interpretations of nature, whether a discovery or a theory, emerges first in the mind of one or a few individuals. It is they who first learn to see science and the world differently, and their ability to make the transition is facilitated by two circumstances that are not common to most other members of the profession. Invariably their attention has been intensely concentrated upon the crisis-provoking problems; usually, in addition, they are men so young or so new to the crisis-ridden field that practice has committed them less deeply than most of their contemporaries to the world view and rules determined by the old paradigm.”

Was it Kuhn who popularized the notion that the originators of a new paradigm are typically young? Is it not strange that to a certain extent in scientific development experience is not as unilaterally reliable as you would expect it to be in an area of human knowledge dominated by such vast quantities of information? Perhaps we can understand the reason for this better by asking what resources experience typically affords a researcher and try to understand why these resources are not especially necessary in the formation of a new paradigm. 

Primarily, I think experience provides a researcher with a large spectrum of personally worked through examples within an existing paradigm. This experience in turn makes the researcher better able to solve problems within the paradigm. But as the scientist is accumulating this experience he is ever slowly becoming more and more entrenched in seeing the world through the current accepted physical framework. But this physical framework, as are all such theories, is inevitably limited and cannot adequately describe/explain all aspects of the world. Consequently, the resolution of a physical problem that the framework cannot solve would be immune to the force of experience. Indeed experience would directly be a detriment as, through experience, the researcher would have been inculcated in the belief that with effort he can solve this problem that his paradigm cannot in reality be stretched to encompass. Instead what is needed is someone whose view of the world is not so committed to an existing paradigm that he is incapable of adopting a potentially better, yet incompatible different one. This usually can only occur with someone who is new to the field where the problem receives definition. 

Experts have been seen to solve problems in their fields more effectively than novices because a well-structured, easily activated knowledge base allows for efficient search of a solution space and possibly for automatic access to promising solution paths. But what happens when a problem requires a broad search for a solution outside the usual scope of the domain? One possibility is that subjects with expertise in the domain might actually be at a disadvantage, because their knowledge may confine them to an area of the search space in which the solution does not reside.
[…]
The poorer performance of high-knowledge subjects on the misleading problems is consistent with the hypothesis that domain knowledge can act as a mental set. It appears that domain knowledge not only biases a first solution attempt but also fixates the high-knowledge subject by defining and narrowing the search space, preventing a broad search, and decreasing the chances of finding an appropriate solution….
As a result, the subjects at lower levels of knowledge (but not no-knowledge) were more flexible in their problem solving, reaching correct solutions more often than their most knowledgeable subjects. The specific conditions that this effect was observed under were (1) on a creative problem-solving task, where creative is defined as requiring productive (as opposed to reproductive) thinking, and (2) on a task that was of a level of complexity such that novices could engage in problem solving to the same extent as experts. 
— From [2]

The way experience can be detrimental in developing a solution to a problem can be illustrated with a toy example from [1]. Let’s say a man and his son get in a car accident. The man dies. The son is badly injured and taken to a hospital, where the surgeon who is to operate on him exclaims “This is my son!”. Now, the pivotal question is: Who is the surgeon? If you did not answer this question immediately it is likely because experience has taught you to associate “surgeons” with “male” so you believed the story was paradoxical. Conversely, someone who perhaps grew up in a family where there was a woman surgeon would not be so limited by the traditional perspective and would see the solution more clearly.

“To the historian, at least, it makes little sense to suggest that verification is establishing agreement of fact with theory. All historically significant theories have agreed with the facts, but only more or less. There is no more precise answer to the question whether or how well an individual theory fits the facts. 
[…]
[But] It makes a great deal of sense to ask which of two actual competing theories fits the facts better. Though neither Priestley’s nor Lavoisier’s theory, for example agreed precisely with observations, few contemporaries hesitated more than a decade in concluding that Lavoisier’s theory provided the better fir of the two.”

Here Kuhn is contesting the seemingly overused truism that scientific theories (in physics, specifically) are accepted according to how well their theoretical predictions match reality. His main point is that all scientific theories in the past have matched reality to some extent, and so it is inaccurate to say that theories are verified and then accepted. 

Instead, Kuhn states that when scientists adopt a new theory they are in essence making a value judgement. Both the old and the new theory accurately predict reality to some extent and both also fail to make adequate predictions. But in transitioning to the new theory, scientists are deciding that in spite of its incompleteness, it is better than the old theory. 

—————
“The proponents of competing paradigms are always at least slightly at cross-purposes. Neither side will grant all the non-empirical assumptions that the other side needs in order to make its case. Like Proust and Berthollet arguing about the composition of chemical compounds, they are bound partly to talk through each other.”

So any physical theory needs some non-empirical assumptions as its foundation. Interestingly, when you have competing paradigms I imagine that the assumptions in one, exist as results in the other and thus it is difficult for scientists on either side of the dividing line to agree about the results their respective paradigms obtain for the same question. 

——

“In the first place, the proponents of competing paradigms will often disagree about the list of problems that any candidate for paradigm must resolve. Their standards or their definitions of science are not the same. Must a theory of motion explain the cause of the attractive forces between particles of matter or may it simply note the existence of such forces?”

The example Kuhn gives after this quote is Newton versus Aristotle/Descartes in theories of gravity. Apparently, Newton’s theory of gravity was initially rejected because it merely postulated (and didn’t explain the existence of) a force of attraction between particles, while Aristotle’s and Descartes’s theories provided an explanation of the cause of the force. Kuhn deftly states that the adoption of the Newtonian paradigm removed a question from science until the development of general relativity. Different paradigms answer different questions, and when we adopt one in lieu of another we are effectively (albeit implicitly) deciding which questions we most value the answer to. 

——— 

“Since new paradigms are born from old ones, they ordinarily incorporate much of the vocabulary and apparatus, both conceptual and manipulative, that the traditional paradigm had previously employed. But they seldom employ these borrowed elements in quite the traditional way.”

This is related to something I’ve experienced it each time I learned a new subject in physics. Constantly attempting to integrate my knowledge, I always tried to interpret a new subject I was learning in terms of something I learned before. But this interpretation was often made too literally, and I would end up trying to answer questions grounded in an old paradigm with the tools of a new one. Thus when learning quantum mechanics I was initially confounded by the lack of an x(t) function (no matter how indeterminate) for a particle, and when learning quantum field theory I searched textbooks for ways to calculate the energy spectrum of bound particles, and when I recently started learning things about string theory and extra dimensions I felt disconnected from the subject because it didn’t calculate things like scattering amplitudes, decay rates, or quantum corrections to mass.

The ultimate lesson from being stymied so many times is that there are different subjects in physics because we need different frameworks to answer different questions. We have electromagnetism as distinct from classical mechanics because electromagnetism, and not classical mechanics, is the formalism which allows us to answer questions about how electric and magnetic fields are created from charge and current distributions. In general the key to appreciating a new field in physics is in understanding which questions the field helps us answer which were unanswerable without it. 

————

In a sense that I am unable to explicate further, the proponents of competing paradigms practice their trades in different worlds. 
[…]
Practicing in different worlds, the two groups of scientists see different things when they look from the same point in the same direction. 
[…]
That is why a law that cannot even be demonstrated to one group of scientists may occasionally seem intuitively obvious to another. 

The different worlds these two groups of scientist occupy, differ not only in the foundational assumptions and terminology each employ, but also in the epistemic motivations of their work. Quite simply, the type of knowledge each seeks is different. These two scientists are seemingly operating in different worlds because, the paradigms which form their perspective of what they observe, constrains them to see and study nature in distinct directions. 

The last sentence is most striking to me because it is something which is macroscopically true at the level of competing paradigms but is also true within a paradigm where there are simply competing framings of a problem. Macroscopically speaking, my two examples come from literature. Babel-17 and “Story of Your Life” both feature examples where the protagonists were only able to solve a problem after they translated it into a language in which the solution was transparent. In Babel-17 (Part 2, Chapter 1) Rydra solves a problem by recognizing that great circles on a sphere intersect only after she expresses the problem in a language where the the word for great circle is OX (great circles intersect). In “Story of Your Life” the protagonists interacts with an alien race form whom Fermat’s least time principle is obvious and easier than trigonometry because their language is based on a similar minimization/global structure principle. 

On a microscopic level, I’m thinking of Feynman’s version of QFT and the standard version which extended from Quantum Mechanics. Because Feynman’s and Schwinger’ versions were manifestly relativistically covariant they could make use of symmetries to simplify physical results which were a pain in the ass to calculate with quantum mechanics. Moreover Feynman’s diagrammatic language simplified greatly the computation of particle interaction processes. Both, the covariant formulation of the theory and the diagrams which simplified calculations, serve as examples of language which made complicated results intuitively obvious. 

=> The key here is beginning with the appropriate foundations. It’s the foundation of the theory which determines how it will ultimately solve problems.

Louis’s advice
I just spoke to Louis Deslauries outside LISE cafe. I was his TF almost two years ago, but each time we meet he always has useful advice/comments for me. Months ago he suggested I use my opportunities in grad school to build proficiency in an experimental direction. Today, after I told him I was teaching at MIT for the summer, he told me the three teaching qualities which contribute to high student evaluations, at least in Harvard’s physics courses. 
One, the teacher should be a good lecturer. 
Two, the course should be well organized. 
Three, the teacher should demonstrate he/she cares about the students education. 

This is an interesting trifecta partly because it is predicated on the student’s perception of the teacher and partly because it seems rather comprehensive. With regard to the first point, it’s possible to wonder whether a teacher could be effective and fail to be perceived as such to his/her students? I wonder about this because often students after many years in their education have a sense of what a good teacher does and what a bad teacher does, but this sense of quality itself is contingent on the standard structure of teaching in which students remain mostly passive actors. Surely there could be a situation where a teacher requires more involvement and engagement from his students and his students recognizing a novel/non-standard method of education, believe he is a bad teacher. This is mostly a self-serving explanation. More than once I’ve found myself at the front of a classroom conveying to students something I felt was of deep importance and getting blank stares in return. Lectures on how to structure homework assignments or why problem solving education is actually incomplete was something I had always wished my past instructors conveyed, but few of my students seemed to care about these issues. Would I be declared a bad teacher, if I incorporated such extra-curriculum into a course?

This criticism somewhat dovetails with the second point. This metric seems rather comprehensive but given that it emerges from a suboptimal method of education, isn’t it possible that attempts to optimize teaching by this metric would lead to just a perfection of an incorrect teaching philosophy. For example, why really should a professor be a good lecturer if lecturing is not the best way to teach students new material?

What really am I criticizing here? The ability of students to evaluate instructors? The metric by which these evaluations are made? The entire profession of teaching?

Notes from NYT “Is an Open Marriage a Happier Marriage?”

What is Marriage?
If we decide that marriage is not only about raising biological offspring, that marriage is not about exclusive sexual intimacy, then what is marriage? A lifelong partnership? Now, that we have so expanded the definition of marriage, what does its declaration, title, and legal accoutrements afford two people that simply living together does not?

Tired of Your Partner’s traits?
— Daniel is a processor, a philosopher, a talker; Joseph is, as Elizabeth often says, “a simple guy.”
It seems that Elizabeth became tired of the traits of her partner and started looking for someone with different (even opposite) traits.  I’m probably projecting here. Except for the “talker” label, I would say I’m more like Daniel: a processor, someone who is not so simple. I can imagine someone I’m with getting tired of all this analysis and wishing to be with someone less beleaguered by thoughts and personal confusion. Then again, maybe it is the contrast between Joseph and Daniel which allows Elizabeth to appreciate the traits of either. 

Theory vs. Practice
—  “You get distracted by your other relationship — emails, texts, etc. — and that can pull you from our moments. There is a third person in our relationship who is pervasively there and not there. The theory of nonmonogamy is easier than the practice.”

This is probably my main view. In the idealized vision of human relationships in which people can maturely recognize that their partner’s feeling for them are not diluted by that partner’s feelings for other people, then yes nonmonogamy can be OK. You would need the additional requirement that people feel little need to balance the nonmonogamy, that is, there are no tit-for-tat extra-marital liaisons. Moreover, you would need to be OK with your partner spending time with their side-partner over you on some nights. 

Hypothetical situation: It’s Friday night after a long week of work. You’re at home watching Netflix by yourself.  Your partner had a stressful weak and wanted to relax with his/her side-partner, so currently he/she is on a date (which will likely end in sex) with that side-partner. How do you feel about this?

Perhaps this isn’t even the right question to ask. There are many things in a monogamous relationship one partner could feel annoyed or hurt by, but they live with it. The better question here is are you ok with this? Could you abide by this situation as a fundamental aspect of your relationship? Do the emotional costs outweigh the benefits, not only for the more active partner, but for the relationship as a whole. 

Tit-for-Tat
— Susan did not feel it detracted from the strength of their relationship when she started seeing someone who is, like her, an immigrant from Kenya. But when that faded and her live-in boyfriend started dating someone, she found that jealousy hijacked the relationship. At the peak of one fury, she grabbed his phone and sent the girlfriend a text: “Get your own boyfriend.”

I strangely get the sense that men are more tolerant of their wives extra-marital relationships than women are tolerant of their husband’s analogous relationships. Men’s proverbial jealousy doesn’t seem to feature too heavily in this article. Moreover, when there is an imbalance in the side-partnerships, men seem to be more OK with their partners having more side-partners than they do, but women don’t seem to do well in the reverse situation.

It doesn’t help that the main example in the text consists of a man who asked his wife to open the relationship, was rebuffed, and then was later asked by that same wife to open the relationship after she found someone herself. 

Then again, this could be a slanted reporting of cases. 

Men versus Women
— But of the 25 couples I encountered, a majority of the relationships were opened at the initiation of the women; only in six cases had it been the men.

Surely this can’t be a coincidence. Why is it that most of these couples were opened at the initiation of women? Maybe the only couples which survive for a measurable time period were those which were opened by women? Maybe this has to do with the writers selection process which could be influenced by the type of women/couples she has contact with? Maybe extra-marital secret liaisons are still more common with men but their honest counterparts are more common with women? 

False?
— One 2002 study found that men and women in committed relationships shared equal desire at the onset of their relationships, although for women, that desire dropped precipitously between one and four years into the relationship; for men, the desire remained high throughout that period. 

I don’t talk about sex with many guys, but of the guys I have spoken to (Mina, Peter, guy from Rethinking Conference) this does not seem to be true. These guys absolutely express a loss of interest in their partners within a few weeks or a year of starting dating. 

Marriage = Security?
—  Instead of resenting David for his distractions, demanding more focused attention from him, she seemed content to embrace the marriage for the security it did provide. 

Perhaps this is the definition I was looking for: Marriage provides a sense of security. Maybe it is like traveling around the world, seeing new places and meeting new people, while knowing you have a family and a home at one specific place in the world. Many times people say such trips make them even more appreciative of their home, and although they like the safety a home life provides, they also want to experience the thrill of being in a place they have never before seen. 

Logically, this seems fine enough, but I’m still not completely convinced. The problem with these analogies is that they always seem somewhat off, like some fundamental aspect of sexual relationships is not accounted for by the comparison. 

Knowledge of the self and of the partner
— The insistent need for security stifles couples’ sexual excitement, Stephen Mitchell argued, but it also builds the relationship on false premises — the deluded idea that your partner is knowable and entirely safe.

This is something which confused me in this article. I mean, really? A sense of security makes people falsely believe they completely know their partner? I believe it’s indeed possible to have a sense of security in one’s relationship and still not fully entertain the falsehood that one completely knows one’s partner. Or maybe Mitchell is suggesting something deeper here. Maybe the sense and achievement of security is inevitably paired with a safety which suggests total knowledge. Maybe the only reason someone can feel secure is to believe, sometimes falsely, that things which are important to them are not in danger.

Latent Homoeroticism
— Many people I talked with said they were surprised that opening the marriage changed the nature of their sexuality, that something was unleashed: They developed a new interest in a certain kind of role play, or acted on a long-suppressed desire to sleep with someone of the same sex. 

The author doesn’t expand on this “acted on a long-suppressed desire to sleep with someone of the same sex,” but it dovetails with what Amy and I discussed yesterday, but in reverse. Instead of same-sex marriage leading to more flexible definitions of marriage of which non-monogamy is one, non-monogamy lead to people having more flexible perceptions of their sexual identity. It would be interesting to hear male case stories of this given the societal conception of male-same-sex desire being simply unacknowledged full-blown homosexuality.

Wandering Eye
— And I was instinctively acting out a familiar, but also ridiculous, paradigm of marriage, one in which we collude in the fiction that no one of the opposite sex ever draws our interest.
Over the past months that I’ve been in a relationship with Amy, I’ve tried really hard not to stare at or make eye-contact with people I thought were attractive. As I perhaps should have known, such self-restraints just made the desire stronger. Being in one relationship does not imply that you are no longer attracted to someone else. But of course being attracted to someone does not mean you should act on that attraction. We all have constraints in our lives of which a monogamous relationship is only one. Still, the nature of forbidden fruit is ever alluring. Amy and I have had the open relationship conversation before, and we will likely have it again. In the past I hinted at the fact that we would probably no longer sleep together if she started sleeping with other people, but maybe this hard-line will simply make the prospect more enticing. Perhaps it would be better to say “I’m not going to tell you that sleeping with someone else will ruin our relationship. We’ll probably have to talk about it afterwards, but I won’t abandon you because of it.” 

Alternatively this is duplicitous. If I know full well that I will likely not want to be with Amy if she is sleeping with someone else, shouldn’t I saw so?

Then again is this even true? If she had slept with one of her ex-boyfriends or even someone I didn’t know when we were broken up, would I still no longer want to sleep with her? How explicit does our relationship need to be before I am (and have the right to be) hurt by her sleeping with other people?

“What are you up to?”
— Their own sex improved. And then, this April, one year after they opened their marriage, Rich asked for a divorce….The year had had its thrills, but Rich also felt perennially on guard, unnerved by the sense that there would always be more bruises to come. He had never really recovered from Jamie’s affairs, and he hated wondering, when he was home alone, what Jamie was doing with someone he had never met. 

This I think is the important question. Could you handle the ambiguity of now knowing whether your partner is having intimate experiences with someone else while you are not there? I often think about Amy when we are not together, and in the background of all this thought is the implicit assumption that although she may not always be thinking of me, at least she is not sharing the intimacy we share with someone else. How would these thoughts be colored by the possibility and the recognition that she is sleeping with someone at the very moment I am wishing to be with her? Working on a paper, visiting family, sleeping I can all abide by, but having sex with someone else? Why does that seem so much more difficult to tolerate. 

Who She is
— She had offered to stop seeing other people, but he said he did not want her to feel resentful. “This is 
not the life for me, and just as important, I don’t want to stop her from being who she is.”

I have often wondered the same thing about Amy. If she wants an open relationship and I do not want one, should we end the relationship so she could more fully become herself with someone else? The obvious answer is a contingent one: It depends on whether she values the openness of non-monogamy more than she values being with you. In the above quote it seemed like the woman was willing to opt-out of non-monogamy in order to preserve the relationship, but then the man, seemingly deciding for her, said no because he didn’t want to “stop her from being who she is.” In a sense he made the decision as to what was most important to her? Can he do this? Can I do this? 

I think about myself in this situation, and I easily see myself doing what the man did, but the motivations are muddled. It would be partly born out of insecurity and using this as an excuse to leave a relationship I don’t think I’m good enough for. It would also partly be born out of misanthropy and a desire to end a contact with and the burden of being with a complex human being. Only part (although a very real part) of it would be out of a desire to see Amy realize her full sexual potential. 



— NYT Comment: One partner was always more into the openness than the other. Pursuing one's own desires at the expense of growing as a couple, can lead to focusing too much on "I" and not enough on "we". Chronic self-absorption and an adolescent desire for continual new experiences, and "new energy", sap energy from the primary relationship in my opinion.

Is there something about intimacy which makes it seem more special when one believes it is an exclusive intimacy? Not exclusive as in the other person and you have never felt something like this before, but exclusive in a more locally temporal sense, in the sense that at this moment in each of your lives you two are the only people with whom you share this particular bond. And why is only the intensity and depth of sexual intimacy measured by this standard of exclusivity? No one begrudges their close friends for the few acquaintances the friend hangs out with instead of them? What is it about sex which makes it seem especially important in this regard?

My guess: People have an emotional attachment to the act of sex which places it in a narrative of fidelity and love, a narrative which seems to fracture and become corrupted if the people whose lives it connects no longer believe their connection is existentially unique. You could reasonably argue that this emotional attachment originally grew from cultural and religious contexts which had their own set of objectives, non of which placed individual human happiness or satisfaction as high priorities. And it you take it as true that the axes of emotional attachment are so varied and mutually independent that your life partner need not (and arguably cannot) be your partner of sexual desire, then you must take it as a corollary that monogamy is not only not required but perhaps maladaptive. 

I can’t say I agree with this conclusion. I also can’t say my disagreement is completely rational. Sure I could levy some claims and arguments supporting this disagreement, but I could not disentangle the various weights I place on contradicting evidence and the assumptions I allow from the emotional attachment I have to the conclusion. At bottom I cannot even imagine what it would feel like to know that Amy is being with other men on the nights when we are not together. I imagine her in bed on her back, eyes closed and mouth opened in ecstasy as some anonymous male figure marauds over her. And in this fantasy, it is never just her and the man. I cannot help but feel perennially present. She is either breaking the fourth wall and looking away from the man at me, the observer, or the anonymous man melts away and becomes a facsimile of myself, so that regardless of what is happening in the image, Amy and I remained connected as we always had. Now, one could read this as my subconscious acceptance of non-monogamy: I know what Amy and I have is sacred and inviolable and no matter her other relationships, past and current, we will always have what we have. But I do not see it this way. Instead I see my inability to imagine Amy with anyone else as a blindness, an unacknowledged and unarticulated assumption that I “have” her and no one else ever can, that she is committed to me and cannot be so committed to another. 

Moreover, I say, wouldn’t allowing additional sexual attachments dilute a relationship? I mean my attachment to people is already so insubstantial, so fraught with a fundamental distrust that any further dilution would probably render them nonexistent. But then again maybe a relationship which is so deeply concentrated on one person is not really healthy anyway? The “don’t put all your eggs into one basket” adage applied to romance. But as its opposite there too is the lesson of the boy and the cookie jar.

Between the World and Me

“Some days I would take the train into Manhattan. There was so much money everywhere, money flowing out of bistros and cafés, money pushing the people, at incredible speeds, up the wide avenues, money drawing intergalactic traffic through Times Square, money in the limestones and brownstones, money out on West Broadway where white people spilled out of wine bars with sloshing glasses and without police. I would see these people at the club, drunken, laughing, challenging breakdances to battles. They would be destroyed and humiliated in these battles. But afterward they would give dap, laugh, order more beers. They were utterly fearless. I did not understand it until I looked out on the street. That was where I saw white parents pushing double-wide strollers down gentrifying Harlem boulevards in T-shirts and jogging shorts. Or I saw them lost in conversation with each other, mother and father, while their sons commanded entire sidewalks with their tricycles. The galaxy belonged to them, and as terror was communicated to our children, I saw master communicated to theirs.” pg 88

The words “utterly fearless” jump out at me. Where, pray tell, does the notion come from? That the world is a safe and implicitly forgiving and nurturing place? Surely some people have it and some people do not. I notice it in the different ways Amy and I simply walk through the streets of Cambridge the different ways we engage with strangers. Amy j-walks across roads with oncoming traffic, confident in the  with the knowledge that approaching cars will stop for her. Often I have heard her smile and speak softly to people neither of us know. There is a freedom with which she navigates the world that I could never fully emulate. I walk through the world tense and vaguely fearful, and so I dislike my time spent in public gatherings. Guarded and wary, I move like a pugilist who keeps one foot in the ring cognizant that a hook can come from any direction. The casual hostility proffered and distributed without thought on the part of the deliverer can ruin a day, remind one of his/her difference, of one’s fundamental and inescapable impropriety even in the absence of anything done. I wonder what this strait-jacket does to the imagination, to ones sense of possibility, to ones ability to hope and to love the world. 

“In those days I would come out of the house, turn onto Flatbush Avenue, and my face would tighten like a Mexican wrestler’s mask, my eyes would dart from corner to corner, my arms loose, limber, and ready. This need to be always on guard was an unmeasured expenditure of energy, the slow siphoning of the essence. It contributed to the fast breakdown of our bodies. So I feared not just the violence of this world but the rules designed to protect you from it, the rules that would have you contort your body to address the block, and contort again to be taken seriously by colleagues, and contort again so as not to give the police a reason. 

[paragraph break mine] All my life I’d heard people tell their black boys and black girls to “be twice as good,” which is to say “accept half as much.” These words would be spoken with a veneer of religious nobility, as though they evidenced some unspoken quality, some undetected courage, when in fact all the evidenced was the gun to our head and the hand in our pocket. This is how we lose our softness. This is how they steal our right to smile. No one told those little white children, with their tricycles, to be twice as good. I imagined their parents telling them to take twice as much. It seemed to me that our own rules redoubled plunder. It struck me that perhaps the defining feature of being drafted into the black race was the inescapable robbery of time, because the moments we spent readying the mask, or readying ourselves to accept half as much, could not be recovered. The robbery of time is not measured in lifespans but in moments. It is the last bottle of wine that you have just uncorked but do not have time to drink. It is the kiss that you do not have time to share, before she walks out of your life. It is the raft of second chances for them, and twenty-three-hour days for us.” pg. 90


May 24, 2017 — Wednesday 7:53 PM
Let me begin by painting a portrait of the pioneering scientists we’ve encountered in our sessions. I hope that you’ll agree with me at the outset that there are different types of scientist: pioneers and explorers, developmental types, confirmers, axiomatists, technicians—classicists and romantics, Athenians and Manchestrians, Apollonians and Dionysians—call them what you will. Certainly van’t Hoff, cutting his rough block and leaving it for others to polish, is a different sort from Wilder Bancroft, one of Ostwald’s American students, who wrote, “There is nothing I delight in more than a problem in which ninety percent of the work has already been done”; and both of these men differ again from Planck, a codifier whose goal was the complete mathematization and axiomatization of the second law of thermodynamics. As Ariana says, we need all these types and more if science is to progress. So point one: A single mode of science education, of organization, of hiring and funding, will not generate and sustain the diversity of scientific types we need. The question I want to focus on in particular, however, is how to poster the pioneers and mavericks. - pg 383


My question is why the focus on pioneers and mavericks? If it is true that all of these types of scientists are necessary to science shouldn’t education attempt to cultivate all these directions of scientific ability? It seems to me Bernstein’s focus on the pioneers of science follows in a long tradition of historians of science focusing on the great men of science supposedly because these men are the most important contributors to the development of science itself. Or perhaps it is laziness? With so many scientists doing their work in a scientific community, a cursory glance would surely pick out the most ostentatious (by whatever standard) of them. Or maybe it is for efficiency? Clearly if much of the work in a field stemmed from a few dozen foundational studies, these foundational studies would be the more important branches relative to their subsidiary limbs. 

I am partly being ungenerous. I know what Bernstein means here: All the scientific types \textit{besides} the pioneers and mavericks are well catered to in scientific education. The education which teaches students the techniques and procedures needed to answering clearly posed questions often fails to teach them how to pose such questions for themselves. 

I am trying to partly rectify this in the course I’m teaching this summer. I’m starting each lesson with a scenario which leads to a question. Attempting to answer the question then forms the crux of the material developed in each lesson. I think this is a less ad-hoc way of presenting material. Also, I’m incorporating assignments where students are given a physical situation and are then required to ask questions about it. We will see how both of these go. 

[]

Assuming that potential mavericks can be identified and encouraged, what should we do with them? Historically, virtually every successful explorer had an early opportunity to do independent research. \textbf{By “independent” I emphatically do not mean the sort of advisor-directed “independent” research that doctoral students and postdocs do these days, in which the problem, the techniques, and the evaluation are the advisor’s. I mean that the young researcher identifies the problem, learns or invents the techniques for carrying out the research, and evaluates the results.} By “early”, I mean either by the age of twenty-two (preferably considerably earlier) or, if the researcher entered science late, within a year of beginning doctoral studies. In the case of our explorers, the early opportunity for independent research occurs by the age of twenty and is followed by institutional freedom of some sort immediately after graduate school.  

Examples are legion: Darwin, Maxwell, Joule, Planck, the Ionists, Einstein, J.J. Thomson, E. O. Lawrence, most members of the Manhattan project, Dobzhansky, J. B. S. Haldane, H. J. Muller, James Watson. pg. 385

I very much agree with this. In fact this perhaps can be seen as the foundational problem I see in science education: students are not given the opportunity to develop and pursue their own projects. Jesse (who recently received tenure at MIT) once explained why this was. Graduate school was an apprenticeship in which the graduate student learned from the advisor by working on projects that the advisor assigned and which he knew were soluble and important. When students are undergraduates they do this in microcosm by working on parts of already established projects. Whether this continues when graduate students become post-docs seems to depend on the field they enter, with high-energy theory having independent post-docs and high-energy experiment being almost entirely principal investigator driven. 

The possible utility of having an early exposure to independent research work is that it develops a habit of thinking which is derived from personal interest rather than institutional or communal direction. Having one’s early research projects defined by and advisor could lead to the expectation (as I think it did in Jesse’s case) that the only way research is done is by physicists agreeing on a set collection of problems which they then divvy up for solution. Such an approach to work makes the work itself impersonal, something more akin to an assignment given by a superior rather than a curiosity driven investigation. 

How much better would student’s experiences in graduate school be if they had previously learned how to define and explore projects themselves? How many students would have escaped the long deathly slog through dissonant-after-dissonant project born from someone else’s curiosities and interests?

“In terms of Jenny’s model of science, you codify your way of seeing the universe as a young scientist and then the pattern traps you. But does aging necessarily lead to mental ossification?

[. . . ]

A significant number of scientists make important discoveries or inventions well into their fifties and sixties. Berthollet, Pasteur, Fleming, Planck . . . - - - all made major contributions to science after forty. 

Now, what do these men have in common? In every case that I have been able to examine, researchers who continued to be productive past middle age changed fields regularly. In effect, they periodically returned to the state of a novice by taking up a new subject. They broke out of the patterns of work and thought to which they had become accustomed. As Benzer remarked, ‘The best way to have fun in science is to do something you are not trained for.’ ”
pg. 386

I like this conception of science successfully done as science which is born from interest rather than professionalism. But people do need to work

But the academic system I currently occupy is one which cannot be divorced from the larger careerist system of the non-academic world. How could one learn to have faith in one’s own interest when it is clear (or apparently clear) that you will not necessarily be rewarded monetarily or vocationally for those interests? Perhaps it reduces to a question of why you do what you do. People indeed need to make money, but if you sell your work to others and thus allow it to be directed by someone other than the one for whom it has the greatest importance, is it all a surprise that said work loses something?

This is too far no doubt. I’m talking about vague mysticism, while Bernstein is discussing something rather practical. Fidelity to interests rather than accumulated accolades is more beneficial to continued scientific productivity. 

[]

“Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar is typical. He started his research career studying black holes in 1933; took up the problem of the distribution of stars in 1937; studied why the sky is blue during the forties; the behavior of hot fluids in magnetic fields in the fifties; the stability of rotating objects in the sixties; the general theory of relativity in the seventies; and black holes again in the eighties. Says one observer: ‘Just talking about ‘Chandra’s style’ makes other astronomers tired. They can’t understand how he regularly forces himself to abandon a subject and start over—how, in a discipline where a forty-year old theoretician is considered way past his peak, a man of sixty-three could profitably \textit{begin} analyzing what happens when things disappear down a black hole.” pg. 387

I would really like to emulate Chandrasekhar. Managing to do so much and with such dedication for so many years. It’s incredible. Although, from what I’ve read of his later books (specifically the ones on general relativity and black holes) they are some what impenetrable filled as they are with pages of mathematical argument rather than physical discussion. 


[]

“Thus, it’s not physiological decay or mental ossification, or even being overwhelmed with other responsibilities, that causes creative decline in older scientists, but a failure of courage—courage to forsake the field of expertise in which they are respected or even revered for a field to which they have no more claim than anyone else.”
pg. 387

Once again courage is found to be a necessary virtue outside of explicitly moral frames. But maybe saying these creative scientists have courage is too easy. It certainly took courage for me to continue on to graduate school, but I don’t think it took that much courage to move from high energy physics to something else. It took clarity and some measure of personal integrity which on second thought are often precursors to courage. 

Perhaps what would be helpful in building this courage is to choose work not necessarily based on the techniques you’ve currently mastered, but grounded within that same condition which led you to master these techniques in the first place: curiosity. If you are paying attention to what you are interested in and making time to pursue these novel interests in spite of the steepness of the learning curve you experience upon entering a new field, then maybe you can save yourself from being saddled with tired ideas and ways of doing work. 

[]


What does the exploratory scientist need in the way of funding and equipment? Most of us, I suspect, came here thinking that as science progresses, research necessarily becomes more complicated and more expensive. We must therefore pour ever larger sums of money into ever larger institutes crammed with ever more expensive equipment and run by ever larger staffs. \textbf{Yet the scientists we remember as the great explorers of the last century never accepted the claim that money buys insight.} Ramon y Cajal wrote in 1923, ‘At the present time there exist in Spain laboratories so richly endowed that they are the envy of the greatest scholars of other countries. Yet, in them little or nothing is produced. The fact is that our statesmen and educational institutions have forgotten two important things: that to declare oneself an investigator is not sufficient to be one; and that \tbf{discoveries are made by men and not by scientific apparatus and overflowing libraries.} . . . For scientific work the means are almost nothing, the man very nearly everything. 
pg. 394

[. . .] Many echoed Fleming’s warning against working in a scientific ‘palace’: ‘I have known research workers reduced to impotence by apparatus so fine and elaborate that they spend all their time playing with it.’ For the successful investigator, ‘the palace becomes . . . an ordinary laboratory. If the palace wins, he is lost.’

Breakthrough experiments are almost always simple experiments. And simple experiments are inexpensive. 

pg. 397

I wonder if one can make similar statements about the use of mathematics in physical theories. A naive perspective on the relationship with physics and mathematics is that the more mathematical the theory the more sophisticated it is and the more physically important. This leads to a ranking of physical theories which places high energy physics at the tippity-top of physics and biological physics and the bippity-bottom.

But there are arguably papers in biological physics which are more important to physics than some of the work done today in high energy physics. The former uses calculus, algebra, and linear algebra while the latter uses the heights of modern mathematics. Perhaps the problem is—as bernstein later cites—is that the sophistication of the apparatus causes people to be distracted and seduced by the apparatus itself rather than some question to which it can be directed. Simpler constructs—both mathematical and experimental—are built for the express purpose of answering a specific questions and thus do not contain extraneous, but interesting features, which can pull one away from the question itself. 

Back when I was working (or rather struggling to work) in the field, my problem with many high energy theory papers was that they were the result of so many iterations of speculation based on speculation that the papers seemed to be abstract, not for the common physical reason of building intuition or simplicity, but merely for the sake of abstractness. Many were intensely mathematical, but didn’t seem to contain results interesting to mathematicians, and certainly didn’t produce results relevant to the larger body of physicists. It seemed that these researchers had become so untethered from reality that they stopped valuing descriptions and instead were faithful to the mathematical substitute built in its place. 

[]

So when and where is the need for freedom and independence fulfilled in our system? Peter Debye said: ‘It’s not filled at all. the real sense of independence comes only with great wealth, or with a man who says, ‘It does not matter to me’—people who are willing to forgo the usual rewards of the profession in return for personal freedom.’ ‘I did what I did in spite of the educational system,’ reports Julius Axelrod, who, like Crick, earned his Ph.D. (in this case at age forty-four) only after doing some of his best work. He is joined by several other eminent scientists who also escaped the ‘Ph. D. octopus’ as Williams James called it: J.B.S. Haldane, whose only degree was a B.A. in Classics, and Nobel laureates Allan Cormack and Godfrey Hounsfield, who invented computer tomography. None of them had an advanced degree in science. These men made their own opportunities. How many potential inventors are being lost because they look at the system and can’t see how to circumvent it or find the rare opportunities for freedom within it?

pg. 401



This is what I dread: that science will die from its own emphasis on uniformity, conformity, and relevancy—uniformity imposed by techniques of mass education that insist everyone learn to produce the same answer by the same path of reasoning; conformity imposed by the need to work in large groups and to appease and appeal to the ignorant masses of bureaucrats and legislators who’ve come to dominate the monetary aspects of the enterprise; and relevance imposed by the need to demonstrate immediate and applicable results. We forget that the greatest breakthroughs in science have always come from individuals satisfying their own curiosity in the search for understanding, not from government mandated programs.

What it comes down to is this, Richter. We so overtrain scientists these days that technical proficiency with abstruse mathematics and experimental techniques replaces thinking. Students are drilled in the most sophisticated solutions we’ve invented and come to expect such sophistication of every aspect of science. Then they begin arguing as you do, and that’s where the problem begins. Simple solutions aren’t any rare today than a hundred years ago. What prevents them from being invented and recognized is this unsound notion that everything simple has already been discovered; that what’s left must therefore be complicated; and that complicated problems have complicated solutions. Not true. Not true at all!

\item[--] \tbf{What questions does this book answer?}

The book seeks to determine the conditions necessary and the processes of thought and administration employed in order to make important discoveries in science. I don’t think the author spends too much time delineating what he sees as an important discovery, but he rather comprehensively documents the way illumination, thinking styles, and playing factor into making discoveries.

\item[--] \tbf{What questions does the book leave unanswered?}

The book doesn’t talk about the role of both racial and gender discrimination in the chapter on “Obstacles and Inducements to Research.” It also doesn’t discuss how the culture of the larger society, for example how the larger society views authority or family units, affects the way scientists (who are inevitably products, but not inevitable products of that society) do their work. It is said, for example, that Western scientists have (or had?) a more egalitarian approach to science than East Asian scientists. 

\item[--] \tbf{Why are these questions important?}

Deconstructing the way scientists discover new knowledge can help us better create institutions and scientists to further new discoveries. From a less practical/pragmatic perspective this knowledge can inform how the individual scientists does his or her work and consequently can lead him/her to question the motivation and purposes of his research. Such questioning, if not necessarily resulting in improving the research, will deepen the researcher’s self knowledge. 

\item[--] \tbf{What other works are related to this book?}

There is a book by a geologist called “How to discover things in science,” or something like that. Hadamard has a book as well, which I plan to read next, called The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field. Disciplined Minds discusses some of what Bernstein describes in his “Obstacles and Inducements to Research,” chapter. Bernstein himself also deconstructs the way scientists solve problems (as distinct from the way they supposedly solve problems) in “How Scientists Really Think”

\item[--] \tbf{How has this book changed how you understand $X$?}

Book has changed my understanding of why research seems to be propelled by young investigators. It is not necessarily because they are any more intelligent, but because they are less attached to established ways of working in the field. The book has also clarified my understanding of how funding and the external pressure it exerts on research can be detrimental to a scientist’s work. The model of scientific funding is sort of like a contracting model of research, one which doesn’t leave room for null results or large changes in direction.

Tips
Tips for daily writing

-First sentence: Before you begin your writing session, think only about the first sentence you want to write. Don’t try to envision the entire writing task because it will likely paralyze you.  Do not think about the entire projectEnvision/Think about the first sentence
-Free write: Free write for the first few minutes of the session. Don’t be too critical or self-editing during this period. The goal is to get words on the page
-Selection: After you’ve free written for a while, select out a few good sentences to act as a skeleton for the next draft.
-Cliff hanger: End your writing session on a cliff hanger so you can easily continue in the next session. When you start in a new session, start on unfinished paragraphs
-Recopy previous paragraphs: When you start a new writing session, rewrite poorly phrased or written paragraphs first. This eases you into the flow of writing and gives you an opportunity to re-edit. 

Tips for projects
-First (or next) calculation: Always think about the next calculation you want to do or question you want to ask. Don’t day dream about what the project means or its implications. Such dreams can make it difficult to deal with the details of the work. 
-Write it up immediately: Write up what you have completed of the work ever before you think the work is complete. Essentially, whenever you answer a new question write up your answer.
-Simplest model first: In building the intuition which can carry the work forward, work out the simplest model/expression of the idea and work out as many of its details as you can. It’s important to get this model well documented because it will be the archetype for future work

Statistical Mechanics and Irreversibility
I just had a really interesting conversation with Henry Wilkin. It started with me asking him something which a physics graduate student should arguably already know: How does microscopic reversibility lead to macroscopic reversibility? The standard explanation in statistical physics is really not an explanation at all. Namely we say that we can represent equilibrium thermal systems by a phase space and then the probability to be in a particular configuration of the phase space is proportional to the volume of said phase space. Such an explanation is more of a postulate than a derivation from classical mechanics. Henry’s answer consisted of a bunch of things I didn’t understand including things about Hamiltonian manifolds and the density of phase space, but ultimately everything sounded somewhat like the unrigorous explanations I disparaged before. But it’s possible that I didn’t really understand his answer. 

However, he also mentioned things that I remember reading about in Sethna’s text.  He said the solution I was looking for was in something called KAM theory and the problem was that it was difficult to demonstrate the things I wanted to be demonstrated if you went beyond few-particle systems and started observing chaos. As an apparently unrelated point, he said the Fermi Pasta Ulam system was an interesting system in that it demonstrated unexpected thermal properties. He also said he thought in the large N limit it became a conformal field theory, something I’m quite sure I’ve never heard of before.

In short he gave me a list of things I should explore further:
-KAM theory
-Fermi-Pasta-Ulam system
-FPU and conformal field theory
-chaotic systems in general.

Abstract drafts/trials
We pursue a relationship between determinants, geometry, and gaussian integrals to develop a limiting/approximate expression for Stokes theorem in terms of gaussian integrals.

Using the fundamental theorem of calculus we derive a relationship between gaussian integrals which allows us to express the integration over a domain as equivalent to another function evaluated on the boundaries of that domain.

Things to find notes on 
-Finite perimeter, but infinite area? Or infinite area and a finite perimeter?
-Volume of infinite dimensional manifolds? Would be like a functional integral over a determinant. Could we compute such a quantity? (In order to extend this to functional calculus)


One of the foundations of functional integral calculus is the fact that functional integrals can be expressed as determinants. These determinants are related to the vacuum to vacuum transition amplitudes for functional integrals and hence define the theory outside the presence of fields. This determinant expression arises from the fact that gaussian integrals over multi-dimensional variables can be written as an inverse product over the eigenvalues which compose their defining matrices. This is the way determinants are related to quantum field theory or statistical field theory. 

On the other side we know that the magnitude of the cross product between two vectors can be represented as a determinant which itself represents the area. This notion/relationship between determinants and area can be/is generalized when we compute the volume of manifolds defined by an arbitrary number of dimensions. To compute such volumes we express infinitesimal area/volume elements  as determinants of derivative matrix operators and integrate over them. Beyond this we can integrate functions over these volume elements, and the ultimate theorem expressing relationships between various functions integrated over distinct volume elements is Stokes theorem. 

An interesting/novel/worthwhile question is whether these two ideas can be related, that is whether we can relate the manifestation of determinants as gaussian integrals to the manifestation of determinants as integrals over volume. The ultimate result would not merely allow us to express the integration of functions over manifolds as gaussian integrals but perhaps would, through Stokes theorem, allow us to relate two different gaussian integrals. We work out the simplest one-dimensional example of these ideas and discuss what might be necessary for more complicated extrapolations





Two approaches
-one-dimensional ftc and gaussians
-elaborating/writing notes on ideas of talk

The dualistic relationship gravitation and quantum physics have with geometry and energy suggests we should explore the unusual/non-standard relationships between the four ideas. gravitation is often related to geometry but how is it related to energy. quantum physics is often related to energy but how is it related to geometry?


The soluble functional integral defines the energy density of the free field vacuum. How do geometric representations of this functional integral inform our understanding of quantum field theory?


This story, colloquial as it is, suggests that even in the few decades following their individual developments quantum physics and gravitation were conceived of as being at least heuristically related. 

The fact that an idea from general relativity was needed in order to resolve a paradox in quantum mechanics reveals that even in the few decades following their individual developments, quantum physics and gravitation could be conceived of as being, at least in one heuristic case, mutually consistent or even symbiotic. 

In recent decades, this symbiosis has been placed on firmer ground through the AdS/CFT correspondence. The original framing of the correspondence established an equivalence between a supersymmetric quantum field theory and a supergravitational theory in a higher dimension. Being supersymmetric, the quantum field theories and gravitational theories defining the correspondence, do not seem to suggest something about the apparently non-supersymmetric quantum and gravitational theories which model our world. Yet the correspondence still provides an interesting framework in which to explore ideas about the relationship between spacetime and quantum uncertainty. 

they provide an interesting model/context/framework to explore how ideas about the structure of spacetime can be related to quantum uncertainty. 

In recent decades this symbiosis/mutual compatibility has been pursued mostly/primarily in the context of  the AdS/CFT correspondence which equates certain correlation functions in a supersymmetric quantum field theory to ?? in a classical theory of supergravity. 


Beyond the formal structure of supersymmetric theories, the parallel between quantum physics and gravitation is also manifest in one of the modern motifs of physics: the relationship between geometry and energy. It is a well-known idea/concept/prediction of general relativity that the energy and momentum density of systems determine the geometric structure of the system’s space time. But something which is just as true, but less touted as physically profound, is that this relationship exists in quantum physics in the reverse direction. Namely, 

 But something which is less well-known (or at least less touted as important) is the way this relationship exists in quantum physics in the reverse direction: namely the geometry of a quantum system (typically defined by statements about the system’s boundary conditions) determines the resulting energy spectrum of the system. 

The archetypical example is the first system most students of quantum physics study: the infinite square wel. 

One of the themes which characterize 20th century physics is the relationship between geom- etry and energy. This relationship is most often associated with general relativity in which energy densities determine the spacetime curvature of a system. But it also exists in quantum physics in the reverse direction: the geometry of a quantum system (often specifically assump- tions about the system’s boundary conditions) determines the resulting energy spectrum of the system (e.g., for example, the infinite square well potential, or the hydrogen atom). 
Figure 1: Geometry and Energy in General Relativity and Quantum Physics 
Given this theme it is worth considering whether it would be possible to explore connections between geometry, energy, and quantum field theory. Such explorations have already been hinted at in work on topological quantum field theory, but I think it could be pushed in new directions by pursuing analogies in the mathematics of quantum field theory systems. Perhaps I could discuss one of these directions during the conference. 


This relationship has been further elaborated in

In Disturbing the Universe, Dyson describes what he thinks is the wonder of theoretical physics. He thinks of the electron, and of the Dirac equation which models it. He thinks to himself how strange and beautiful it is that the electron knows nothing about all the symbols and logical structure that man writes on paper and yet its properties and dynamics are perfectly described by man’s equations. Dyson places his focus on the fact that both the electron and man’s equations encompass a physical reality in spite of the fact that the electron cannot have any fidelity to what humans discover or invent. 

But I think this focus is wrong headed, or at least misplaced. The surprise exists in the mirror of the world through our equations and the fact that this mirror so deeply resembles the world itself. The wonder exists in the order this mirroring suggests and also in the fact that we are capable of discerning it. But mostly it is not about us, it is about a universe governed by principles and laws and being faithful to them, long before humans ever conjured the notion of faith to begin with.

Premonition of the Fall

In the weeks before Tony left for Florida, I had felt a growing distance between us. I ignored it, or tried my best to. It would take him hours or a day to respond to texts for conversation threads he started. He was distracted when we were together, uninterested in physical intimacy, constantly playing candy crush on his phone. After he disappeared and after denial gave way to anger and then despair I cursed myself for not seeing the subtle premonitions of a loss for what they were, not apparitions born from my own insecurities but sirens forewarning a crash. He was there telling my who he was—or at least what our relationship had become—but I was not listening because I was too attached to what the relationship had been, too grateful for the fate it had saved me from. 

The end came long before I came to peace with the idea that I would never speak to him again. He had vanished and by the middle of September I was struggling against emotional upheaval and self-hatred. But in the ten days following our last meeting, the separation I had felt weeks before grew and grew and I began to imagine a life without him, and thus I began to lay the foundations for the healing which would ultimately close him from my life. 

The day after Amy returned from her trip to Sacramento, she came to my house on Parkdale. She was wearing her grey night gown which doubled as an evening dress. She looked beautiful and I heard my heart as clearly as I heard her footfalls before she entered. It was strange to see her like this, five months into our relationship and seemingly more radiant than she was that first night we spent together. Rationality pointed to the medication. I had received a new prescription for Celexa, one that I think less dampened my libido, and in the days prior to that night I was feeling excited in ways I had not felt in years. She followed me to my room and I sat down as she stood above me. My hands roamed her calves, and her thighs and her back and her neck. I grabbed her legs and pushed by nose into her midsection, breathing her in deeply. Our plan was to get dinner. She suggested we get dinner later. 

Afterward I stood above her, looking at her and not seeing what I expected to see. We had slept together at least twenty times before, but this moment seemed different, she looked different. Watching her, I felt like I was peering down from the summit of a cliff, simultaneously feeling the high of the zenith and fearing the terror of the fall. What was happening? I found myself longing for her like I hadn’t weeks before. I had always been cool, and now I was losing whatever equanimity I had built up. And with this also came a loss of power and a loss of innocence. I recognized the path I had found myself on, and I knew where it would lead.

It was the tragedy of my and Tony’s relationship that when I began to fall in love with him, he, for whatever reason, began to fall out of infatuation with me. It was when I compared my time with him to my time spent with other people, and decided how much more I enjoyed the former, that he seemed to become more preoccupied with other matters in his life. In truth, he was applying to many jobs, preparing to make a geographic and vocational transition, so he was understandably distracted. But there was nothing in me which felt these were legitimate reasons. Instead, I grew angry, I grew livid, I felt pain and I wondered how I could be so vulnerable to someone so cavalier and so irresponsible with my emotions. Didn’t he know how crazy it drove me to wait hours for him to respond to my texts? Didn’t he know that I wanted to be with him?

I loved him, and I was held at the behest of his whims and his dance of interest and apathy. I saw it all and I could not help it. I was beholden to him; until I was not. There was, as there often is, a breaking point, a moment when the decision flows through you and you ride it because you know it will set you free as surely as it will destroy you. The result was I was able to let him go. My superficial explanation of this ability is self serving: Tony took liberties with our relationship he did not know the consequences of. More deeply, he did not listen closely enough when I told him about my insecurities, he did not see how he himself was placed in the story of those insecurities and how his actions would inevitably, and perhaps unfairly, be interpreted through lenses shaped by past experiences in which he had no role.

I am talking about Tony but my mind is on Amy. The physicist understands the world through archetypes. An idealization is constructed; all information about the idealization is sought out and built up; and through the idealization’s close approximation to the world, the physicist can say something about a reality which should be indifferent to man’s models of it. My relationship with Tony, or rather my understanding of it, is that archetype and Amy is the world. I am trying to place my relationship with her in a context in which I can benefit from the lessons of past failures, but I keep running into edge cases and exceptions. Our relationship is different, if not for the reason that it is between a man and a woman, certainly because Amy has succeeded in doing what most people have failed to do: make me feel less lonely. The nature of the end will not wash away all the beauty of everything preceding it, but it will likely imbue it with a shade which encourages or discourages nostalgia. What is more clear are the extremes. Any sense of betrayal I take from the end will destroy the hope in life and in the world which has been growing every since I met her. The trees, the road, the people I pass by every day will become something else. Amy and the faith I drew from our relationship will be gone, and although I know I will survive it, I do not know what kind of life will come after survival. 

And now, as I am trying to “come to terms” with the initial steps toward the dissolution of the thing which made life appear worthy of faith and hope and all the beautiful things poets talk about, I have to contend with the last thing I want to be thinking about right now: my work. In a few days I will begin teaching MITES, in the same course I took nine years ago, the course where I met Hyun Youk and began the acceleration which has propelled me to where I am now. I had believed there was something romantic about returning to the setting of one’s origins, seeing it again from mature eyes, measuring yourself against what you were and what you have become. Now, I am not so sure. So many of my insecurities remain intact, my frailties and vices threaten to destroy me daily, and I cannot escape the sense that I am constantly wrong, the paradox of feeling uniquely dissonant in a world so full of its own dissonances and contradictions. Maybe at the end of our journeys we return to where we began and the true benefit of the return is to know the things the journey cannot (and may never) fix, the hunger which forced us out still not sated and still demanding that we start the search again.

On Fraternities and Fountainheads and Kipnis

If you don’t see something happen does it mean it does not exist? This is not one of those socratic questions, ones meant to clarify and open the mind by revealing hidden assumptions. It rather reflects a legitimate concern of mine because of what I’m trying to say in this essay. I want to talk about Rand and fraternities and about how each have affected me in ways unique but mutually commensurate. But to talk about fraternities in America today would require me to, for a time, talk about how fraternities are implicated in the crimes of “privilege” and “patriarchy”, to discuss the pain behind these words and about underserved and abused power and the societal confluence of these factors in the mismanagement of female bodies in college life. But I have never experienced these things vicariously or directly while I was at Nu Delta. How could I discuss their implications without experiences which lend my discussion legitimacy.
Moreover, what struck me as astonishing about Kipnis’s criticism of fraternity life was how categorical it was and how unable I was to levy any experiential or rational rebuttal to her claim that if one really wanted to root out sexual assault on campus, one would simply— and it is the “simply” here which is so offensive to me—eliminate all fraternities. 

Is she right?

Both Zeus and Sisyphus 
Something is wrong. The distance that I previously intuited between Amy and I seems to have only grown and deepened. Maybe it’s that we have passed the honeymoon period and we are now forced to reconcile differences in history and temperament which were always there. Maybe we are experiencing the waxing and waning of closeness and love that I hear is typical of long-term relationships. Maybe when Amy went to California and had a chance to envision her life after Cambridge, she became less attached to Cambridge and all the things and people which previously grounded her here. 

The last one was her explanation for the distance. Well enough, I guess, but in spite of the reasons behind it, after perceiving a seemingly gratuitous distance from her for the second time in our relationship I must admit that I no longer trust her. And without this trust, I find that the desire for distance which was previously emanating from her is now emanating from me. I stand next to her and I don’t want to touch her. She speaks and my mind wanders. I know what is happening. Without any conscious effort, something in me is preparing for the end. 

And nearing the horizon, nearing the cliff which will transport me to a place I may not be prepared to go, I turn and look back to see where I’m coming from, believing, but also knowing it to not be entirely true, that understanding where I was could help me understand how I got to where I am. 

The problem again is sex. Sex which was seemingly so crucial to the existence of our relationship is now unimportant. Moreover, she doesn’t seem as willing to interrogate this change as she was to interrogate my previous relative lack of interest. Her claim is that her thoughts and readings on celibacy, nuns, and, in general, world views in which sex was not the focal point of life and relationships have softened her attachment to sex in our relationship. What exacerbates the problem is that this newfound perspective is coming at a time when I feel (or, as of now, felt) closer to her and wanted even more to be with her physically. In the earlier days of our relationship, the few times I seemed just barely enthusiastic to have sex, she was reduced to tears. And yet now she seems to believe I should accept without complaint the nights that she is too tired to have sex. Back then, once when I told her I was too tired and on the verge of sleep, she told me I should have had sex with her before I felt sleepy. 

I have never been able to reconcile Amy’s views on sex in our relationship with her views on men’s supposed entitlement to women’s bodies. Like most women today, she believes the latter is wrong and is inherently violent in belief if not always in action. And yet Amy undoubtedly felt entitled to my body and my intimacy in our relationship. We never had a conversation about this dichotomy, and we likely never will. Like me and most people on this planet, Amy has a penchant for rationalizing the priorities of her pain over the pain of others. She would possibly be able to levy some reasons for why there is a difference and for why I should accept it, but the honest explanation most likely exists below all arguments and is reduced to the basic belief: I feel what I feel. 

Recognizing this hypocrisy in Amy is dispiriting. For some reason I had believed she could save me from my past and free me from the sense that women believed I had no real right to my own pain, but should take their possible pain into account in all things. But it seems Amy too is human, and I thus find myself falling into the belief that all women I encounter will have this double-standard where whatever they feel is more important than what I feel. 

So, I know I have to be careful here. I have often taken a single bad experience with a woman and extrapolated it too far and thus demonized whole swaths of people I had never met. And if I am to be selfish here for a moment, the crime in doing this was not really against these anonymous people who I had claimed to know. The true crime was always against myself. The crime, and ironically it’s punishment, was the psychological weight I force myself to carry each day, it was the self-sentencing to bear the load of rage, loathing, and simply unresolved pain from dawn to dusk and to dawn again. Being both judge and prisoner, both Zeus and Sisyphus, the tragedy existed almost entirely in the basic fact that I was never really under siege by a hostile world, but by myself. I was trapped in a cage of my own making, a cage whose bars and chains were built from the fantasies I could not let go and which the world had no duty to satisfy.

A mature perspective sees this truth as part of the resolution to my and Amy’s relationship problems: Recognizing that, just like the rest of the reality I experience, our relationship can be held hostage by dreams more necessary to my sense of safety than to the relationship’s existence. I have always liked to see myself as mature, vastly more mature than my peer group, but I do not know if this is an act of maturity I can live up to.

Understanding Malcom
When I first started writing Jamal and Cristina I had never expected the story to be about someone other than myself. It was my insecurities which were most intensely reflected in Jamal, not anyone else's. By a reasonable stretch I could consider him an amalgam of Nahom and I, but nothing more. And yet as I hear and learn and watch more about Malcom’s fall from grace and his descent into a mental state which cannot be labeled anything other than insanity, I am realizing the story is as much about him as it was about me, and in so far as the story is one about both of us, it is also a story about men and their relationship not only with women, but with each other and with the world which acts/exists as the backdrop to all of those relationships. 

It is not true that men—after repeated female rejection—only see in their future two possible options. It is not true that the choices are between anger and passivity, between hostility and calibrated disinterest. There too is a third option, one which Malcom seems to be taking and this option of course is not so much divorced from the other two as merely preceding them. What you do today is not divorced from what you will do tomorrow: One follows the other in sequence, and, just as surely, what Malcom is doing now is laying the stones for him to walk  upon in the months to follow. My fear—deep and unyielding—is that he will not make it through this period of months. For he is lost, but he does not know he is lost, and so he makes no attempts to make it easier for other people to find him and to return him to where he once was. 

What Malcom is seeing in his own actions, in the way people respond to those actions is not reality but some facsimile of it. We all do this to some extent and we can measure our maturity in inverse proportion to how tightly we hold on to the stories we believed as children. Escaping these stories, for me at least, required seeing them in unforgiving relief to the world which existed in their backdrop. That summer of 2014, all of my defenses seemingly melted away and I found myself with nothing I valued, and with only inertia pushing me towards a reconsolidation of anything resembling a continuous identity. 

But as far as I can tell, Malcom was never one for self-doubt, never one for existential insecurity, never one to interrogate whether the things he was feeling were the things of capital R reality or of that subjective reality each of us constructs to protect ourself from…from what exactly? It’s not clear to me what Malcom is running away from either subconsciously or consciously. The one thing I wish is for Malcom to one day (soon) return to his friends and admit that his past behavior was disconcerting if not patently crazy, and to then state all the things that sane people state when they return from a lapse in sanity. But, my guess is that if Malcom does eventually return to earth and to his friends, it will not be the way of the Orpheus, returning empty handed but alive, but the way of Icarus. 

Hearing the stories about him makes me wonder what it feels like to stand at the precipice of something, something you think is grand and beautiful and worthy of appreciation by all, but to stand alone. The feeling must be something quite different from the loneliness I and many people have felt much of our adult lives, something different from what I felt when I ate lunch by my self so many of those time during high school. If I were not speaking of Malcom, I would believe the state to come with some question which would transmute the loneliness into fear and the sadness into trepidation. In the stories of heroes encountering the grand and the beautiful and encountering it alone, there is nothing at all hinting at a questioning of their reality, there appears to be nothing which leads them to ask themselves whether the world as it is presented to them is the world as everyone else sees it. The feel they already know the answer, for it is present in the fact of their loneliness itself, for if everyone saw the world as they say it, everyone would be where they were and they would not be alone. So such people do not question the correctness of their state, the correctness of their actions. They simply travel headlong into what seems like unforgiving space to everyone else, passing in minutes the emptiness and silence of ice, debris, and the invisible remnants of exploding stars, all the while they are moving toward something which to us seems like nothing at all. 

It would only be fair for Malcom to be questioning what is real to his world (although he is almost assuredly not doing so), as this entire episode concerning him is causing me to question what is real to mine. Is it true that the guy I danced with, the guy I sang with the guy with whom I spent three years at MIT is now stalking women, sending them sexual messages, seeing their distance as mere affirmation for his need to try again? Is this now a part of my reality? Or have I yet to wake up from some terrible dream? Or more honestly, am I only now waking up, and discovering the world is not what I had always presumed it to be. 

When I told Amy that I saw much of myself in Malcom, she responded with fear. Through lack of foresight on my part, this announcement was made minutes before I told her that my own fear was that Malcom would go the way of Rodgers and Cho and in a matter of months we would find him on the evening news, both victim and perpetrator of that uniquely American violence. Was I, she wanted to know, saying that I too would have ended up massacring women and men had she and I not been together? Had she in fact saved me from being a person she had never believed I was and who she would now not want to be with even if I was now indeed safe? None of my answers were convincing to her, and I suppose this was because none of my answers unequivocally denounced Rodgers and Cho. I saw nuances that she did not see, nuances built from years of feeling as though I was walking in their shoes, nuances from recognizing that the evil in them was also in me and that it could, if I were not vigilant and lucky, swallow me and destroy me and end everything I loved as surely as everything they loved had ended. 

I could not convince Amy in the moment of why the issue was complicated, of why her continued questions were not bringing us closer in understanding but pushing us farther apart in difference. She was a 21st century woman who experienced the world quite differently from the way I experienced it and the fact that my experiences were implicated within the narratives of patriarchy and sexual violence meant that the pain I felt had to be filtered and distilled through a criteria which judged it as invalid if it had any hint of what Amy saw as entitlement. Amy did not see me or my experiences and she did not want to see them because she was threatened by them and afraid. It is not a surprise that the conversation we had changed the way I saw her, diluted the fantasy and thus made me less attached not merely to the fantasy but to its central protagonist. I had always wanted to believe that I was the kind of person, who when faced with reality would calmly and responsibly walk into it recognizing it is really the only place I could build an enduring home, but rather it seems that I, like most people, am just as attached to the sanity-keeping fantasies which get me through the day. The fact that my fantasies are different from their own, lends me not any additional moral repute, but merely a particular shade in a vast spectrum of terrible grey.

Large N systems and Emergence, Outline

-Anderson’s ideas of More is Different
-Large N can refer to the number of degrees of freedom in the system. Relativistic quantum mechanics becomes (i.e., we have to replace) relativistic quantum field theory when we take the number of particle degrees of freedom to infinity. 
-Wave Equation? (Central Limit Theorem?)
-Strong and Weak Emergence: (Reference the philosophical paper and make note of the difference) Strong emergence refers to something we know emerges from an existing phenomena but cannot be explained by recourse to the underlying phenomena
Weak emergence refers to when new properties emerge from a system with many degrees of freedom and we can mathematically derive these new properties from the underlying system (although doing so often requires providing the system with a new formulation 
Strong emergence
-Life, Consciousness, Social Communities
Weak emergence
-Condensed Matter Physics (super-conductivity, bose condensation), Statistical Physics, Field Theory
-Hyun’s picture
-21st century science. Future directions perhaps don’t consist of moving ever inward but ever outward. 

Sunday June 25, 2017 — 1:31 PM
Details of the dream that Amy recounted to me, on the morning of June 25 2017 about half an hour after we had sex. (Dream happened at night, before the sex)
- She begins at Microsoft attending a work function
- Then she is some how (and for some reason) riding a horse. But the horse is quite small. It’s more of a pony with stubby legs and a fat body very close to the ground
- Suddenly bedlam ensues wherever she is and people run and escape but she is left behind. 
- She runs to a house filled with women and children. She wants to get to back to Microsoft but she stays in the house
- The house is really creepy and there is a pool next to it with small sized orcas
- A day passes 
- Amy wants to leave the house but an evil old woman (a witch?), will not let her leave
- Amy eventually escapes and searches for her car
- She finds an outpost but she doesn’t find her car. Soon afterwards Amy wakes.

The Importance of Archetype

Today I will have my seventh lecture in the MITES program. This means I am at the halfway point in the course and should have had enough experiences to reflect upon. 

Starting from the second day of class, I have assigned a short exercise in the first five minutes of class. The exercise served three purposes: One, it provided an intellectual warm up for students who were just returning from lunch; Two it gave me a chance to expose the students to material I would introduce later in lecture; And three, it gave me daily feedback as to how the students were (or were not) learning the material. 

And this third purpose turned out to be the most significant, because whereas I might have believed (and defended to near-death!) the idea that my students were successfully internalizing the basics of what I was teaching the starter problems repeatedly revealed this to not be the case. Even beyond internalizing what I was teaching, it was clear from the start that the students were used to solving a problem of a completely different kind. For the first starter problem, I gave the students the function x(t)  = A cos (omega t) + B sin (omega t) and I told them it was equivalent to the function x(t) = E cos(omega t - phi). I then asked them to find E and phi in terms of A and B. I thought this was a good problem for the students because as somewhat advanced Juniors who had taken a calculus course before, they had surely seen the sum of angles formula for cosine and sine functions. So I imagined this problem would be trivially easy for most of the class. Instead, only two out of 16 students solved the problem correctly. The other students perhaps  thinking this was a problem similar to the linear-system of equations problems they had seen before, tried to solve for E and phi as though they were solving a linear system. Thus they ended up with messy answers which included omega and t. 

In another instance, I gave the students the differential equation for simple harmonic motion except with the “wrong sign” for the spring constant. I asked them to find the general solution to the equation and then to find a specific solution. The correct general solution was a sum of two exponentials with one term increasing in time and the other term decreasing in time. Finding this solution would have required beginning with the differential equation for the system, guessing an exponential solution, and then finding the two possible values of the undefined parameter in the exponential solution. Instead many students began from the general solution to the harmonic oscillator equation of motion and then replaced omega with i omega where i = sqrt(-1). Mathematically, speaking this is correct because sine functions with imaginary arguments can sometimes be taken to be real. But the students did not know this, which of course posed problems when they tried to solve the second part of the problem. 

In another case, I showed the students a mass attached in parallel to two springs and asked the students what the effective spring constant was. Encouragingly many students answered this problem correctly, but some students started writing down differential equations and trying to solve for something. 

Ever since I started handing out these problems I have been trying to understand why my expectations of what students should be able to do have been so different from what they are actually able to do. 
For one, these starter problems have revealed to me something I have always known but chose to ignore this summer: Lecturing is perhaps a good way to convey information-based knowledge but it is not a good way for students to develop procedural knowledge. I mean, why would I expect the students to know how to solve problems they had no prior practice in solving?  (Well for one, I thought the problems were decidedly simple, but simplicity is relative, and as an instructor I should engage with the students’ level of understanding and not be overly attached to my belief in the understanding they should have.)

Also for some context, these are high school students many of whom took physics courses in classes where they were the best student and yet where the course could have been a lot more rigorous than it was. So many of them are likely both overconfident and underprepared, a dangerous mix when encountering new and difficult material. 
The structure of lecture and students’s backgrounds are relatively fixed (the latter more so than the former), so in terms of things I can fix in the moment I have thought more specifically of what I am asking the students to do: Solve problems. Recently, I have narrowed down the student’s difficulty something specific to how physics education proceeds and to something I can relate to. Yesterday, Jiwon showed me a problem given by a J.J. Clement, a physics education researcher, to some professors and graduate students. Here is the problem prompt: 

A weight is hung on a spring (Fig. 1). The original spring is replaced with a spring made
of the same kind of wire, with the same number of coils, but with coils that are twice as
wide in diameter. Will the spring stretch from its natural length more, less, or the same
amount under the same weight? (Assume the mass of the spring is negligible.) Why do
you think so?

Looking at this problem, I recognized it immediately as a strange one. It is not at all like any of the problems found in Kleppner’s and Kolenkow’s or Morin’s excellent mechanics text. One need not consider a differential equation, analyze forces, or write down a Lagrangian. There is, in short, no archetype upon which to base an attempt at a solution. Thus it was really an excellent problem to give to physicists because although physics education is primarily meted out through internalizing and practicing various archetypes, the ultimate goal of that education (I think) is to make it possible for physicists to move beyond archetypes and successfully understand problems they had not seen before. 

It was clear that the students were using some archetype to solve the problems, I gave them but they were using the incorrect one. I would give them a problem they had not seen before (but which I felt was quite similar to problems I had previously discussed), and they would tackle it with an amalgam of mathematics which was often not relevant to the true solution. But they could not intuit this true solution because they did not understand/know the problem situation for which it was simply a special case. 

The students are given a lot of information and they perhaps do not know how to organize it all. They do not know which information is the most important/fundamental, which information should be memorized, which information should be derived, which should be used as a model for solving problems. The students were using the wrong archetypes because they did not know what the archetypes were and so they did not know when to apply them. 

I actually don’t completely think this is a valid explanation, but before I critique it I should define what an archetype is. 

An archetype can roughly be seen as synonymous with an example but I think it stands in for something more general and important than an example. In physics or applied mathematics, an archetype is a problem-solution pair which exists as a model for which other different problem-solution pairs can be based. The study of physics at both the undergraduate and graduate level could largely be reduced to a study of the ideas and formalism of various discipline paired with a study of the many different problem archetypes which allow physicists to solve the various problems in the subject. Working through the assignments in a physics course is tantamount to working through the various archetypes which define the subject.

But students learn physics through the use of archetypes in much the same way that people learn how to ride bikes by beginning with training wheels: The student begins with archetypes, but these archetypes are primarily a device used in order to learn the fundamentals of the discipline. Ultimately, someone who understands the material should be able to think about it and engage with it without the use of archetypes. 

(Maybe the training wheels analogy isn’t a good one. Archetypes are definitely more fundamental and important to physics than training wheels are to bike riding. Perhaps a better analogy is to take archetypes to be like well-paved and well-trodden paths through a city. Learning many of these paths allows you to learn the lay of the city and hopefully gives you the knowledge and confidence to leave a paved path and find your way (to wherever you’re going) without one.)

Thus Clement’s paper poses an interesting question: Does physics education inculcate you in the correct archetypes to use or does it teach you to think beyond archetypes so that you are capable of solving problems which fit no format you have seen before. In my opinion, physicists—and perhaps the larger culture in so far as it thinks at all about physicists—would certainly like to think it’s the latter but in what part of their education is the latter practiced?

But so far I’m not even trying to get my students to think “beyond archetypes”. I’m just trying to teach them the archetypes themselves. But maybe given that the students do not seem to have internalized these archetypes and problem solving is seen as a sort of rigorous and organized form of thinking, perhaps teaching the students the current physics archetypes is tantamount to teaching them to move beyond the archetypes they currently hold.

Loose ends






When learning a subject spending more time struggling with difficult problems will result in deeper and more efficient learning than spending an equivalent amount of (or even more) time on straight forward problems. The depth comes from the fact that the difficult problems discuss situations/techniques that the simpler problems do not. And the efficiency comes from the fact that working through the difficult problems will often require you to navigate the conceptual and technical structure of the simpler problems.
I wonder if this is how the students sometimes feel when they try to solve some of the problems I give them. They feel they have never seen the problem before and they are thus at a loss as from what they should extrapolate a procedure.
Beyond the archetypes themselves its clear that physicist do not/should not be beholden to/trapped by/confined by them. Rather physicists should learn how to think beyond archetypes

The Problem with Archetypes

There are two days of lecture left in MITES. To say that the summer has flown by would not be accurate, but it would also be inaccurate to say that I am not surprised how quickly I have come to the end. And being so near that end I can’t help but be led into a sort of reflective pose, one which I should forestall because it is not yet the end, but which I nevertheless encourage because I know it will better ensure I consolidate all the lessons I’ve learned before they are lost to the firmament. 

To be clear, I should not be calling this discussion an outline of “Lessons” because it is not yet clear what concrete practices or new knowledge I should extrapolate from the things I have observed. Rather teaching this course has alerted me to problems and questions which I had not previously encountered in my own studies. These questions will hopefully be answered more definitively in the future, so I don’t want to stifle any future insights by pretending that I have all the necessary insights now. 

Enough with the throat clearing! The first observation has to do with what I previously called archetypes. After assigning the first few assignments and some starter problems—the latter of which are really excellent because you get to see the student’s thought processes as close to realtime as you can get—I realized that the way I expected the students to solve the problems was quite different from the ways they actually solved the problems. The example that I previously mentioned was illustrative. For one starter problem, I stated that an anti-hookean force F(x) = +kx was exerted on a mass m. I asked the students to find x(t) given that the mass started at x_0 and that after infinite time it was at the origin. The way most students solved the problem was to start by noting that the equation of motion for this system was like the equation of motion for simple harmonic motion, but with an “imaginary” angular frequency. From here they went straight to the general solution of the simple harmonic oscillator equation and replaced the omegas in the argument of the sinusoids with \sqrt(-1) times omega. Seeing an imaginary quantity in the argument of a trig function, most students seemed to have become confused and stopped trying to solve the problem. 

These qualities are representative of the student approaches to other similar questions. I would give the students a novel problem context, one which could only be solved by reworking the methods they had used to workout the standard solution, and the students would take the shallowest approach to finding an answer, often some algebraic analog to the “plug-in-numbers” solutions of their past physics assignments. 

First, I had no idea why the students were taking the approaches they did. Their approaches seemed either inefficient or too closely based on problem situations which were quite different from the one they were currently tasked with solving. Upon reflection, I realized it was really this second property which was the salient feature of their solutions and it was a feature which, far from being nonsensical, had a very reasonable logic to it. Mainly I had to acknowledge that these students are not stupid, which is to say they do not lack the ability to recognize patterns, extrapolate from those patterns, and acquire new information from the similarities and differences of the extrapolation. Rather it was the patterns they were using to solve problems which were deficient. 

My current (admittedly rough) conception of their previous physics education boils down to the students reading a textbook, writing down formulas, and then solving end of chapter problems where they plug numbers into the formulas to obtain other numbers. The students who are taking my course have, on average, taken a year of high school physics, so they are likely well-inculcated in the habit of receiving formulas that they simply use as number-generating machines. The problems I assign to the students rarely have numbers in them, but if you aren’t paying too close attention you can certainly approach them as if they did. Namely, you could start with a previously derived formula and then slightly modify the parameters in the formula to try to match this new context. This what many of my students were doing. 

So it eventually became clear that my students were engaging with a particular model of problem solving, but it was a rather shallow one. Problem solving in physics largely rests on extrapolating from existing problem archetypes to new problem contexts you have not studied before. I was giving them all the standard formalism for oscillations, damped oscillations, and forced oscillations but my students were using this formalism rather shallowly. This was partly due to inadequacies in the previous archetypes they encountered in high school; if you give students “plug and chug” examples of physics problems, they soon think that all physics problems consist of “plug and chug” manipulations. In a sentence, shallow archetypes—and continual engagement with shallow archetypes—lead to shallow engagement with any future archetypes. 

(Archetype: an archetype is a problem which is used as a paradigmatic model to solve other problems in a physics discipline. The most important archetypes in a subject in physics can often be boiled down to the 60 or so canonical problems that a student works through when taking a course on the subject.)

I call an archetype “shallow” if it does not interrogate the underlying structure or formalism of a physics subject. Such shallow archetypes take the equations in a subject as divined by god and bestowed upon mortals whose only task is rearranging symbols and replacing them with numbers when necessary. Virtually all of physics education consists of teaching students how to use the archetypes they know to answer the questions they don’t. What I have learned from this class is that teaching students through such shallow archetypes really retards their future education. 

I intuited this myself when I was first learning physics. I began with Halliday and Resnick which has roughly 80 problems for each chapter. The problems begin very simply at first with but later progress to more involved application problems. I solved many problems in this book, but months later, when I started learning from Kleppner and Kolenkow, I was surprised to learn that I couldn’t really solve the problems in K and K. There were much fewer problems per chapter, but all the problems were interesting  and required thinking about the formalism of mechanics more carefully than in the slapdash calculations of H and R. I eventually started using K and K to learn topics I had skipped in H and R. After working through the problems in K and K, I returned to the relevant chapters in H and R to discover that I could solve (or at least approach) many of the more difficult application-type problems. 

In short, and unsurprisingly, after engaging with shallow archetypes, I subsequently found it difficult to work through challenging problems using problem models beyond those shallow archetypes, but by working with deeper archetypes I found it rather easy to work through the application-type problems. This experience developed in me the conviction that spending an hour on a difficult problem probably nets more learning than spending an hour working through many much easier problems. 

I think you could contest this by saying that if you have so little idea of how to approach a difficult problem that you cannot even begin, it is certainly better to work through easier problems first. I concede there is a psychic reward for solving any physics problem, but I would argue that solving the easier problems could lead to a false confidence which makes you believe the subject is what it, in fact, is not and your knowledge of the subject is deeper than it actually is. 

Archetypes in Research

The role of archetypes in physics is omnipresent. It exists not only in how students learn a subject but also in how researchers do research. 

From a wide perspective, whenever a scientist writes a paper, she is basing her idea of a finished product on some model of what she thinks a finished product should look like. The apprenticeship process in physics is centered around students emulating research practices—both methodology and perhaps even styles of questions—observed from advisors and even their peers. This is a fact of scientific research that took me a long time to understand: not everyone does science the same way, and moreover not everyone enjoys the same kind of science. And so the conflicts I had with Jesse’s and Ariel’s research arose because, unbeknownst to me, I had a clear idea of what kind of physics research I wanted to do and the projects I was being assigned were not it. Because I couldn’t even really see it myself, neither Jesse nor Ariel could see the intellectual dissonance I felt when I was working on the problems they assigned, and so it was really up to me to develop my own way of working. 

Now that I have come closer to solidifying this way of working, I can now understand part of my general apathy toward much of the physics literature. I like some of Feynman’s papers, some of Weinberg’s papers, one of Salam’s papers, and I think some of England’s current work is interesting but I largely find most physics work uninteresting. This lack of interest is partly due to a lack of understanding of the general field of work, but I now realize it is also due to the qualities of the work itself. It deals with questions or a type of questioning that I’m just not that enamored by. 

From a closer perspective, the archetypes of a subject define not only the canon of the subject but the problems to which that canon can be applied. And finding some dissonance with a subject could stem from a lack of interest in the subject itself, or rather the archetypes (grounded in particular questions) which define it. 

After I had spent some years learning it, my main contention with quantum field theory was that it roughly boiled down to a somewhat tedious formalism for answering very niche and abstruse questions about particle interactions. Uther in the Rethinking workshop characterized the problem pretty well: “In QFT you calculate scattering amplitudes and the two-loop correction to blah blah blah, and after all of it I’m just like ‘I really don’t care.’ The archetypes and problem frameworks of QFT are geared towards answering questions of interest to particle theorists and condensed matter theorist, which is not at all surprising considering the people who most often take QFT. But compared to the unique mathematical tools of QFT (e.g., the functional integral), these particle interaction questions are not that interesting to me. 

Problem archetypes follow naturally from the principles and mathematical framework of a discipline but they are only developed in pursuit of certain types of questions. Thus my fault with the archetypes which monopolize quantum field theory is in fact a fault with the types of questions for which these archetypes are the answer. But because archetypes follow naturally from the principles and mathematical framework, and are in fact only specified by the types of investigations we consider, there is hope that one can forego the existing archetypes and develop new ones simply by asking new questions. 

Feynman’s work on path integrals provides an example of the development and the importance of new archetypes. When Feynman began his work on path integrals, the existing archetypes of quantum mechanics were centered around Hamiltonians, eigenkets, and energy eigenvalues. Feynman’s work still uses the basic principles of quantum mechanics, but it was a large departure from the then existent archetypes because it wasn’t really concerned with energy spectra. Rather it was concerned with particle trajectories. Feynman’s solution for the path integral of the simple harmonic oscillator, or even the path integral itself added a new archetype to quantum mechanics and this archetype was developed by tasking the principles of the subject with answering a new question. 

Understanding this, the hope is that I can “free” myself from the hegemonic rule of current QFT archetypes—much like I freed myself of dissonant research practices—and find new questions and archetypes for QFT.

Structure of physics part II

(considers how physicists learn and do physics and what history tells us about how physical disciplines/fields develop and extend)


(The Role of Archetypes) 
-Archetypes in Physics: how do archetypes function in physics; what are the common physics archetypes
-Hierarchy of theory development: levels of theoretical development
	-first order, second order, and so on

(How new fields of Theoretical Physics develop) (How theoretical physics develops)
-Starting New Fields: new fields and new questions/new fields develop by asking specific and concrete questions about new physical situations. (generally not from abstract theorizing/pontificating about new disciplines)
	-topology and euler’s bridge
	-Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-tsinghuo/Lorenz system and chaos
	-string theory and poles of strong interactions
	-renormalization and Bethe lamb shift
	-chaos and Poincare’s three body problem
	-cosmology and Einstein?
(counter examples? Fields developed through abstracting rather than through problem solution? Relativity (both special and general? quantum mechanics? It seems foundational subjects are often/typically developed by positing principles/ideas and then using said principles to solve a specific problem) 


(Techniques/Formalisms through Questions)
	- Building techniques through questions: It is sometimes possible to build new techniques in a physical discipline/field/subject by trying to answer pursue a novel question. The process is 1) Have a main question and 2) in pursuing this main question develop subsidiary questions whose answers lead to new mathematical techniques. These techniques are shown to have a relevance beyond the main question you originally pursued. 
	Examples (all from quantum mechanics strangely):
	John Bell, Bell’s Inequalities
	Hellman-Feynman theorem and the forces on molecules
	Feynman path integral and renormalization problems in qft
	Renormalization and modeling the Lamb Shift
	Born-Oppenheimer approximation and describing atoms and molecules
	
	The result is even if the main question is not definitively answered (as in the case of Feynman’s Path Integral), the techniques/formalism developed in pursuit of the answer is still useful beyond the context for which it was developed. 


(July 19, 2017) - Revised Outline
— Hierarchical Structure of Theories: The division we made between principles mathematics and predictions can be further fine grained by looking at what types of ideas/techniques/formalisms exist between a theories principles and its predictions 

(For Foundational Subject) (Similar lists of archetypes/techniques/auxiliary ideas can be made for research subjects, except for research subject the principles exist in the foundational domains of physics)
Principles

Quantum Mech
Stat Phys and Thermo
Electrodynamics
Relativity

Learning a subject in physics often consists of learning about the basic archetypes of the subject. These archetypes serve as the models upon which other models specifically and our comprehension of the physical world more generally are based. A a level epistemically subordinate to archetypes are the mathematical techniques and the auxiliary ideas which frame them and allow us to move from the archetypes to predictions. 

Questions: In each physics discipline there are several overarching questions and many more subsidiary questions which frame the formalism of discipline and the archetypal systems the discipline studies.
Class Mech: What is the differential equation defining a physical system? What are the solutions to differential equations for linear and rotational systems? 
Quantum Physics: What are the energy spectra and eigenstates of a quantum system? How does the system evolve in time?
Statistical Physics: What are the thermal properties of a system at thermodynamic equilibrium?


Archetypes/Canonical Models: Model/Canonical system to motivate applying principles to understand the physical world. They are the standard models which bring us closer to reality. 
Class Mech: SHO, Central Force Motion
Quantum Physics: Hydrogen Atom, Infinite Square Well, Two State System, Phi^4 Field Theory, Calculation of $\alpha/2\pi$ 
Stat Phys and Thermo: Ideal Gas, Ising Model, Carnot Engine, Quantum Ideal Gas, XY Model
Electrodynamics: Field of a spherical object, Radiating dipole, Liénard–Wiechert potentials 
Relativity: Twin Paradox, Precession of Mercury, Schwarzschild Metric, Black Hole, Collapse of Dust Cloud

Within archetypes (or needed to investigate archetypes are two types of knowledge/epistemological stuffs of the overarching theory)

Techniques: The mathematics of the theory geared/tailored specifically toward elucidating the properties of the archetypes. (Things which would appear in an applied mathematics course but not in a pure mathematics course)
Class Mech: Perturbation Theory, Variational Principle,

The questions a discipline seeks to answer determine the archetypal systems which provide concrete questions for answering those questions, and attempts to explore these archetypal systems leads to new mathematical techniques extrapolated from the mathematical formalism of the theory in additional to auxiliary ideas which form the vocabulary used to understand the archetype and the discipline itself.

How Physics Develops

— Building New Techniques/Analytic Technology: New techniques/analytic technology/formalisms in physics often develop when physicists try to apply an existing formalism to answer a new question. The nature of the new question determines requires an extrapolation from existing methodology to something which could encompass the new question. 

— Seeking New Questions/Creating New Disciplines/Creating New Sub-Disciplines/Creating New Research Areas: One way that physicists/scientists determine which questions to ask (questions which lead them out of an existing formalism and toward a new formalism), is by asking a specific/concrete question about a physical system. (This specific/concrete question is one which has never been asked before, but it is believed (incorrectly) that existing formalisms can answer it)
(This is the same as how new fields of physics develop)

Notes for My Teaching

July 16, 2017 — Sunday 9:58 PM
Brainstormed Lessons from Teaching
You have to run before you can walk (You can’t just give students overly difficult problems)
How do you teach students abstraction/pattern recognition?
Importance of problems: (How does this change the way you will learn?) Difficult problems/types of problems/archetypal problems/long calculations/projects/papers
Writing lecture notes is frustrating, tiring, and time consuming and you should avoid it (100 pages of notes from May 16 - July 16)
Starter problems are a good idea
Thoughts on question problems? College students did not like it. High school students were OK with it
Having people watch your lectures and give feedback is a good idea
Group exam portions are great
Students like breaks in the middle of class
Students like applications
Students like demonstrations

So the summer of MITES 2017 is largely over and now is the time to consolidate my observations for posterity. Hopefully by reviewing these lessons I can become a better teacher and not inflict on my future pupils the maladaptive practices this group of guinea pigs had to endure. 

You have to run before you can walk

Over the summer, I eventually realized that the problems I had expected the students to be able to solve and the problems they were actually able to solve existed in two non-overlapping spaces. To bring the students somewhere close to where I wanted them to be I had to relax my attachment to what I wanted to teach and meet the students where they were. By the final exam, this basically amounted to me not expecting the students to make the multiple independent steps of deduction required of realistic problems, but rather providing the instruction-manual type problems I so previously disparaged. 

The source of this clash between expectation and reality was that although my homework problems were not of the instruction-manual variety and certainly required the students to make multiple steps of logic deduction, these steps were not “independent” because they were done largely in collaboration with other students or through discussions with me. Thus, students did not have many opportunities to practice by themselves the thought processes needed to solve problems in which the steps were not laid out for them. 

I know that this is largely my fault, but I have no idea how to correct it. Perhaps I should have started with instruction-manual type problems, and then deliberately removed structure as the course went on. But then again this is difficult to do as you introduce new material: New material would likely need to be practiced using the instruction-manual approach and so even later in the course, you would have students solving very well-defined problems on the new material. Perhaps a medley could work? Assign problems from the beginning of the course until now, and have the problems based on earlier material be less well-defined than the problems based on later material? But then over the course of a semester with 60 problems on an assignment, most of the problems would be from the earlier part of the course. How would you justify leaving out practice (even if only through well-defined problems) of newer material, so that students could practice thinking skills which could only be conveyed through old material? The students also have a sense of what material they should be learning, so if you leave out something important (even for good philosophical reasons) you might have something like a mutiny on your hands. 

The only takeaway I have is a better formulation of the problem:

You are trying to get students to the point where they are solving less-defined problems, but you first have to instruct them in solving well-defined problems. How can an instructor move from the latter to the former in a course where new material is constantly being introduced and that new material is best practiced (at least at the start) through well-defined problems?

Abstraction and Pattern Recognition 

Kuhn claims (correctly, I think) that much of physics research consists of investigators using the paradigmatic problems of the discipline to solve problems they had never seen before. By extrapolating the methods of these problems to new contexts, investigators naturally reach boundaries of existing knowledge and can thus better frame the questions which would lead to new theories. Being able to look at a problem and 

This is something so natural to physics education that I presumed it was not anything students had to learn. Of course you had to teach them the details of these canonical problems and make sure they did not commit to memory common misconceptions, but I had tacitly believed that students would do the rest and use these problem contexts flexibly to answer new question. 

Not so. Take, for instance, the calculation of normal modes for coupled oscillators. Although I went through an example in the notes and assigned a problem for a problem set—the latter of which all students worked through themselves—students were still confused as to what normal mode frequencies were and how to calculate them from the equation of motion of coupled oscillators. Take, for example, “the golden ratio” coupled oscillator problem I assigned for the last pset. After writing the equation of motion in matrix form, the students recognized they had to compute the eigenvalues of a matrix, but after I asked them what these eigenvalues represented, some of them said the “normal mode” or the “normal mode frequency” (The correct answer is the imaginary part of the square root of the eigenvalues represents the normal mode frequency). 

This was really the most basic example of students learning something in one context and being unable to apply it in a different (but arguably very similar) context. In another case, I gave students a non-quadratic potential energy function and I asked them to determine certain properties of the function near an equilibrium (something they had done in a previous problem).  Specifically, I said if a mass m begins at rest a distance d from the equilibrium, how would the initial energy of the mass change if we took A, a parameter in the potential energy, to 2A. The students had not seen such a problem before, but they had dealt with converting non-quadratic potential energies into quadratic potential energies through Taylor expansions (which was the first step to solving this problem). However, none of the students did this. Instead of considering the given potential energy function, the students interpreted A as an amplitude and blindly used the formula E = 1/2 kA^2.

In short, for some reason the basic ideas and techniques of the problems they had solved were not being internalized. They were not learning how to abstract essential principles from a problem and apply these principles in new cases. They were not learning how to recognize the patterns of an approach and extend these patterns to build new approaches to a problem. They were not learning the things that I was trying so fervently to teach them. 

Now, I’m wondering if the issue is that for the problem set questions, Rene and I shepherded most of the students through the difficult steps of the problems. Consequently, the students did not have to struggle with the meaning behind the steps they were taking and only had to follow what Rene and I said they should do. Since the students didn’t have to interrogate the meaning of their calculations, they never internalized the meaning I said was there and thus could not independently apply the learned procedures in new contexts. I had previously recognized the basic problem of students not understanding what they were doing, and I thought I could correct it by requiring the students to qualitatively explain their work, but apparently this is insufficient or just not the correct approach. 

If this is indeed the issue, how could I fix it? Require the students to solve problems on their own? I have no idea how this would be managed outside of the vagaries of the students’ own inclinations toward independence. How about giving the students problems similar to what they had seen before? I like this solution even less than the problem itself. The main reason for all the new teaching practices I have introduced (e.g., assigning “generate question” problems, requiring students to explain their derivations, assigning less-defined problems) is to make students so intimately familiar with the course material that they are not bound by it, that they can take it and engage with situations they had not seen before. It would defeat the purpose of my instruction if I intentionally required the students to solve problems which were too similar to what they already knew (or apparently already knew) how to solve.

Again, the takeaway is only a better formulation of the problem:

How can you teach students to abstract the basic ideas and techniques of a problem to new contexts? How can you teach students to recognize patterns in existing solutions to problems and extend those patterns to new and different problems? 

What Problems to Solve? Students should solve medium and hard problems

I suppose this is a truism in physics: In order to “understand” the subject as deeply as possible, one must solve many problems. But what types of problems should students solve in order to make the most efficient use of their time? 

I claim that students should spend most of their time solving medium and hard problems, the former of which are pursued mostly in preparation for the latter. 

I define easy problems as as problems for which the student can work out the important steps in their head. A medium problem is one which is a non-trivial deviation from a well-known archetype, and although having a known method of solution, the details of the solution are sufficiently complicated that they need to be worked out on paper. A hard problem is one for which there is no straightforward archetype and for which the student has to use the principles/techniques of the subject to develop for him or herself a solution. (I admit this is a rough and not very well defined labeling of these problem types) It is perhaps evident why students don’t need to solve easy problems, but why they need to solve medium problems on the way to the harder problems which are perhaps most instructive deserves explanation. 

At one point, one student (David) complained that all the problems I was assigning were overly difficult and that they seemed to be the “three star” problems at the very end of the chapter exercises for standard physics textbooks. I agreed that the problems I was assigning were not easy, but I then explained that in a fixed period of time, solving difficult problems is pedagogically more useful than solving easier ones. And although I still think this is true, I think I now have a better sense of where David (and maybe many other students who didn’t speak up) were coming from. 

Hard problems are the most pedagogically useful because they require students to use the material they have learned in novel ways and/or they lead students to interrogate the structure of the subject and thus be better prepared to modify it to study systems not in the canonical text. (Some examples would probably be useful here). In short, they provide students with a significant stretch in their abilities. On the other hand, working through the solution of easy problems often does not reveal anything new to the solver, and thus easy problems do not stretch the learner’s skill or knowledge base. (Think of the most boring kinematics problem you’ve ever seen in introductory mechanics.) They exist more as time sinks rather than time investments whose rewards are represented by the increased

So the ultimate goal is to get students working on the most pedagogically useful hard problems, but on the path towards solving such problems, it is useful for students to “cut their teeth” or “get their bearings” by working through medium problems. Working through such problems can still stretch, or at least solidify, student abilities and would consequently serve as good practice in the skills and techniques they should know well before encountering the harder problems. 

I am continually recognizing the truth of this as I work through Spivak’s Calculus on Manifolds. I always try to find the problems I have no idea how to solve (i.e., the hard problems), but before I approach them I try to work through some problems I am more comfortable with in order to become familiar with the new notation/theorem/etc..

As a caveat, what problems are experienced as “easy to solve” is of course relative. This was really the source of my dissonance with David. I did not think the problems I assigned were incredibly difficult, but it seems many (although not all) of the students thought otherwise. In a classroom full of students, you will have a large spectrum of levels of comfort with the prerequisites or the less defined “ways of thinking” for the subject, and so it’s inevitable that some students will find your medium problems easy and other students will find them hard. So perhaps this dissonance cannot be helped. In retrospect, I probably would change anything about the difficulty of the problems. 


Takeaway: In short, include both medium problems and hard problems in your assignments or in your own learning. Use the medium problems to build familiarity and comfort with the new material, and then use hard exercises to move deeper into the theoretical infrastructure or move wider and develop new branches in which the material can be applied. Generally stay away from easy problems. (See intro above for definitions of each type of problem)

Daily Dutiful Work is Necessary for Learning

I wonder if years from now I will remember the story of Joriam. I’ll present a summary of the details. Joriam came into my class with one of the highest scores on the physics diagnostic. Thus the first problem set I assigned, which covered basic kinematics and algebra, would have been well within his comfort zone. However, he completed just 3/4s of the first problem and wrote a note saying that he was sorry he couldn’t finish the assignment, but he hopes to do better next time since “MITES is all about the delta”. (Here he is referring to one of the stated precepts of the program in which improvement is, supposedly, valued over absolute performance.) However, on the next assignment, substantially longer and more difficult than the first, he did not do better. He again only turned in much less than half of the assignment. Recognizing a pattern I spoke to him about the issue. He said he was finding it hard to manage his time in the program, but will hopefully do better on the next assignment. And indeed he did. For the third assignment, which was about as short as the first assignment,  Joriam received a nearly perfect score. But for thereafter, he reverted to his previous low performance: He completed less than half of the fourth assignment, and didn’t turn in the fifth assignment. In the end he got one of the lowest scores on the exam. 

Rene (the TA for the class) later told me that Joriam said his plan had been to try to game the MITES delta system. Apparently Joriam had decided to underperform in the earlier weeks of the program so that his later excellent performance would seem all the more stellar to instructors and staff. But as the weeks went on, and as he didn’t complete assignments, he fell behind in the class and couldn’t catch up so that his intentional underperformance transformed into an unavoidable underperformance. 

It seems one’s students really can teach one things. Now before I rush to the lesson of this story, I should tread carefully because I have not had an extensive conversation with Joriam about these events (maybe I should?), so I do not know exactly what his thought process was in deciding to implement his plan. Maybe he was just not interested in the class and told himself he was intentionally underperforming when in fact, he was just performing at the level that his interest dictated. But interpreting the story transparently, if I’m allowed to assume that Joriam’s was a simple mistake of overconfidence, the lesson I abstract from it is that regardless of how capable you think you are, you really need to put in daily and dutiful work to learn something new. (Now maybe this isn’t always true. Maybe you can coast through learning somethings, but certainly not all things.) Joriam certainly came into my class with a more solid knowledge of the prerequisites than other students. However, he also seemed to be well aware of this fact, and I think this made him believe this class would be easier than it was or that it would require a similar level of engagement (or, rather, non-engagement) that his other physics classes required. So, he never put in the daily work which would have allowed him to build not only the knowledge but also the habits of thinking which were needed later in the course. 

I’m currently applying Joriam’s lesson to my own work. I’m trying to learn Yorùbá and something about Calculus on Manifolds, and I’m spending 45 minutes a day on each because I now know (or again know?) that there really is no substantially different way to learn a new subject. 


Takeaway: When learning something new, you need to study the subject daily and dutifully. Having a definite but easy to implement structure helps. Example: Allot 45 minutes a day to the new subject at first, and then see if you can do this for 20 consecutive days (or four consecutive weeks with weekend breaks).

Critical Engagement through Writing: Necessary but not Sufficient

So this summer I implemented my master plan of turning physics students into physics experts by requiring them to explain both in words and in equations their solutions to assigned problems. My motivation comes all the way from my experience as a grader at MIT. Back then I found that students, not required to connect their symbols to anything resembling physical reality, often wrote down most the unrigorous and physically inconsistent mathematical explanations of a problem. If anyone has any doubt about how mathematics, far from being the paragon discipline of clear and cogent reasoning, could be twisted to fit whatever half-quantitative purpose the user desires, I urge you to become a grader in the MIT physics department. 

My other source of motivation comes from my first TA position in 2010. During preparation for a midterm, a student (Hillary I think?) asked me what was the formula for the kinetic energy of a particle. This question came weeks after we used this formula and its various manifestations in relativity, statistical mechanics, and classical mechanics. I would have surely thought that by now, although students wouldn’t be absolutely solid on the more advanced subjects, they would all at least know what the formula for kinetic energy was. Later I guessed that the problem was the course was 1) covering too much material (something that I too am possibly guilty of this summer) and 2) not forcing students to engage critically with the formulas they were using. The first problem could (theoretically) be fixed by course restructuring. And I believed the second problem could be fixed by having students explain in words all the manipulations they were doing in their assignments.

Summarily, I figured that if students had to explain their solutions in words, I would both avoid mathematical nonsense and lead students into a deeper understanding of the material their learning. To be fair, I think I did achieve the first goal this summer: I do not remember seeing any egregious mathematical manipulations in student problem sets (although I was not the grader for the course, and so only skimmed most of the assignments.) But I did not achieve the second. In the review session for the final exam, I had to extract (seemingly under duress) from the students an explanation of how to solve the simple harmonic oscillator equation. Ife also once admitted to me while we were doing a coupled oscillator problem that she had no idea how to determine which terms to include in the net-force for each oscillator. Apparently the students had been parroting my explanations and copying my derivations, but not truly understanding the content of either. 

Takeaway: 
So, having students explain solutions in words is maybe not the answer. (Although, perhaps if I was grading these assignments myself I would have picked up on gaps in student understanding earlier.) What is an alternative? Have students explain why they are taking the steps they’re taking? Wouldn’t this just lead to them parroting my “why” instead of developing an understanding on their own?

Need a Variety of Problems

This summer, I incorporated two new problem types into the curriculum: Computational/Programming problems and “What is the question?” problems. The programming problem types were used to give students an introduction to using programming to answer scientific questions and to provide an unfamiliar context in which to study the difficult concepts of the class. I felt, introducing students to an unfamiliar context was important to widen their sense of how the techniques they were learning could be applied. 

The “What is the question?” problems were used to get students practicing asking and answering their own questions. The ultimate goal, which I do not know if I achieved, was to get students to incorporate such self-questioning/self-answering into their own work, so that they are less dependent on me (and other authority figures) for their education. It was difficult incorporating this type of problem into every assignment, because some assignments were focused on mostly technical matters about which I could not envision scenarios leading to nontrivial questions. So I didn’t include “What is the question?” problems in the assignments focusing on coupled oscillations and Fourier Series. I had run into a basic (and valid) objection to these type of questions: They are not the best methods for inculcating students in the technical details of a technique, even if they are ultimately the kinds of problems we want students to be able to solve. 

I need more types of problems I can incorporate into an assignment. Specifically, I need problems which can probe students understanding of auxiliary ideas and the reasons various steps are taken in a derivation. For both the former and the latter objective, I can revive and revamp the “Where is the error (if anywhere)?” questions. To probe auxiliary ideas, I can have a mostly qualitative discussion between two people where one proposes something incorrect about an auxiliary idea and the other gives a rebuttal. The student would then have to determine who is correct and why. To teach students “the why” for various parts of a derivation, I can include a short or medium length derivation in the assignment and have students write out a bullet point explaining two things: 1) where (if anywhere) there is an error in the derivation and 2) why each step of the derivation was taken. 

For both types of questions, you can likely get material from common student misconceptions or technical mistakes. For example, during the summer many students were confused about what the difference between normal modes and normal mode frequencies were, so you could have a conversation where one person says a normal mode frequency is a normal mode and the other person disagrees. 

Takeaway:
To probe students understanding of auxiliary ideas and derivations, assign “Where is the error (if anywhere)?” questions. Questions focused on ideas will be mostly qualitative discussions between two people, and questions focused on derivations will include semi-long calculations which students will have to analyze for errors and for the reasons each step was taken.

Teaching and Self-Education

I think it is fair to say, you understand the (admittedly very basic) canon of waves and vibrations, much better now that you have taught the subject. This isn’t too surprising. Having to teach a subject to a group of high school students who haven’t yet acquired the habit of gliding over derivation or logical gaps forces you to constantly ask yourself whether what you think you understand makes sense. This requirement, for me, was meted out in how I composed the lecture notes. I tried to present the subject logically (or as logically as possible for a subject founded upon unprovable premises) and always asked myself whether someone who did not already know the answer I was building up to would accept the steps I was taking. I was not always faithful to this responsibility (e.g., I gave virtually no explanation for the form of the critically damped oscillator solution), but having it in the back of my mind made my explanations more solid and more careful. For example, I now have a better understanding of wave reflection and transmission than I ever have.

The point is teaching a subject can contribute to your own education in that subject. Moreover, the habit of trying to look at a subject from the perspective of a beginner is an excellent one to have, and would make you less likely to lazily accept the dogma and standard ways of understanding and applying a discipline. And beyond just teaching the subject, having a collection of self-written lecture notes on the subject provides a good reference for your own understanding of the subject. However, writing these lecture notes is incredibly time consuming especially for slow writers. From May 16 to June 16, I wrote about 100 pages of lecture notes (not including problem sets, exams, and their solutions) and this was all for a subject I apparently knew well. 

Takeaway:
Teaching a subject alerts you to gaps in your own understanding, and develops the habit of asking basic (but crucial) questions about the assumptions the subject makes in derivations or  in its foundations. Questions like: “Would a student accept this derivation?” “What questions would a student have about the assumptions I’m making?” Moreover, writing lecture notes (as though you were to teach the subject) gives you useful reference for your personal understanding of the subject.

Preparing for Evaluations

After the end of the program, I finished writing evaluations for all of my 15 students over the course of five days. This was rather quick considering that we were given until August 31 to submit these evaluations, but the writing was often trying. I didn’t get to know all the students very well, so I did not always have something substantial to say about their characters or abilities. For the students for whom I could not think of saying anything, I ended up cobbling together vague statements concerning how their problem set scores and exam scores have improved throughout the course. If the students exam scores had not improved I focused on their interest in physics or their effort in the course. It was dispiriting to be able to say so little about students I had spent 100+ hours with. For some reason, I did not anticipate this dearth of material and so did not make a huge effort during the course to get to know all the students. Indeed the students that I knew the most about were the ones who spent time getting to know me. 

If I ever teach this course again, I will need to create more scenarios in which I can informally engage with the students. Things like lunch OH (which I eliminated because students were mostly using it to hang out), in-class problem solving sessions, evening dinners, and informal pow-wows would be useful for this end. (For the lunch OH, you can make them less noisy and feel like less of a waste of time, if you enforce some rules from the beginning. (e.g., no playing loud music, use the office hours to work, go elsewhere if you want to relax before class)

Takeaway:
In preparation for writing evaluations, you should create more opportunities to talk informally with the students. Possible opportunities
-long office hours (like four hour sessions on Monday)
-lunch office hours
-evening dinners: good for getting to know the students personal background and academic interests
-informal pow-wows where the students get to ask me questions: good for getting to know what students care about knowing from you
-in-class problem solving sessions: good for getting to know how students think in real time. 


Lessons Learned About Teaching
- Physics III for MITES 2017 is the first course I taught on my own. It was challenging for a number of reasons which had nothing (or little) to do with my own failures: The course was at MIT and thus I had to manage my time better in scheduling transport to class (Didn’t always work. I was late to the midterm for example); I was writing lecture notes, problem sets, exams, starter problems, and solutions as the course was going on and thus it proved difficult to work on anything else during the summer. 

But aside from choosing a place to teach that is near my own office, and composing course material well in advance of the start of class, there are some more content/structure specific lessons I’ve learned from this experience. 

Starter Problems: Having the students complete an ungraded 5 minute warmup problem is excellent for two reasons. It gets the students thinking at the start of class, and it allows you to track their understanding of the course material. 

Break in the middle of class: Students really like a five minute break in the middle of class. This allows the sleepy ones to get up, stretch, and formulate a plan for how they will stay up for the remaining half of the class. 

“What is the question?” problems require more thought: Your “What is the question?” problems were good but they were kind of scattered. You want the students to build up to being able to analyze more and more complicated systems. You should also really find a way to include such questions on each assignment. 

Group Exam Portions are great: For in class exams, group exam portions are great as they give students an arena to practice discussing solutions without your help. I think having the group exam be different from the individual exam is better than just having a duplicate individual exam. This gives you more flexibility in choosing problems that are solvable in the time you allot for the group exam. 


Having people watch your lectures leads to good feedback: I’m glad I let Jiwon sit in on two of my classes. The first class was a standard lecture and the second one was a problem solving session and she gave me good feedback for both. Jiwon is an education researcher so she probably has a better eye for good teaching practices than other people do, but likely having anyone sit in on the lecture and then later give me comments on went well/not so well would be beneficial. 


Students like applications: I think the material of the class was too theoretical. I was too focused on building up the subject logically from Newton’s laws that I didn’t consider that the thing students likely most hungered for was seeing how the material was relevant to a world they could see and touch. Thus, having more applications (in the problem sets and the lectures) would likely make students more engaged. 


Students like demonstrations: You had no demonstrations in this class! The one quasi-demonstration of beat phenomena was incredible simple but the student response was so positive it became clear that I should have incorporated real demonstrations from the beginning. Doing so would require some prior planning that I did not have (or make?) the time to complete. So together with the next point, I should try to find a way to incorporate one demonstration into the class per week. 


Write your course content before the course begins: I know you tried to do this, and the overlap between finishing Phys143a material and the start of MITES was such that you couldn’t completely finish all the lecture notes you’re wanted. Still it was an admirable and intelligent goal you should try to achieve whenever you teach a course. 


Menage Problem: https://math.dartmouth.edu/~doyle/docs/menage/menage/menage.html

July 27, 2017 — Thursday 9:58 PM
Experimental Realization of Favorable Contact Model

Today I had a useful meeting with Eugene (the post-doc). Days ago I had asked him to look through a one-page summary on the favorable contact model. The summary consisted of a description of the assumptions which went into the model and a short list of experimental observables I could calculate. The point of these descriptions was to find the bare features of the model which could be mapped onto some as of yet unknown experimental situation. Eugene previously provided excellent suggestions concerning this model so I felt it would be most useful to ask him about it. 

He mentioned three experimental situations in increasing order of difficulty of implementation in which to test the model: 1) single-stranded DNA binding; 2) DNA to transcription factor (or to some other DNA binding protein) binding; 3) transcription factor to transcription factor (or protein to protein binding). 

We spent most of the meeting talking about single-stranded DNA binding and how one could test the various aspects of the model. He stated single-stranded DNA studies would be the simplest to implement because there are companies which engineer short N-mer DNA sequences which would have “favorable” pairing with their complementary strands. The energy of interaction between contacts could be discerned by finding the melting temperature of the contacts and then determining the “Delta G”. (This is somewhat troubling to me because the free energy “G” certainly represents something specific in thermodynamics whereas my model defines the contacts by energy “E”). One, could determine how many favorable contacts there are by attaching fluorophore “lock” and “keys” to the 5’ end of one strand and the 3’ end of the complementary strand so that the fluorophore is only “turned on/activated” when the favorable contact exists. I am not sure how one would engineer the fluorophores so specifically that their is only a single lock and single key for each strand-complement pair. Assuming all this works out, we could then create a curve of brightness versus temperature which would reveal how many favorable contacts exist as a function of temperature. From this curve, we could determine whether the favorable contact model correctly predicts a transition temperature (Or use the curve to reverse determine the energy cost of unfavorable contact and thereby check consistency with the energy cost found from the melting curve). 

Eugene mentioned one of his former semi-advisors from MIT (Ibrahim Cisse) did his Ph. D work on single stranded DNA. I should look up this guy’s work. 

With regard to DNA transcription factor binding he mentioned something having to do with “Zinc finger” a term I have never heard of before. But this experimental situation is not really the favorable contact model. It is rather the “gendered” favorable contact model or simply the permutation model I originally studied. 

All of these studies, by the way would be in vitro. Eugene did mention one in vivo application: Something called the Pho P and Pho Q signaling system. One problem with such an application is that I would lose the ability to tune temperature because such tuning would likely kill the cell :(.

For the transcription factor to transcription factor binding, Eugene mentioned Amy Keating works on this at MIT. 

OK, Task List
Find more information about DNA single-stranded studies
Can we determine the melting temperature and the Delta G for such single strands
If we have a collection of these strands where each strand only has a favorable contact with one other strand, will the strands still exist in pairs at most relevant temperatures? (This perhaps is a question of whether the thermal energy fluctuations are greater than or less than the Delta G)
Could we devise a system where there is a fixed energy cost for each unfavorable contact?
How would I purchase these DNA strands?
What experimental apparatus/setup do I need?
How would one attach fluorophores with such specificity that they only turn on when their is a favorable contact?
Does the length of the DNA strands matter? 
How different can the strands be from one another? (Or how many base pairs need to differ between strands in order for this scenario to work?)

She is Leaving
I have been trying to imagine what my life will be like when Amy is gone. In some moments late in the office I feel the future pulling on me, giving me a preview of how it will manifest itself in a month’s time. If I were to return to my room without her prospective visit to bolster me through the night, how would that night be spent? Today Amy is out with her roommate Cristina, and I have the opportunity to simulate the nights to come. What do I feel? Silence, certainly, but it is not the silence of dawn, but rather the silence of the ocean: awesome, desolate, breathtaking in its apparent endlessness, and most of all, lonely. And I, of all people, know loneliness. It was my first (and may be my last) intimate relationship with some metaphysical force on this planet. I knew it before and I will know it again, but with Amy I could pretend it to be safely in the past. I do not know what I will become when she is gone, but I hope I will not shame myself through histrionics, through futile attempts to fill whatever Amy-shaped hole she leaves behind.

Mathematics and the Unexpected, Ivar Ekeland
“But Copernicus, and all astronomers up to the time of Kepler, did not see the problem as it was: they saw it through the eyes of their predecessors. The circle, and circular motion, were too firmly ingrained in their minds by years of training, and had shown themselves too successful in the past. There as no room left for any alternative. The question was no longer how to describe planetary movements, using what ever mathematical tools were available, but rather how to approximate planetary movements by sophisticated combinations of circular movements. By setting the problem in this way, the astronomers were unwittingly depriving themselves of any possibility of finding its true solution, the elliptical orbit. They had drawn a magic circle around themselves, and were searching inside the circle for something that simply wasn’t there. Kepler’s genius was to break the circle and reach for available tools that were lying around unused.” pg. 8


What is it about the daily grind of science which leads researchers to so often substitute study of a phenomena with study of the intricacies of the models used to represent that phenomena. I imagine if one were working in the time of Copernicus as some analog of today’s graduate student one would complete a thesis where circles and epicycles would be used to model the motion of Jupiter or one of its satellites. The student would be judged on his or her (most likely “his”) adherence to the technical structure of the existing formalism. Students departing from this formalism would probably be judged negatively. 

Perhaps it’s something other than a tendency to substitute models for phenomena. Perhaps it has more to do with some tendency to become enamored by technical formalism. I remember talking to one professor at Johns Hopkins who told me that he tended not to to get too attached to specific techniques apart from the questions they sought to answer. I think this is the correct approach although it is often difficult to achieve in practice because the way students are trained in science leads them to conflate the formalism of a subject with the larger question the subject seeks to answer. Indeed an alternative to this way of “doing science” may not be possible since the question itself is often framed using the language (and hence the assumptions) of the subject. It is like someone trying to think outside a box when the “box” is the only thing that allows them to formulate thought itself. 

[//]

“. . .in September 1846, Le Verrier was able to write to a colleague in Berlin, asking him to look at some particular spot in the sky. Sure enough, Neptune was there. An astronomer had discovered a new planet without even raising his head. 
	It was a tremendous success. Failure followed some years later, when Le Verrier applied the same methods to the irregularities in the motion of Mercury and announced the discovery of a new planet, Vulcan, which never showed up. Nowadays, we know these irregularities come from general relativity. . .” pg 19 


I am reminded of particle physicists efforts to explain dark matter with new particles. Given the past success of the particle-paradigm (the prediction of the neutrino, various nuclear particles, the W/Z boson, the higgs boson) it makes perfect sense to think that any new matter not understood through the existing particle content could be understood by postulating a new particle. But isn’t this what Le Verrier was doing here? Given the past success of Newtonian gravitation in describing the orbits of planets and in even predicting the existence of a new one, it is perfectly reasonable to see any orbits deviating from the newtonian prediction as evidence of an undiscovered planet. The fact that Le Verrier was wrong should be troubling to any particle theorists who ascribe a particle interpretation to Dark Matter. 

[//]

“They even predicted the future of their own science. Here are the tasks which Laplace set for astronomers of later centuries: to register stars and nebulae, with their movements and shapes, and their variations: to find new objects in the solar system, mainly comets, and their orbits. There is nothing else left for them to do, since all interesting things have already been done. As Lagrange put it, ‘since there is but a single universe to explain, no one can redo what Newton did, happiest of mortals.’ ” pg. 18 

What of course follows this is General Relativity and 100 years of cosmology and gravitation in which we discovered that our universe was expanding, the collapse of stars, and gravitational waves emitted from orbiting black holes. 

What gives scientists the hubris to make pronouncements like these? I ask this question half rhetorically, because I know the answer. It’s past successes (or perceived successes) understanding physical phenomena which seduces scientists into believing they understand the world. The way many physicists feel about string theory (namely that it is correct even though it has not been experimentally tested) suggests that this “understanding” need not have an experimental foundation. Indeed it could be defined along lines of theoretical consistency and the vagaries of beauty. History,  however, suggests we should be deeply suspicious of such pronouncements as they are more indicative of how we have taught ourself to see the world rather than of the best ways of seeing the world. 

“In science, as everywhere else, there are few true creators, people able to leave the beaten track and to come up with new ideas. It is very tempting to deem a problem interesting because half the people you know are working on it. But truly deep and difficult promise no easy returns, and do not attract people eager to publish.” - pg 25

This is a question I have always struggled with: How to do science in a way which is personally fulfilling, but also externally impacting. More specifically, because I am not really a scientist, the question is how to do physics and mathematics in this seemingly dichotomous fashion. The answer that I’ve meandered to is to ignore the latter and focus on the former. For me at least, physics and mathematics are sufficiently difficult in and of themselves that it is next to impossible to balance one’s own interest against the interest of others. Years ago when I looked through the list of PhD theses at Harvard I was dismayed to find that so many works year after year seemed to be on essentially identical topics. It was as if students were choosing topics based on current trends in the research literature and not based on whatever divergent interests they entered graduate school with. I later realized that the true source of this convergence were the Ph.D advisors: graduate students, year after year, have similar dissertations because they get their projects from their advisors who parcel out various aspects of a large investigation to their students. 

Back then I had made the tacit decision—more realistically an abject hope—to not become one of these students, to not become someone who simply reflects the seemingly most attractive and popular aspects of my environment, but rather someone who looks concertedly at where he is and then chooses where he will go next. This I recognize is partly a dream, as we are all influenced to some extent by the contexts we find ourselves in. But I also recognize this is partly the key to leaving the “so called” beaten track and “coming up with new ideas.” Rather than thoughtlessly believing that the world will help you to achieve your identity, you have to decide who you are and begin taking responsibility for that decision. It is the weight of that responsibility which will make the balance of easy versus difficult returns easier to arbitrate.

What does it mean to understand? (In Physics or in Science)

(Three questions)
We want to explore what it means to “understand” something. There are three scenarios and associated questions which specify more precisely this exploration: 

— You are teaching a subject: How do you know when your students have achieved what it means “to understand” the subject?

— You are learning a subject: How do you know when you have achieved what it means “to understand” the subject?

— You are studying physical phenomena: How do you know when you understand the phenomena? 

These questions are related but not identical. Consider the last two questions. John Couch Adam’s predictions about the location and existence of Neptune imply that he understood Newtonian mechanics itself, but, given that he did not know relativity, would it be correct to say that he understood the phenomenon of “gravitation”? Or, more precisely, would it be correct to say that Adams understood “gravitation” as well as, say, an undergraduate who just completed a course in general relativity? Thus, merely understanding a subject does not directly imply that one understands the phenomena the subject seeks to model. 

The first and the second question are somewhat similar since, presuming the equal accessibility of various ways of understanding, one could imagine that the standards one uses to determine whether another person understands a subject would be identical to the standards used to determine whether oneself understands a subject. However, the first question concerns an external probing of understanding while the second question concerns an internal one. (Is this really an important difference? I am not convinced that these two questions will have significantly different answers)

In a way I am looking for what X and Y are in the following statement: When you able to do X, then you understand the subject. When you are able to do Y, then you understand the physical phenomena. 

(Why does it matter?)
Why is this question important? or Why do the answers to this question matter? The first and second question matter for physics education. If we are trying to develop understanding in our students (or in our selves during our own work) we should know what goal we’re striving towards (i.e., we should know what we want our students to be able to do) and we should interrogate why that goal is the correct one. (What level an type of understanding should we seek in ourselves and our students) The third question, although seemingly philosophical, has practical importance for science at large. The reproducibility crisis in psychology/social sciences  reveals that those communities’ senses of what it meant to understand an aspect of  psychological/social world was flawed. What new standards of understanding should be built in their place? Physical scientists are not off the hook either. Copernicus and many astronomers prior modeled the motion of the planets as circles on circles. We can now say they did not understand gravitation. At the time, they would they have not said the same thing, and what does the fact that they would not have said the same thing imply about the current state of physics? (Or Le Verrier who, although having used Newtonian gravity correctly predict the existence of Uranus, also used the theory incorrectly to predict the existence of a planet (termed “Vulcan”) inside Mercury’s orbit. We can now say that Le Verrier did not understand gravitation, partly evidenced by his wrong prediction, but why would he have not said the same thing and what does the fact that he would have said differently imply about our understanding of the physical world through current theories of physics?) 

(Specification of question)
(Should be in the conclusion)

My guess is that in both cases, what one means by “understand” is contingent upon/inextricable from what one intends to do with that understanding. In other words (beyond the breadth and specificity distinction), there is no such thing as absolute understanding because understanding is always measured/arbitrated/probed using a specific (if often unstated) metric which is not value neutral. 

Our sense of understanding in science (i.e., what we define as understanding of the natural world) extends from a technocratic value system in which one seeks to control nature. 

Our sense of understanding in science education extends from the use of science in professional contexts, namely in teaching, in daily research work, and in industry/business applications. This would explain why the way understanding is probed in most educational institutions is through tests which seek to measure how well students can apply the canonical techniques and ideas of a subject to new problems. These problems are often solvable by interpreting the subjects archetypal problems in a new context. 

(Attempts to Answer: For Science at large) 
For science, understanding of a phenomena seems to extend from 
-predictive power (i.e., ability to predict results of future experiments)
-observational consistency (i.e., a theory’s results fitting in with past and current observations)
-value-system consonance/coherence/adherence (i.e., the theoretical structure’s adherence to community values)

Even these criteria are not clear cut. How precise do these predictions need to be? Kepler rejected a mathematical model of orbits because it was off by 1/7 of a degree, we ultimately can say he was correct to do so but how do we know what level of precision is tolerable (Actually I think this is an easy question to answer, the predictions have to be as precise as what’s allowed for by experimental error.) What observations does the theory need to be consistent with? Newtonian gravity had consistency with some aspects of astronomy, but not all. And what value system is the appropriate one? In antiquity, astronomers valued circles as planetary orbits because of their geometric perfection. Prior to the 20th century, physicists believed in a clockwork universe in which probabilistic predictions were due to a lack of information. Currently, physicists certainly have some value system (maybe “reductionism”) which will only be revealed later as an epistemic block in the understanding some currently misunderstood phenomena. 

(Attempts to Answer: For subjects in science)

The question of whether someone understands a “subject” is perhaps too broad, because subjects themselves are quite broad. It would be easier to answer the question of whether someone understands a particular topic in a subject. This is the way educational institutions deal practically with the breadth problem: They define a few canonical subtopics or questions in a subject and understanding in the subject at large is inferred from understanding of the subtopics or questions. Thus, although it may be unwieldy to probe understanding of the compendium of classical mechanics, it would be much more tractable to probe understanding of center of mass or Newton’s second law.

- Some people say you don’t understand something unless you’re able to explain it to others. But it is perfectly possible to explain something incorrect from a subject-level perspective to another person. 

(Conclusions)
The question of whether we understand a physical phenomena is not a useful one, because inductive extrapolation of history suggests the answer is always “No”. Perhaps the question is a bad one because it’s answer presumes a dichotomy between understanding and not understanding, when in fact there is a large sea of grey. Although we could say we now understand more, the astronomers of antiquity certainly understood “something” about gravity. Thus, it is difficult to prove the existence of absolute understanding and easier to argue for the greater relative understanding of one out of two scenarios/situations/contexts/models. This question of whether humans have “absolute understanding” is arguably a hubristic one, that is one which is conflated with man’s sense of mastery over nature and extends from his need to have such a sense. 

One can answer the question of what it means to understand a subject, but even this answer does not cleanly separate understanding from lack of understanding. Would it be correct to say that Feynman did not understand the subject of quantum field theory circa. 1940, given that (if his claims are accurate) he could not understand Heitler’s book and had to develop on his own a formalism he could understand?


(Nov 15, 2017: Addendum) Our sense of what it means to understand something is largely dictated by the conventions we have unconsciously assimilated which define our current sense of understanding. The mathematicization of physics brought upon a new understanding of physical phenomena, one associated not merely with models but with mathematical models in particular and more specifically mathematical models with unifying and reductionist properties. (http://www.archipel.uqam.ca/443/1/gingras-mathematics.pdf)

(Dec 5, 2017: Addendum) Experience a new understanding is a felt sense which is categorized as “understanding" similarity to other moments of understanding.

Amy’s Brain Teasers
Yesterday Amy told me three brainteasers that a friend of hers was asked to solve for a programming interview. Below are the brainteasers along with my solutions and Amy’s commentary about the correct solution. 

(a) There are 100 empty seats on a plane and 100 people to fill them with each person having an assigned seat. The people enter the plane one-by-one. The first person to enter the plane chooses a random seat and sits down. Every person after the first person, sits down in his or her assigned seat if it is available. If it is not available, the person chooses a random seat and sits down. What is the probability that the last person is in his or her assigned seat?

(b) There is a 100 story building. You have two eggs and you want to determine the highest story from which you can drop the an egg without it breaking. If both your eggs break, it’s game over. What is best the procedure for determine this maximum height in the least number of trials. (This problem is rather theoretical given that an egg dropped from even a yard would break)

(c) There are 100 bottles of wine one of which contains poison. There are 10 distinguishable rats each of which can drink an unlimited number of wine bottles. If a rat drinks a poison bottle, it takes a day for the poison to take affect. How can you determine which bottle of wine contains poison?

(a) It’s possible to derive a recursion relation for this probability as a function of the number of seats/people. Say there are N seats and N people, and the probability that the last person gets his or her seat is p_N. There is a 1/N probability that the first person sits in any single seat which means there is a 1/N probability that said person sits in his or her own seat. If he sits in his own seat, then all subsequent passengers also sit in their own seats. Thus the first term defining p_N is 1/N. There is a 1/N probability that this first person sits in the second person’s seat, after which the problem becomes identical to that with N-1 seats and N-1 people (i.e., the second person sits in a random seat and so on). Thus the second term defining p_N is 1/N times p_(N-1). Similarly, if the first person sits in the third person’s seat, then the second person sits in his or her own seat, but then the third person chooses a random seat, and the last person sits in his/her own seat with probability p_(N-2). This term’s contribution to p_N would be 1/N p_N-2. Thus in all, we have 

p_N = 1/N + 1/N p_(N-1) + 1/N p_(N-2) + . . . + 1/N p_2. 

where p_2 is the probability that the second person sits in his or her own seat when there are only two seats and two people. The value of p_2 is 1/2. We can rewrite the above equation as 

N p_N = 1 + p_(N-1) + p_(N-2) + . . . +  p_2

Writing a similar equation for N-1 we have 

(N-1) p_(N-1_ = 1 + p_(N-2) + . . . + p_2. 

Subtracting the two equations ultimately leads to p_N = p_(N-1). Thus we find that p_N is independent of N for N >=2. Specifically, given the value of p_2, p_N = 1/2. 

Given the simplicity of this solution, I’m sure there is a more intuitive solution. Amy told me that this answer is correct as can be found from induction or test cases. 

(b) So as far as I can tell this problem doesn’t have a very clean solution. (Or it has a clean solution that I don’t know) The setup reminded me of a binary search problem: There is a list of numbers from 1 to 100. Someone thinks of a number within the domain (inclusive) and you ask yes/no question to determine the number. Specifically, you ask is the number higher than 50? higher than 75? higher than 67.5? and so on gradually reducing your interval of numbers by half each time you get an answer. For a set of numbers whose distribution properties you’re completely ignorant about, it is best to assume a uniform distribution and thus this “divide interval” by half procedure is the most efficient one. 

This was the solution I gave to Amy. Go up to the 50th floor and drop an egg. If it breaks you go to the 25th floor. If it breaks then you guess a number between 25 and 50. If it doesn’t you go to the 38th floor and drop the egg and so on. This way you’ll quickly move toward an estimate of the optimal floor. 

Amy said that this was a good strategy if one had infinite eggs and if one’s goal was to only get a ballpark estimate of the optimal floor in the least number of egg drops. But since one’s goal is to get the exact value of the optimal floor, the following procedure is better. Begin on the 50th floor and drop an egg. If it breaks begin on the first floor and drop the egg for increasing floors until it breaks. If it doesn’t break on the 50th floor, begin on the 51st floor and drop the egg for increasing floors until it breaks. 

(c) For this problem, I realized the goal is to develop a code written in the distinct rats which allows you to distinctly label 100 numbers. Given that there are 45 ways to choose two numbers out of a set of 10 and 120 ways to choose three numbers out of a set of ten, I reasoned that a three rate code system would work (Just like codons with 10 base pairs instead of four!). You let rats (1, 2, 3) drink the first bottle and let rats (1, 2, 4) drink the second bottle and rats (1, 2, 5) drink the third bottle and so on until each bottle has been drunk by a unique combination of three rats. You wait a day and the three rats which die will tell you which bottle contained the poison. 

Amy liked this solution. She said her friend’s solution was conceptually similar but it used a base 2 numbering system with ten digits. For example the first bottle would be 1000000000 which meant only the first rat would drink it and the second bottle would be 0100000000 which meant only the second rat would drink it and so on.

Especially because of the third point above, the academic system is extremely fragile and prone to be substantially distorted when under external pressure that influences researchers interests. It is for this reason that traditionally the ivory tower was meant to protect scientists. The ivory tower is now a word used quite cynically to describe the detached academic who doesn't know what people do in real life. But the intention of this detachment was to make scientists independent of financial, political, and social influence. This independence is crucial, and it is not easy to obtain. Rational and objective judgement is essential to science and is simple neither on the personal nor on the community level. The only way that researchers micro-interests can be as objective and well-informed as possible, and that these interests can lead to a desired outcome is to ensure researchers are able to follow their judgement on ideas, unaffected by what fashion,

Reading Notes 

Holton, The Advancement of Science and its Burdens, 1998

“We can turn again to Einstein’s remark, . . . , that ‘epsitemology without contact with science becomes an empty scheme. Science without epistemology is - in so far as it is thinkable at all - primitive and muddled.” pg. 164

-This quote presents the (previously) uncontroversial idea that science needs epistemology in order to become a clear and mature academic discipline. Perhaps the way epistemology forces scientist to take a self critical perspective on their own work makes it a useful tool in investigating the products and general aims of that work. I am less clear why epistemology needs science. Perhaps science, as the discipline which can have the greatest direct influence on human life, is itself a useful arena in which to determine the utility and methods of constructing knowledge. 

“This classical preparation is now dead . . .” 

-Interesting question: Do ‘serious’ scientists no longer engage critically with philosophy because serious science has evolved to the point of not requiring a self-critical philosophical appraisal for continual progress? Have scientists so ensconced themselves in highly technical pursuits that questions of philosophy are not relevant? Or are scientists ignoring the manifest ways their work is inextricably linked to philosophy? Or is it something else? 

“. . . an important paradox. For despite the decay of explicit allegiance to the scientific-philosophical tradition, science in our day is without doubt as powerful and interesting as it has ever been, both as a product and as a process.” pg. 165

-This is a plug for the first possibility: Maybe science does not need philosophy. But then again what do I mean by ‘need’?

“The implicit model for scientific progress is not solving a puzzle once and for all, but the emergence of tolerable solutions from which better problems will become available for future work.” pg. 168

-Essentially the idea that solving (or even partially solving) a single problem leads to many more problems. This was one of root-bernstein’s ideas I think. 

“. . . how can science be done so well without the conscious contact with epistemology that characterized the classical mode? 

-Science has lost contact with philosophy and yet it continues seemingly unimpeded. How? Holton claims a culture of measured irreverence for accepted (but not rationally required) beliefs has created scientists who are willing to produce and pursue research problems whose empirical justifications lie well into the future. Pursuing these programs (in spite of their current failure to satisfy popper’s definition of science) leads to developments which would have proceeded much more slowly had scientist exercised more restraint. 
Examples
-Glashow theory of weak interactions and massive vector bosons
-C.N. Yang and R. Mills theory of charged and massive gauge bosons 
-Glashow-Georgi theory of unified interactions: Quote from paper “Our hypothesis may be wrong and out speculations idle, but the uniqueness and simplicity of our scheme are reasons enough to be taken seriously.”

Poincaré, Science and Method

“If we read a book written 50 years ago, the greater part of the arguments appear to us devoid of exactness. 
	At that period, they assumed that a continuous fraction cannot change its sign without passing through zero, but today we prove it. They assumed that the ordinary rules of calculus are applicable to incommensurable [complex?] numbers; today we prove it. They assumed many other things that were sometimes untrue. 
	They trusted to intuition, but intuition cannot give us exactness, nor even certainty, and this has been recognized more and more. It teaches us, for instance that every curve has a tangent- - - that is to say every continuous function has a derivative - - and that is untrue. As certainty was required, it has been necessary to give less and less place to intuition.” pg 123

-I think Poincaré is referring to the research (mathematics) program which sought to place all of mathematics on a firm foundation. I have not read as much as I should about the history of this program, but I know Russell, Whitehead, and Gödel are major players. In any case, the remnants of this program is perhaps why mathematicians do their work in the symbolically abstract style that they do and also explains their reaction to the mathematical work of physicists like Feynman: If you have been trained to think intuitive mathematical reasoning can lead to incorrect conclusions, of course you would not trust such reasoning even when it is successfully used in the arguably less exacting context of physics. 

(For more on the history of rigor: James Pierpont, Mathematical Rigor: Past and Present (https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Allendoerfer/1992/0025570x.di021172.02p0031c.pdf), Israel Kleiner, Rigor and Proof in Mathematics: A historical perspective(https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.bams/1183492538 ),  A Short History of Rigor in Mathematics (http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/maths/math003.htm)

“Zoologists declare that the embryonic development of an animal repeats in a very short period of time, the whole history of its ancestors of the geological ages. It seems to me the same with the development of minds. The educator must make the child pass through all that his fathers have passed through more rapidly, but without missing a stage. On this account, the history of any science must be our first guide.” pg 127

-I think this is a really cool idea: In order to learn a subject a student must confront and ultimately overcome, the intellectual obstacles which challenged his or her predecessors. I say this idea in “How mathematicians Think.” Epistemic obstacles in understanding course material reflect the problems which arose when developing the theory. 

Poincaré uses this fact to argue why it is important to begin intuitively rather than rigorously. The rigorous approach is the correct one, of course, but the student would not internalize its necessity unless she first comes into contact with deficiencies in the intuitive method. 

For me this suggests, my problems learning rigorous mathematics perhaps parallel historical struggles which I am only now beginning to overcome. For my students, this suggests I should not jump into rigor before discussing a system/problem intuitively. Specifically, I should begin each new lesson with a question. 

“The principal aim of mathematical education is to develop certain faculties of the mind, and among these intuition is not the least precious. It is through it that the mathematical world remains in touch with the real world, and even if pure mathematics could do without it, we should still have recourse to fill up the gulf that separates the symbol from the reality. . . It is by logic that we prove, but by intuition that we discover. To know how to criticize is good, but to know how to create is better. 

-More on the importance of intuition, but here it refers to that importance in the work of mathematicians rather than physicists (as Einstein’s famous quote on imagination refers to) or in educating students. Terrence Tao has a blog post discussing the role intuition plays in developing the mathematical mind. 

“Without [intuition] the [pure mathematician] would be like a writer well up in grammar, but destitute of ideas.” pg 130

“There is one thing that strikes me, and that is, how far young people who have received a secondary education are from applying the mechanical laws they have been taught to the real world. It is not only that they are incapable of doing so, but they do not even think of it. For them the world of science and that of reality are shut off in water-tight compartments. It is not uncommon to see a well-dressed man, sitting in a carriage and imagining that he is helping it on by pushing on the dash-board, and that in disregard to the principle of action and reaction.” pg 138

-Hah, seems little has changed in 100 years. I think Mazur did a study in which he asked the public (or maybe even physicists) basic questions about the results of mechanics. I think an unsettling number of them got the answers wrong.

After Amy I

When I think back to those weeks nearly a year ago when Tony was preparing to leave, I ask myself if I wish I would have done anything differently. Assuming I had been given some sacred look into the future, a future which would show the ashes of our relationship and leave bitterness on my lips, would I want to live the days I lived with him more deeply, more chastely? I ask myself and I wait for an answer, hoping it to be honest, hoping it to guide me some how through where I have again found myself. The answer, the only one the comes, the one whose truth apart from anger and cynicism I cannot discern, is disconcerting. It tells me that if I had known what would become of Tony and I, I would not have spent the last month questioning his distance and cursing myself for being so affected by it. I wouldn’t have looked into his eyes and tried to determine how he felt or how he was capable of making me feel what I had felt. No. Given a glimpse of the subsequent two months of silence, the two months which I survived through means completely foreign to me, I would have, instead, walked away from him and toward the pain which was soon to meet me. I would not want to live with Tony in the present, tainted as it would be with the my knowledge of the betrayal which would follow. 


Above me, in a house in a city in a state in a country in a continent on the planet earth, are the words “Have Faith.” In what or in whom, I wonder. The words occur at the end of a list and are indented apart from the other elements to signify importance. It is as if to say, the above are important, but this “Faith” is the thing without which you cannot live. And I believe it, for I have lived it at times and failed to live it at others, and the difference between those times exist in the memories and pain  remain indelibly in the pain I cannot escape. 

I do not yet have this faith. But it seems I have now, more than I did in the past. When this is all over, there will be no “Thank You letter” to Amy. No unqualified appreciation for the things about myself she has revealed to me. Our love was good but not innocent of the lapses in human character endemic to our demographic. 

I do not think it is accurate to say the lesson I should abstract from this experience is that one should never sacrifice or change something important in one’s life just to maintain a relationship with someone else. Rather, one should be more discriminating about for whom the sacrifice is made and be more explicit about the terms of the sacrifice. I had sex with Amy when I did not want to, supported her when I was tired, and was understanding when I was annoyed, all based on the assumption that she would do the same for me. The result was that I was increasingly frustrated by a selfishness she could neither see nor stop from evincing. It was in large part my fear of ending my first relationship which made me so conciliatory, and it was in large part her experiences in her previous relationships which made her so clear about what she did and did not want, even if those desires made her into a hypocrite. 

And to be even more honest. It is not even entirely clear to me that had I been given foreknowledge of this end I would have tried to prevent its occurrence. There is of course the invaluable self-knowledge gained from this experience, but more basically I truly did enjoy the time I spent with Amy. It would be inaccurate to label our relationship as a sum of the wholly good or the wholly bad, when it had ample and incomparable portions of each. This is the large bargain you make when you enter a relationship with someone. The bargain of who they are holistically as a person you love.

After Amy II

When I think about what has been lost, I try to avoid hyperbole. Our relationship was good, perhaps even great, but it was not perfect. From the beginning, we fought, and the fights were not always about the same thing. There seemed to be a constellation of problems which could destabilize our evening and send us hurtling away from one another. First it was the lack of sex, then it was distance, then a distance induced by lack of sex. Initially, the recurrence of her claims to my body and physical intimacy was maddening and as if lashing out at Amy’s hysterics and insecurities, I exposed some of my own. I showed her that I was afraid to be alone and that I would not respond well to what I perceived as neglect. My hope was that she would be as patient and considerate as I was, or as I thought I was, with her but this was not to be. She made faint attempts at reciprocity, but apparently she had not been tutored in its long term application. 

Two weeks ago, she told me quite explicitly “I’m not very good at empathy right now.” This was surprising for her to say outright. Here we were in a relationship which had survived only because of the empathy I showed during her dissertation preparation and defense, and yet now she was telling me that she could not do the same. Of course, she had an excellent excuse: She was moving away by the end of the month and the mental and emotional resources required to manage the move had left her bereft of any such resources to apply to our relationship. It is strange that I did not take her admission for what it truly was, a  statement about the end of our relationship, but merely saw it as one of her many quirks. I spent the subsequent week waiting for her to make time for me. But she spent that week working late in the office and hanging out with other friends. 

The last night this occurred was last Thursday on the 10th. I asked her if she was working late again, and she told me no, but that she was going to a party with the other interns. I asked her if we could meet up afterwards, and she said she didn’t think so. I didn’t ask why, but I felt inexplicably devastated. I was thrown into a silent fury, that I bathed in all weekend and which led me to fantasize about ignoring her future text messages. But I didn’t. She flew off to Virginia to visit her cousin and his children, and amidst the texts we sent to one another, my anger cooled and I began to anticipate when I would see her again. By this point she was commanding full control of our meeting times. I was always available to see her, and she was seldom available to see me, so every time I suggested a meeting felt like rolling dice. She asked if we could meet after work on Monday. I agreed suggesting we meet in union square. She counter-suggested that we eat at Life-Alive, an organic vegan restaurant whose dishes I can tolerate. I said “Yes.” The location didn’t really matter to me. All that mattered was that I got to see her. 

During dinner we sat on the grass outside City Hall. I had walked by this location many times and had seen people, couples and groups of friends, sitting on the sloped lawn having lunch and talking, but they had always seemed to occupy a world of which I could never be a part. At one point I placed my hand on her leg and put my lips to her neck. She moved away “I’m just feeling out of commission,” she explained, “because of all the moving stress.” I nodded and took this in. 

Hours earlier I had anticipated this moment. What would you do, I had asked myself, If she again does not want to have sex? It had been a week, four days before she traveled to Virginia, since I had last tried to do something and she had last said she wasn’t interested. How would I feel if she did it again tonight? I didn’t think it was likely, but if it were to happen tonight, I promised myself I would take it with maturity. This was well enough, but I should have also asked myself what I would do if she said she wasn’t only not interested in sex, but not interested in being with me. 

“Will it be for the entire month?” I asked her. She didn’t answer this. Instead she spoke about her concerns with moving and planning her “next steps”. I didn’t ask again how long this would last. Instead, I removed my arm from her shoulder and sat still, my hands clasped together with my elbows resting on my knees. An NBC camera man and reporter were packing up in a van by the road. A woman with two large dogs struggled to keep them from pulling her in opposite directions. I stood up. “To stretch my legs,” I told her, but really it was to get away. As we walked back along the streets of Somerville, I kept my distance, refusing her requests to help me juggle balancing my bike with the leftovers from dinner. I needed time to think. But I still wanted to be in her presence. At a street corner, I asked her whether she wanted to sleep at my place or hers tonight. She looked at me awkwardly. “I kinda want to sleep alone tonight.” I don’t think I hid my shock too well, but I managed to remain silent. She went on to say that she had been meaning to talk to me. With all of her work this month and preparations for her move to Sacramento, she didn’t have the time or energy for our relationship. So, she said, we won’t be seeing too much of each other in the coming weeks. 

She seemed to be skirting around some conclusive statement.“So you're breaking up with me?” I asked. “Yes,” she said. I cannot lie. It hurt to hear her say this. I had known it was coming, but had believed there was still time for us. There were two weeks left of her stay in Cambridge, and I had been entertaining the dream that she would want to spend much of that time with me. And then of course there was the issue of sex. Months ago, she had asked if I could change my anti-depressants so that I desired sex (and her) more. I eventually did so ,and now that my desire for her had increased, she was telling me (after two weeks of her declining sex) that for her remaining two weeks in Cambridge she not only did not want to have sex, but she also did not really want to see me. I pointed this out to her, and her immediate response was that it’s only for two weeks. The hypocrisy was not lost on me. I thought about all our past conversations about sex and imagined how she would be reacting in my place had she made a similar change for me and then been implicitly told that the change did not matter. 

And yet I still do love her, and ache at the loss of what we had. But the truth of the human life, the truth of our planet, the sun which shines upon it, and possibly even our cosmological universe is that every start has a finish, and things which begin must end. American notions of “forever” may lead this statement to be confused. Of loving someone “forever”. Of being faithful “forever”. But in our universe “forever” does not exist. And more basically, our human sense of forever pales in comparison to the age of human civilization which itself pales in comparison to the age of our earth, the latter of which is huge, but ultimately finite, and thus lends finitude to all scales judged in comparison. And thus we must make peace with the endings of all things long before these endings arrive. Philosophically rendered this is a worthy goal, indeed, but it is one I, so habitually trapped in the tyranny of the present, have seldom achieved. But assuming I could achieve it, assuming I could make peace with the cycles of birth and death, then I should recognize that my despair should not be attached to the fact of an ending, which was inevitable, but to its context and tone.

What was that tone? Even now, separated from the event by merely two days, I cannot precisely decide the hue of it all. I remember feelings of anger and disappointment, but perhaps those feelings resulted from self-reflections rather than responses to what Amy wrought upon us.  

At one point I asked her if she felt better. She asked me what I meant. I didn’t know it myself. I was only responding to a sense that her confession had more to do with saving herself than saving me. 
	
	“Don’t you feel better now that you’ve told me all this?” I clarified. She said that she felt better, and she felt worse. Better because she was at last honest with me, and worse because she believed that she had betrayed my trust and that it “would take time,” if not forever, for me to trust her again. I thought this was a prescient articulation. Even I could not recognize at that moment that what I had felt was undistinguishable from betrayal. During our relationship, I had entered into a bargain in which I traded my values and integrity for love, or for what I thought was love, for a reciprocal promise of affection and compromise which was in fact never promised, but which I absurdly refused to admit was not truly there. I laughed. 
	
	“Ahh, you feel better now that you’re explaining to me why you have been avoiding me.” 
	
	Amy didn’t seem to agree with this. “I have not been avoiding you,” she said. “It wasn’t as though I was planning not to see you.” 

	“Ahh,” I said again, pretending to understand, “The word ‘avoid’ has too much intentionality to it?” 
	“Yes,” she agreed. 

	“So, it would have been better to use the word ‘neglect’?” She let out a soft moan of pain as if I had hit her, and like a child I felt proud to have induced this response. 

	“I’m joking,” I told her. We walked quietly for a beat, but for me time had seemed to lose all quality of demarcation. She had been slightly appeased, but I could not stop myself.

	“I’m just playing with you,” I said. “I know you don’t want to seem like a bad person.” At this she started to cry softly. I did not see her tears, for by then I had long ago stopped looking at her. Instead, I heard her sobs through the staccato of her voice. 

When we neared the corner of Beacon St. and Kirkland, she told me that she hoped to see me again before she left. An image went through my head of another frustrating night with her. I asked her if she was sure that was a good idea. She seemed prepared for this. She told me that she would ask me to dinner, but that I could say no and that she would understand. I was on the verge of commanding her not to ask me to save me from making the wrong decision and saying “yes” when the time came, but such an order, I knew, was a disavowal of responsibility. One of the major conflicts in our relationship was that she had been scrupulously faithful to her own emotions, and I, from insecurity and fear of losing her, had not. At least in our final weeks together, I should have the courage to say what I felt, independent of what I thought she was feeling.

I accepted her plans. And made the decision in my mind: She would ask me to dinner, and universe-willing, I will tell her no. By then she was standing somewhat close to me, as though she was expecting a hug goodbye. I could not muster the equanimity to give her what she wanted. All I felt was a psychological distance which was crying out to be made physical. “Goodbye Amy,” I told her. I climbed on my bike. “Goodbye Mobo,” she said back. I pedaled across the intersection, not even thinking about looking back, and soon I was halfway home.  




—-
Loose ends

It is not clear what her global perspective on the relationship is, but to me I seem 

- I wish I could honestly entertain the cynicism which claims I will never find anyone after Amy. Our conversations had a depth I had seldom experienced before, but whether they are worth being at the behest of Amy’s instabilities I am not sure. I still love her in spite of those instabilities, but their existence had always prevented me from seriously considering marrying her. I was just not clear where the line could be drawn between not being in a relationship and marriage.

- every stand if I indeed recognize this then my despair should not be attached to the fact of the ending but rather its tone. And what is that tone? 

things which start must finish, that every beginning has an end with which one must make peace long before it ever arrives. Worthy goal indeed, but one we humans so habitually trapped in a tyranny of the present can hardly achieved. But assuming I could achieve it, and assuming I indeed recognize that my
despair should not be attached to the fact of the ending (and ending which philosophically must have come eventually), but rather to its tone.

- So if you begin something, you must make peace with its eventual end at that very beginning if you are to live the intervening period with the authenticity and appreciation you will ultimately wish you had given it by the time you finally reach its conclusion. The nature of our world means we must make peace with the endings of all things long before these endings arrive.

- The irony of this situation was not lost on me. Months ago, she had asked if I could change my anti-depressants so that I desired sex (and her) more. And now having changed them and having my desire increased as a result, she was saying she was not interested in sex or in me. Never before had my quote about love felt more relevant: The unintended consequence of love is vulnerability. You attach your happiness to the whims and concessions of kindness of another and are every after at the mercy of their character.

I’m still in love with Amy. But I don’t think she’s in love with me. 
Confirmed (August 19): Amy is no longer in love with me, and she tells me she doesn’t know why.

For so long we created fantasies of the horror which would befall us once our humanity was eclipsed by the machines and software we developed to make life easier. And yet we never exercised comparable caution concerning the ways our creations were already making us less human.

After Amy: The Series
This weekend I told Amy I was still in love with her, and when she simply said “I’m honored,” and that she felt “confused and overwhelmed,” I decided to ask her directly the question which had tormented me for the preceding days: “You’re not in love with me anymore?” Four minutes later, she told me that she was no longer in love with me but that she did not know what had changed and that she tried not to think about it. Stunned by this admission, I rode my bike to 71 Highland Avenue in order to look into her eyes as she repeated all this. She was confused, she said, and stressed and she did not have the mental or emotional bandwidth to deal with our relationship. Hearing this in full, I took it better than I expected. Still, I wondered if there was someone else. No, she said, there was no one else. Her voice and manner were convincing. Or was I just all to willing to be convinced? I decided to believe her. 

Amy tells me she likes (or liked?) me more than she liked each of her past boyfriends, information which is character-revealing given what I see as her current and past selfishness. In this month of August, she has often discussed the possibility of us continuing the relationship in the future when we are again in the same city. She, emphatically, does not want me to wait for this fabled future, but she has entertained it as a possibility. For my part, I took these discussions silently, but now I don’t think I want this possibility realized. My naïveté concerning the depths of human hypocrisy and my inexperience with relationships built upon mutual attraction led me to accept certain aspects of my and Amy’s relationship that I do not want to repeat again. Most simply, given that my last memories of Amy will be drawn from this final month we are together, I do not see how it would be possible to continue from where we left off. The earth has not been scorched, but rather neglected, left without hydration and untoiled. In this final month, Amy has told me she is not interested in sex months after she successfully implored me to change my anti-depressants so that I would raise my libido to hers. She told me she was “not good at empathy right now,” after I conveyed to her something she did which hurt me. And, most recently, she told me she was “confused and overwhelmed,” when I told her I was in love with her. 

For all of Amy’s apparent maturity, she seems to have the emotional self-regulation of a teenager, and although I may have been willing to tolerate this under my assumption that she was the only person I could form an intellectual connection with and the only girl who was attracted to me, now that I no longer believe the latter (and our recent dissonances are causing me to question the former), I do not think I would be so understanding a second time around.

A year is a long time, and a large amount of growth could occur for both of us in the interim. Thus the possibility that our relationship could begin again in some proverbial future hinges not only on where we end up living on this earth, but also how we change during these transitions. And this contingency lends Amy’s departure a sobering hue of reality and frees me from the role of a benighted lover in some maudlin tragedy.

After Amy: The Series, II
The event that precipitated my and Amy’s first break up seemed innocuous to me when it occurred. For two nights before she returned to Cambridge from a trip to Virginia, I masturbated out of some mix of boredom and loneliness. On the night she returned, we spent the evening eating dinner and catching up. Later, when we went to her room she kissed me passionately with tongue, her standard signal that she wanted to have sex. I told her that I didn’t want to have sex that night, and after appearing to take it calmly for a minute, she soon regressed into rage. “You should have known I wanted to have sex tonight, after a week of not seeing each other.” “You should have exerted some self control and kept it in your pants for a few days.” I was so taken aback by the sense of entitlement lacing these words that it seemed for a moment that Amy and I were standing on opposite sides of a great hall rather than centimeters away from each other in bed. My disgust at her accusation was deep, and although sex was at that point out of the question, I ended up spending the night in her room. Early the next morning, I left her place in silence and anger. Simple self preservation would have led me to reflexively believe I had done no wrong, but coupled with her accusations that I had been selfish when I know I had not, I found in myself a delusional self-righteousness bordering on the kind she was evincing. 

We broke up (I think) shortly afterward. It was an unstated, “Well, I guess this is it,” sort of thing. But after a week, we came back together. I had never believed I would be in one of those spastic on-again-off-again relationships, but Amy and I fit that stereotype to a T. But after that first break up, we both agreed to use the remaining months of her time in Cambridge to the best of our emotional capacities. Our relationship had a deadline and before that deadline came, we should try to enjoy each other’s company as much as possible. Implicit in this agreement was the idea that we would make allowances for the idiosyncrasies of the other. Over time, I began to accept Amy’s seeming over-attachment to sex, and in moments of deep compassion, I told myself the source of the problem was not her intent to exert control over our relationship but rather a simple difference in our libidos. I eventually told my psychiatrist about the libido problems in this relationship, and she changed my medication to a milder dose, thus fulfilling a suggestion (or request?) that Amy had made months ago. 

This is all to say that I was fully prepared to accept and incorporate into my life the sexual dissonance between the two of us. I admit this was not an instantaneous acceptance. It took time for me to think that changing my anti-depressants was worth the risk and to soften my views about female entitlement, but when I eventually made these changes I absolutely felt closer to her. But perhaps I had taken too long to make them. 

Over the past month Amy has continually told me that she is non interested in sex. I would kiss her or place my hand on her thigh and then she would move away and tell me that we weren’t having sex tonight. I would ask her why. She would venture that with all the preparations for her move to Sacramento, she was feeling emotionally drained. When pressed further, she admitted that she really did not know the cause of this change, but implicit in this non-answer was the idea that I would have to accept this new reality. 

Both of these reactions to sex—the intense need for it and the unexplained apathy—I could easy tolerate in separate people. One person might want more sex and another might want less, and I can imagine, provided I thought the relationship was worth it, that I would adjust in each case. It is not event that I am expecting an idealistic consistency in a single person. I could conceivably also appreciate the way sexual desire waxes and wanes, the way you might lust after a partner today and then feel nothing but staid affection tomorrow. 

However, what I cannot abide by is Amy’s unapologetic positions of self-righteousness in both cases.. When were were not having enough sex (by her measure), it was my fault and my responsibility to change. Hence, her recommendation concerning my anti-depressants. But more recently, now that she is not at all sexually interested in me, I am expected to fully and maturely accept these new feelings as well. My inclinations toward debasement and self-abnegation are considerable, but even Amy’s demands, demands from someone I love, are wearing thin. Accepting these changes, this moving of the goal posts, would lend her too much power. It would secede to her the right to dictate not only when it is reasonable to have sex but also under what conditions it is acceptable to say “No”. Or rather under what conditions it is acceptable for her to say “No,” because there was never a situation in which my “No,” was greeted with acceptance and understanding.

Perhaps, most perversely, I could not realize this on my own. It was only after Amy broke up with me last week that a temporal and spatial distance was forced upon me and I was thus forced to confront the reasons underlying the ebb and flow of our relationship. Being with Amy was intoxicating and the week after the break up was harder than any of the previous post-break up weeks because we had come close enough to her departure date for me to realize that this was likely the end. But now instead of grief, I appreciate the emotional distance Amy’s breakup thrust upon me. Without question, I will miss her and I do still love her. But as she currently is, she would need to be with someone whose pliancy allows him to accept not only her highs and her lows but also her self-preserving rationalizations of them. I tried to be that person, and, as evidenced by her decision to end the relationship, I fell short. Hopefully someone else can do better.

After Amy: The Series, III
When answering a question about how his exes responded to his depiction of love in his books, Junot Diaz placed his answer in context by saying these exes are inevitably people who are glad to have escaped you. I guess this is partly how I feel. I love Amy, but I need to be free from her, for, as she says, she cannot currently control how she feels and she isn’t even absolutely sure what she feels, all of which means she can hurt me and then feel no need to take responsibility for causing me that pain. 

A week ago, I was lost and in despair. I could not see the path before me stretching toward any desirable future. Alas, over the course of a week, my sight has not improved. Truly, all I can see is what is before me, but now I know that what is before me is a path upon which I can still walk.

Motifs in Physics Introduction

After a few years spent learning physics, one finds that certain ideas occur again and again. This is not too surprising given that physics as a dicipline has a unity of approach which leads to many different subfields concerned with different phenomena, but largely having the same body of techniques and auxiliary concepts used to understand and model that phenomena. In these series of notes we present  major recurrent ideas in physics and situate them in the various physical disciplines they’re found. The goal is to show that physis although seemingly large and multifarious/disparate has a unity in the larger scale ideas/claims it makes about the physical world. 

The motifs we will discuss in these notes are


In Bioglogical Physics: A Search for Principles, William Bialek distinguishes physics from biology by asserting that physics although having a diversity of subject matter is unified by a commonality of approach. The mathematical and deductive structure of physics in which physical predictions are derived from principles exists as surely in quantum mechanics as it does in plasma physics, and thus all physicists (or, at least theorists) have a common set of practices and general methods to understanding the world even if what they are attempting to understand is unique to their sub-discipline. Out of this common set of practices arise ideas and approaches to understanding nature which repeatedly appear throughout physics. In this set of notes, we outline and discuss eight recurrent ideas which we term “motifs in physics”. The goal is to show through many disparate examples that the sub-disciplines of physics although extensive and multifarious are unified by the larger scale ideas they uncover in their study of the physical world. 

A comment about the title of this work: Why do we use the slightly more technical term “motif” rather than the more easily accesible “theme”? The choice boils down to precision and humility. By its literary usage, the “theme” in a work concerns the central idea or message of the writing. However, we humans, striving everyday to build new and better understandings of our physical world, cannot be so presumptuous as to believe that we currently know “the central ideas” behind physics. A basic knowledge of science history discourages such speculation. Go back a little more than a century, and any such themes  scientists put forward would seem incredibly limited today. 

But a “motif” in a work, as simply a recurrent idea or image in the piece, is less sweeping. It does not presume we can ever know the purpose of the creator, but it does suggest we can intuit his or her constant preoccupations. For example, physicists at the end of the 19th century would have been proven wrong in a few decades, if they had claimed that the theme of physics concerned finding the deterministic dynamics of all systems, but they would still be correct if they labeled such determinisim as a motif in physics. Thus as a hedge, we term these recurrent elements, rather than the more authoritative “themes in physics”,  “motifs in physics.”

Terming the unifying ideas in physics “themes” presumes it is possible intuit the purpose of the creator,  an inevitably non-rigorous practice daily engagement with science encourages us to avoid. 

This work is inspired by a blog post by Philip Tanedo termed “Five Under Appreciated Ideas in Undergraduate Physics.” This work is also in the spirit of the “Six Easy Pieces,” and “Six Not So Easy Pieces” by Feynman in which important and complicated ideas in physics are discussed qualitatively. 

The eight themes we will discuss in the subsequent notes are as follows.

Achieving
Wish: Think about the next four weeks, what is your most important wish?
Outcome: What would be the best outcome if I fulfill this wish?
Obstacle: What stops me from fulfilling this wish and experiencing the outcome? What is it in me which stands in the way of achieving this? (emphasis is on the self)
Plan: If this obstacle occurs, then I will X (behavior to overcome obstacle)

Notes from Group Meeting on August 15 (or what I remember from the meeting)

(Order of Magnitude T_c) Need to be more careful about T_c calculation. You should use the free energy of the string rather than the melting temperature (The melting temperature is independent of the length of the ssDNA so it is not what you want to use) and you need to make sure to compare the energy of a favorable contact to the energy of an unfavorable contact. 
(Heat Capacity Simulation) You present a simulation of the order parameter but no such simulation of the heat capacity. This heat capacity could be simulated by computing the variance in the energy and using your existing Monte Carlo software
(Third Critical Exponent) Need to compute gamma, the divergence of the variance or the divergence of the susceptibility at the critical temperature. This would complete the picture. 
By my measure, the experimental work is too difficult to complete 
Single molecule studies might be preferred? (Would the transitions between states be encompassed in such models?)
William stated that there is a better way to measure number of correctly paired dsDNA. He didn’t say what that method was. 
To estimate the energy of interaction between favorable and non-favorable contacts you can consider the interaction energy between base pairs and stacking of DNA. 
Having multiple copies of contacts can affect the statistics of the problem and thus change the physical predictions you make.

Notes from Bok Center Teaching Conference

Facilitating Active Learning in the Classroom
It’s useful to start the class with an active learning exercise. Something like this for a Biology class: “A zookeeper enters the cage of a female snake who has been kept alone for 14 years. He finds a baby snake next to the mother. What questions would you like to ask the zookeeper?”
An intriguing question leads immediatly to engagement
Think-Pair-Share: You can ask students to work alone for two minutes (allows them to think independently), then they can discuss their answers with a partner, and finally they share their answer with the class
*This is similar to your starter problems, except instead of allowing students to discuss amongst themselves and then present their work to the class, you presented the solution to them. (Advantage to “pair-share:” students get to correct their own thinking; Advantage to your method: you get to collect student work and check individual student understanding)

Random Note: Researchers did a meta-analysis of active learning practices v.s. passive learning practices. They learned that active learning resulted in better long term recall and a greater delta in pre-post test scores. 
Makes me think that a way to improve social science research is to do meta-analysis on research studies. That is, instead of reading one study and then making a claim about what it means for every day life, one should collect many related studies and weigh them against one another to see whether any possible claims are supported by independent research groups. 

Learning Catalytics and Poll Everywhere are free software that you can use to poll your classrooms.

Active Learning Strategies
Anonymous Cards: distribute cards to students; students write question; other students go home and research question and return to the class to report their answer.
I like this strategy. Contributes to students learning how to become self-monitoring questioners
Student Walkthrough: students present a solution to a problem they worked out individually or in groups. 
you used this strategy in Physics 143a 2017
Statement Correction: Give a problem context with an intentional mistake and then you ask students to find the error and state why they think there is an error. 
Louis used these types of problems in many assignments of Summer of 2015
You have to be absolutely sure there aren’t any unintentional errors in these problems (One of the physics 143a problems you used with this format had an error)
This would be a good way to review homework or exam questions where students made common mistakes 
Strip Sequence: Begin with a process you want students to undertand. Divide the process into steps and put each step on a strip of paper. Then ask students to offer correct orderings for the steps. 
Comment about Grouping
Randomize groups so that people are not with their friends (might also be worthwhile to think carefully about grouping)
Also randomize who speaks in the group. (The person who speaks has the next closest birthday, or most recently watched a movie)

Problem Sets in STEM
What is the motivation in creating a problem set?
Having students practice material?
To evaluate student understanding?
To encourage students?
*Force students to study the way you want them to study. 
How do you come up with questions?
Use older assignments
Think carefully about what skills you want students to practice and construct questions around these skills. 
How do you determine whether a question is good?
You can show it to other students and instructors.

Thoughts of the Future

Yesterday I met with Matt Reece. He returned Selected Problems in Theoretical Physics and we talked about my plans for graduate school and what comes after. It was a question I should have been prepared for, but for the past month or year I’ve been too focused on what was before me, the work in the coming weeks which had yet to be done. It is strange but common to be so focused on where you are now that you feel you have no time to consider where you are going, where you want to go, why you want to go there. The stories we tell ourselves about the need to remain “present focused” and the fact that plans often go awry are just more ways we justify not contemplating a future we are afraid of meeting. And yet at the same time, I constantly dreamed about aspects of this future, dreamed of papers and books I finished and of the love which would surely and finally be bestowed upon me when the world learned of my greatness. The dreams bolstered me and yet blinded me. They filled me with wonder and power, but also made me uninterested in working out the steps to ensure their realization. 

And here was Matt forcing me to focus a bit more on what those exact steps were. 

I told him that I had always wanted to graduate earlier rather than later. He had asked why. I didn’t have a good reason. I had taken a gap year before starting graduate school, so I didn’t want to spend more time than I had to here. Would I want to apply to post docs this year then? I hadn’t thought about such applications seriously. They would be due in October, he said. Also, he continued, it would probably be useful to have more of a publication record built up. More papers are better than one. I nodded. This was all very reasonable. What kind of work do you want to do for the post doc. I didn’t know. I did know that I wanted to be somewhat independent, sort of like how I was working now, but I didn’t know if I wanted to continue working in the field/direction I currently found myself. Matt suggested something interdisciplinary would probably be good for me. Also, a post-doctoral fellowship which was not attached to a specific professor but which gave me funds with no strings attached. He listed many fellowships in this direction: The Junior Fellowship at Harvard, Pappalardo Fellowship at MIT, KITP fellowships in Santa Barbara, Princeton Fellowships in Theoretical Science, A Berkeley Fellowship, and a Caltech Institute Wide Fellowship. 

He also warned me of something he perhaps saw in me. It is something that Jesse and Krishna saw in me too: Idealism. He said these fellowships were finite periods of time and although there are many interesting problems one could solve, one ultimately had to devote one’s time to things which produced clear results. In other words, being a scientist was a job much like many others, and thus there would be a  cost to failing to fulfill the requirements of this job even if they were implicit. 

I am a child of immigrant parents, parents who spent my entire life battling a poverty they did quite well shielding me from. Financial motivations should have always been quite potent for me, and although I feel more strongly influenced by them with each passing year, I cannot help but see their pursuit as some pursuit of nihilism. 

He finally said that I should create opportunities to meet people. In many of the positions I will be applying to there will be many other applications just like mine, and so there is an unavoidable element of luck in getting an interview or even a job. This luck could be improved if I were to meet hiring committees or potential bosses in person. So I should see the many colloquia we have at Harvard as chances to learn who I might want to work with and to show people who I am. It would be difficult given that my work doesn’t seem connected to a single discipline of physics or chemistry, so it is not clear that future colleagues/senior professors will know anything about my current advisor. This is all the more reason to communicate to prospective employers myself what I do and why it is of value. 

I have always liked speaking with Matt. Unlike Jesse, he had never been patronizing even subtly so when I told him about my project ideas. But I could not help walking away from this meeting feeling as though I had been scolded. Undoubtedly the feeling stemmed from discomfort at seeing a possible future that I did not want to be realized. Did I really want to be a post-doc? Did I want to stay on the academic treadmill? The prospect of doing so floored me and I spent the rest of the day after our meeting in a fog. I couldn’t work. I didn’t want to. What was the point if all of it was building to a future I did not really want?

I had once said that one should always be motivated by “pull” feelings rather than “push” feelings. “Push” feelings, I said, were ultimately scattering. They stemmed from a desire to escape something, arose from fear and the ego’s hunger for the preservation of a self, real or imagined. We apply to college and to graduate school and we jump through hoops, not because we find anything intrinsically rewarding about these pursuits but because we are afraid of living through what might befall us if we didn’t. From such fear you can be driven toward a place of apparent safety which is upon closer inspection simply just a cage built from unfamiliar material. 

But “pull” emotions, I believed, resulted from recognizing and valuing something outside yourself and then devoting yourself to this external thing. Such feelings were focusing and propelling, promising a stretch and maybe even a transformation of the self as one seeks to become the person who can achieve the sought after goal. But when I think back on the previous two years, I see that my dreams of my future, things ostensibly pulling me toward something better, had always been less motivating than the anger and fear which drove me to escape past versions of myself. The dreams were images I had always entertained, but it was only upon seeing all my past notebooks accumulated throughout high school and college that I felt rage at a life spent abdicating promises I made to myself. It was this rage that vaulted me out of a soporific complacency which told me it would be OK to wait for another time. It was only after this rage and after fully feeling the fear of dreams left unrealized, that I completed the first draft of a project which led to the paper I wrote this April.

Can I capitalize on such fears again? I see the life I can live as a post-doc and I do not want it. But years ago, I also saw the life I could live as a graduate student and felt the same thing. Back then this fear was so great it paralyzed me and eclipsed any faith I had in myself to create and live some alternative. But here I am doing just that. Each day I am living the narrow escape of a future I had always thought was both inevitable and fatal. Somewhere along the way the fear metastasized into a positive force, which led me away from living through graduate school the way I was “supposed” to live it. Somehow I had managed to find something better. 

I think I can do so again. But I need to tread carefully. I cannot engage too deeply in the day dreams which are more a means of escape rather than a route to planning. But also I cannot wait to begin until all plans have been laid out. 

For there is a possible fear here. A fear which holds your future hostage with the ransom being control. But it is not true that everything must be worked out. It is not true that you must see the entire road. You may not have confidence in these words because you find it difficult to have faith in life as it currently presents itself to you. But in so far as you value courage as a philosophical practice and not merely as a practice of philosophy you can recognize the immense courage it takes to have faith in a world you do not understand, in people who always have the potential to disappoint you, in life events which deviate from the path you had always wanted them to go. 

The story will become what it will become. This attachment we have to control is not precisely unhealthy as it is realistic and suffocating. It is you attempting to build a cage to house something growing faster than you can build. Far better would it be to just let the thing roam free without bounds, without presuppositions of where it will or should grow. You have to relinquish control. Allow the story and allow your life to become, if not what it was “meant” to become, surely what it cannot help but be.

And in the middle ground between this relinquishing and a fidelity to both the fears and loves which have motivated, there is perhaps a life which you can carve out, a life which you would enjoy. 


[//]

It was the anger I felt at seeing all of my past notebooks, collected throughout high school and college, which finally led me to make good on a promise I made to myself long ago. It was only through this anger that I completed the first drajft of a project which led to the paper I wrote this April. 

So 

If you attempt to build a cage around something which is growing faster than you build 

It is 

Allow the resistance to be your fuel. 

There is a fear here.

Reconciling the Loss
At 3:20 PM today, I bid Amy farewell. We hugged and I kissed her feeling far from what I felt on that brisk December day of last year. Rather than hope and anticipation, I felt loss and a greying of the world in stark dissonance with the beautiful weather of the day. She entered a black SUV with license plate 2EV-something. It idled on Oxford St slightly past the gates leading to Lamont. I was a few paces past the gate on my way to Broadway when I turned around and the SUV was gone. 

Much has changed since my entry of two weeks ago. After I rode my bike to her place to ask if she still loved me, Amy and I agreed to keep our dinner plans for the coming Tuesday. On the night of the dinner, she came to my place and we walked to Union Square as she told me about her moving and packing challenges. We walked to The Independent, a bar that was the setting of one of our many conversations about sex and our relationship. But the bar was closed, so we went to El Potro and sat outside to enjoy the night breeze. I cannot remember what Amy was wearing or how exactly she looked, but I remember being mesmerized by her. The way she talked. The way she moved. Her body. Her skin. I told her she really looked beautiful tonight. She laughed and thanked me. Halfway through the dinner I asked if I could sit closer. She said yes and I moved my chair to her left side, my right hand on her thigh. Soon i had both of her calves in my lap and I worked to massage away all the stresses and all the tension she had accumulated over the past month. Part of me realized what I was doing: I was trying to seduce her. But more plainly, I just wanted to be near her to touch and feel the warmth I was terrified of losing even as I was losing it. 

I guess that was the night that pulled us from the abyss, the series of moments which salvaged our final two weeks together, salvaged my final memories of her, and thus gave her space again in my heart. The following day, she came to the office to print something and we ended up spending half the afternoon together. First walking to the science center and then to the courtyard between the chemistry and music buildings. Later that night, after I watched the penultimate episode of Game of Thrones with Brian and EJ, she invited me over, not necessarily so we could sleep together, she clarified, but just to see each other. This arrangement was fine for me. By then I had so hungered just to see her and be near her that sex seemed unnecessary. 

But we did have sex that night and two more times a few days later. That night was the first time in a month and it almost felt like our true first time several months ago. Touching her thighs, inhaling the air above her skin, kissing her lips. It all felt ethereal in comparison to the sensations of many trysts past. 

After that night it seemed our relationship had been restored by the one act which so often had threatened to destroy it. We were friends again and lovers. And most significantly of all, we did not fight, did not argue. I tried my best to be there for her and I resolved to not be bothered if she could not return the favor. But this resolution was unnecessary. I did not feel neglected, or ignored in these past two weeks. Far from it. Most of the time we spent together was directed toward preparing for her trip to Brazil and perhaps this objective lent our interactions a focus which allowed no room for my insecurity. 

Or more likely I had found ways to deal with my insecurity outside of our relationship. Days before Amy broke up with me—and would it even be accurate to call it that given what happened after?—I logged onto Jack’d in a fit of loneliness and frustration. Talking to the guys on that app with even no intention of an outcome soaked up much of my Amy-directed anxiety. It became OK that she was spending her nights somewhere not near me since now I had dozens of anonymous and, at times, literally faceless strangers I could talk to. During the week after our talk on the Cambridge City Hall lawn, I dipped into Jack’d again and again to distract my self from an encroaching emptiness which seemed close to enveloping me. It did not completely work; I spent several days in be for many hours more than was maturely appropriate, and I  ate too many cookies and drank too much soda. I was not a wreck, but I was approaching one. Perhaps the shallowness of the interactions on Jack’d saved me from deeper contemplation of what I thought I had lost. And perhaps when what was lost re-entered my life I had at last become numb to the triggers which made me accuse Amy of neglect. 

Quizas. Quizas. Quizas. 

Regardless of whatever emotional maturation did or did not precede it, these past two weeks have dreamlike. Spending as much time with Amy as I did, now feels like a gift I did not deserve. Two nights ago, I sat awake watching her sleep. I was trying my best to focus on this moment with her in my bed and with darkness all around us. I believed this would be a memory I would return to again and again. I wanted to preserve every detail of her body and of her exhales, so that on some future night days, months, or years from now I would be able to conjure her up from the proverbial abyss, from the remnants of lives long lived and memories long faded and have her with me and remember that, once, I knew love.

Time and Distance
Is it the nature of most break ups for one to believe at one moment that he has lost some life-giving force only to later find that instead of being lost one has in fact been set free? It has been about two weeks since Amy left and four weeks since she formally broke up with me. I remember that first week months ago being incredibly trying. Insomnia, loss of appetite, fogged thinking. It was as if some needed medicine had been immediately discontinued, forcing me to fend for myself against the disease it had kept at bay. But now it seems that the supposed medicine was in fact a toxin and what I was experiencing was not withdrawal, but the trauma of returning to a world I had once forgotten. 

On many levels I will always love Amy, but I am glad she is in Brazil and not here in Cambridge. For if she were here, we would, due to habit and familiarity, still be together. Few relationships are wholly bad, and maybe even fewer are wholly good. Most are immersed in seas of nuance, moments too complicated to be accurately described by just one word, and yet if life is to improve and we are to grow, the postscript must always be definitively titled. We must come down on one side or the other, at least in so far as it is necessary to decide whether we would want something similar to happen again. Amy, beautiful, intelligent, and warm as she was could also be cold, selfish, and uncompromising. And as I was always yielding, she was constantly putting up more demands, an ever growing list of ways I could change to promote the survival of our relationship. On her part, she tried to change too, but it was of her volition rather than by my request. While she was telling me to change my anti-depressants so that I desired her more, she was actively questioning her attachment to sex, an interrogation which ultimately made her desire me less. All through this I was a passive participant, content to enjoy her company and our conversation, maladaptive as they were, without any presumption of needed change. 

It has never been my philosophy to change the people I am close with. I have a challenging enough time trying to change myself. Thus I developed a certain all or nothing perspective with regard to my friendships: Either I could tolerate your character, your personality, etc. Or I could not and if I could not then we could not in the long-term stay friends. Thus upon seeing a character trait I disapproved of, I would often pre-emptively cut off the relationship never even deigning to explain to the other party why. My tacit belief was that they should know why and even if they didn’t, it did not matter for the result would be the same: They would be who they were and I would be who I was and the distance between us would ever after be clear.

Amy had a different philosophy. After the end of a Storycollider event, when I left her because I was tired of her ignoring me, she told me I should have said what was wrong so I could have given her the chance to make an informed decision. Her implication: If she knew I felt ignored, she would have tried to correct it. This, I must say, is a mature perspective on relationships, a perspective stemming from a solid faith in the possibility inherent in the meeting of two people, but it is no wonder I did not develop such a perspective myself: The underlying confidence in people such a perspective requires has, over years and episodes, eroded in me. 

So although Amy and I had problems, the problems at the time never seemed so large to me that they necessitated escape least of all a request for Amy to change. It was annoying, I said, that she felt sexually entitled to my body, but ultimately this was not devastating. It was frustrating to find that I was always making time for her but our time together was always modulated by her attachment to whatever project she was working on. It was not only habit that made these issues tolerable, it was also my wonder at finding in Amy an intellectual mirror, someone whose interests and analyses paralleled my own and thus both improved me and connected me to another person. At the time, I would have believed the balance of feeling and experiences tilted decidedly to one side with me believing that Amy was what I had for the longest time been searching for. But even this belief was just another reflection of my faithlessness in the world, a belief that the world had so few gifts that even the love which reduces and controls you is a love for which you can only be grateful. 

And I am indeed grateful, but now this gratitude exists on two levels for Amy has twice freed me. She first freed me from my cage of intellectual and emotional isolation and a month ago she freed me from the  cycle of tempest and tranquility that was our relationship. It seemed as if not matter what I did, I was never enough for her. So my hope is that one day she will find someone that is enough, or at least someone whose inadequacies are tolerable. On my part, the geographic distance between Amy and I and the time we’ve spent away from each other makes me see all my relationships in a new light. Amy was amazing and I have found few women that compare to her in warmth and character. And yet I am forced to admit that even these traits are not worthy of what I was willing to sacrifice—my work and my peace of mind—in order to be with her. And so I find myself being pulled into a possibly dangerous level of honesty born of a learned indifference. Why hide myself from people to gain from them an acceptance I do not really need? 

This too is another thing from which Amy freed me: The tacit conviction that between two people there is a possibility of seamless integration in which both people are completed through the process. Other people, as necessary as they are, cannot on their own make you whole. You must take the lessons and experience gathered from living with (or rather, through) them and create from these a makeshift identity which exists as well by yourself as it does with them.

Notes on “No one reads your paper either” (http://serialmentor.com/blog/2013/11/3/no-one-reads-your-paper-either) by Claus Wilke

This guy talked about why people should still publish papers even though no one seems to read many of the papers you publish. He came up with four lessons which underly work and explain why you should keep publishing. 

1. You don’t know which of your papers people will like. The more you publish the higher the chance that something you write is useful to somebody. 

He then stated “frequent publishing builds an audience”, which to me sounds a lot like Baldwin’s quote that “The artist has to assume that he creates his audience and that the audience won’t be there until he starts to work.” This means you shouldn’t just write short pieces, believing that over time you will be discovered. Rather, one gradually builds and extends the network of anonymous people one connects to by continuously publishing work. 

His next point states the reason for this. 

2. You need to keep publishing regularly so people are aware of you and take you more seriously. 

His explanation is that if your publish regularly, people will start taking notice of you and they will be more prone to keep an eye out for your work. Consequently, when you finally publish something good you already have a ready and waiting audience. 

3. You need to publish as much as possible so you develop the writing and responding-to-reviewers skills that you will need to write your major hits. 

Moreover he asserts that frequent publishing (and the frequent writing skills it requires) trains you in the habits necessary for publishing your greatest hits. It would be a shame for you to have an excellent idea and be unable to properly express it or get it through the review process simply because you didn’t develop the skills to do so. With every paper you write, you get a little better (at writing and research) so you should still make the effort to write up your work. 

4. The best way to get a weak idea out of your head is to publish a paper on it. Don’t dwell on weak ideas, publish them and move on. 

In the author’s words “publishing clears the mind.” You might have a lot of ideas which are weighing you down. Publishing them frees you from them and allows you to think more easily about future work. Strangely, then “so-so” ideas for papers can be detrimental to finding better ideas since they are not so terrible that they are dismissed outright and they are not so good that you want to publish them immediately. Instead they just take attention and energy away from better ideas.

Dreams of Amy 
Is it strange that now that both Jiwon and Amy are gone, I only daydream about the good moments I had with the first and the bad moments I had with the second, when in fact when they were both here, I could only feel tension and annoyance with Jiwon and warmth and appreciation with Amy? I have even come as far as almost writing off all my concessions and compromises for Amy as mistakes. But I knew what I was doing back then, I understood the nature of the trade and the risks. I did it anyway and I will probably do it again. Not because I am foolish, but because I have seen life without love and have also seen life with it and I am made stronger by this knowledge. And this strength, contrary to popular opinion, came after courage rather than before it. And so I hope I may have such courage again.



September 24, 2017 — Sunday 12: 18 AM
Elana
Last weekend I slept with Elana. We have known each other for about two years, but it was only last week that we mutually acknowledged our attraction for each other. After seeing the play “Plank,” we ate dinner at Dali, and then I walked her to her place. Before leaving, I kissed her and she kissed me, and soon we were behind her building and I was slipping my hands into her pants. She stopped me. Was this place too public, she asked. Of course it was. I had gotten carried away. I apologized, and she told me there was no need to apologize. I apologized two more times, and kissed her goodbye. We decided we would meet the next night for dinner. We did, and after a somewhat awkward dinner, we went back to my place, where I led her to my room and over the course of 30 minutes took off all her clothes. 

I never imagined I would be the kind of man (or person) who enjoyed dominating someone. But there was something empowering about touching Elana and watching her writhe in ecstasy. Even Amy (who loved sex) never reacted this way. I would kiss Elana’s stomach and she would exhale. I’d kiss her neck and she would grab mine. I’d enter and she’d dig her nails into my back. She was the receptive partner all the way through. I was acting and acting and acting and she was accepting. But far from feeling used, I felt safe and free and was soon high off my sense of control. For the record, I came twice and apparently so did she. 

She slept over and the morning after, I walked her to her apartment. The walk was strange, certainly awkward, and I had trouble keeping up with her fast pace. A day later I texted her asking how her Sunday apple picking trip went. No response. Did she regret what we did? Did she feel as though it changed our friendship? Did she want me and that night to vanish into some suppressed recess of her mind? Was I projecting all this? I waited six days before sending another text. “Is there anything wrong?” I asked. After not receiving anything for a few hours, I turned off my phone. This was all making me crazy. I turned on my phone after I finished writing my department annual progress report. “Nothing’s wrong! Did you get my texts?” Ahh, I thought. It was my phone. She did not want me to disappear. She probably hadn’t even been thinking of me too much this week. I was once again looking out at the world and only seeing the reflection of my insecurity. 

Consider the alternative that I nearly fell into. What would have happened if she had indeed ignored my message and all subsequent queries> The incident would have indicated, on the surface, that I could not trust Elana, but it would also mean, perversely, that I could not trust myself. Because it was of course my choice to open myself to her, my choice to sleep with her. It was a decision born of the belief that she had courage and empathy, and would not disappear as so many others might. And so if she were to vanish, then thus both she, the actor, and I, the precipitator of the act, would share responsibility for my pain. And moreover, because her actions exist far beyond the locus of my control, the lesson I would learn would lead to a reigning in of envoys, a further limitation to possible journeys. Fearing the people who may hurt me and recognizing my apparent an inability to recognize who such people are, I would try to affect the things I can and would simply stop trying to know anyone. With my loss of trust in my own intuition, my loss of trust in my ability to judge and react to the goodness proverbially in all of us, I would decide, in great cowardice, not to act, to withdraw the queries and probes for love and affection. This decision, if carried out faithfully, could destroy some buoy in me, making me weaker even as it promises to make me strong. And with such weakness, I would lose further faith in myself and in my actions in the world. In all, the original insecurity would have led to more insecurity, the noose simply tightening as I struggled to get free. 

It seems I have, for the moment, been saved from this cycle, but I know all is not safe: I am not so naive as to believe that, simply because I managed to escape, I am no longer being pursued. I know I am not yet free of the insecurity which would have dropped me into the spiral, and I know, having missed its chance, it waits for me in some future I have not yet lived. I hope, by then, to be ready. But hope alone is for the impotent. Those with agency must work and prepare for the world they want to see.

I distrust plot for two reasons: first, because our lives are largely plotless, even when you add in all our reasonable precautions and careful planning; and second, because I believe plotting and the spontaneity of real creation aren’t compatible. It’s best that I be as clear about this as I can — I want you to understand that my basic belief about the making of stories is that they pretty much make themselves. The job of the writer is to give them a place to grow (and to transcribe them, of course). 

. . . Stories aren’t souvenir tee-shiest or GameBoys. Stories are relics, part of an undiscovered pre-existing world. The writer’s job is to use the tools in his or her toolbox to get as much of each one out of the ground intact as possible. Sometimes the fossil you uncover is small; a seashell. Sometimes it’s enormous, a Tyrannosaurus Rex with all those gigantic ribs and grinning teeth. Either way, short story or thousand-page whopper of a novel, the techniques of excavation remain basically the same. 

No matter how good you are, no matter how much experience you have, it’s probably impossible to get the entire fossil out of the ground without a few breaks and losses. To get even most of it, the shovel must give way to more delicate tools: air hose, palm-pick, perhaps even a toothbrush. Plot is a far bigger tool, the writer’s jackhammer. You can liberate a fossil from hard ground with a jackhammer, no argument there, but you know as well as I do that the jackhammer is going to break almost as much stuff as it liberates. It’s clumsy, mechanical and anti-creative. Plot is, I think, the good writer’s last resort and the dullard’s first choice. The story which results from it is apt to feel artificial and labored.

September 29, 2017 — Friday 2:41 PM
Script 
Purpose: (~ 5 mins)
Understand what distinguishes research and thinking in physics
Consider ways the “physics-approach” to understanding systems is useful in or out of physics
Develop an expanded understanding of why we develop models
Modeling in the Classroom (~ 10 mins): Begin with “Designing a Lecture Hall” problem; begin with one students’s solution to part (b), and ask him or her to explain it; allow for questions from the other students; another student lists their choices for part (a) and discusses the model they created.
Group Discussion (~ 10 mins): Divide students into four groups of four. Each group divides a white board into two spaces. On one side students discuss what characterizes thinking and research in physics AND on the other side (using the “Modeling in the Classroom” activity) students discuss the purposes of a model and why scientists create models. (Person with the upcoming birthday speaks) (~10 mins)
Bialek and Biological Physics (~ 5mins): As an introduction to the last task, review Bialek’s definition of physics, biology, and biological physics; Present Venn diagram; Present question “Should mathematical models be used in biology or, more generally, outside the traditional domain of physics?”
Pro and Con for Mathematical Models in Biology (~20 mins): Divide students into two groups and ask the pro-group to construct an argument for using mathematical models and the con-group to construct an argument against. (Give 5 mins to construct argument) Pro-group comes back and presents resolution for why mathematical models are useful, and then there is a free discussion period where the con-group asks questions (2 mins+5 mins). Then the Con-group presents a resolution for why they should not be used, and then there is a free discussion period (2 mins + 5mins). 
Afterward, we regroup as a class. I ask are there any arguments the other side didn’t present that you think they could present?
Presentation for Physics Approach to Life Sciences (~ 10 mins): Discuss physicists moving outside of physics
XKCD comic: Joke about how physicists approach new fields of study. (Students might mention reductionism as a characteristic of physics. 
Mention that the comic illustrates how this approach to science is laughable when the details that reductionism misses are important.
Mention personal experience with working with biologists. Biologists and physicists seem to have differing value systems. Physics teaches you to ignore details to get at the essence of a physical system, but in biology details are very important. (For example, there is no general model of how proteins fold as given by their sequences. Instead, biologists develop a working knowledge of the various metabolic and stability properties of a host of proteins.)
Physics Envy: Lee Smolin video
Main problem: When adapting a tool to a new context you often need to change the original purpose so that the tool is more-context appropriate.
Why we Model (~ 5 mins): In physics the main purpose of models is to predict, but outside of physics mathematical modeling cannot always be used to cleanly predict outcomes. Instead it gets a new purpose. 
Predict
AND (for both mathematical and non-mathematical models)
Explain (distinct from predict; e.g., Cosmology explains origin of universe, but because it occurred in the past it doesn’t predict anything about that past, evolution explains the diversity of organisms)
Guide Data Collection (any attempt at data collection relies on some model of what variables depend on one another)
Illuminate core dynamics (Models capture qualitative behaviors of general interest; All models are wrong and some are useful)
Suggest analogies (Different systems with similar mathematics can have analogous relationships, Black holes and laws of thermodynamics, springs and fields)
Discover new questions (Attempts to understand a model lead to new questions about nature)
Bracket possible outcomes or plausible ranges (Allows us to be explicit about what we do or do not know)
Promote a scientific habit of mind (Creating explicit models forces on to be explicit about what we do or do not know about a system, and about what assumptions are the most important)
Demonstrate tradeoffs (Provides a way to consider contingencies: i.e. if X happens then we have Y, but if X’ happens then we have Y’)
Expose the prevailing wisdom to be incompatible with data (calculation of the cosmological constant using quantum field theory reveals that quantum field theory as we understand it on a cosmological scale is incomplete)
Train practitioners (simple scenarios in which scientists in training can apply the concepts they’re learning and thus practice them: E.g., one-dimensional ising model teaches scientists about phase transitions)
Reveal the simple to be complex; the complex to be simple
*Addendum (if there’s time:) Missing Curriculum in Problem Solving Physics
Quotation about physics being useful as general education. 
Example of problem students are asked to solve
Discussion of where such problems fits in the missing curriculum
Return to modeling activity: Show how questions are always the starting point of any model (Use Nelson’s work with Crispr-Cas9 as an example and use the elevator problem as another example)
Review of Purposes (~ 5mins): 
Outline of Coming Weeks (~ 5mins)
Oct 9, no class but an assignment is due (Public and Technical Talk topic choices)
Oct 16, Group A public talks; Group B hands in abstracts
Oct 23, Group B public talks; Group A hands in abstracts
Oct 30, Group A technical talks; Group B hands in press release (Meetings to discuss talks)
Nov 6, Group B technical talks; Group A hands in press release (Meetings to discuss talks)
Nov 13, Discussing Making a Poster (Meetings to discuss talks)
Nov 21, Peer Review of Poster Outline (Meetings to discuss talks)
Nov 27, Poster Presentations in Physics Colloquium

as a foundation students list the purposes of a model. Students first discuss what characterizes research in physics. what characterizes research in physics. (Get four white boards and ~four dry erase markers from the physics library)
- Using this modeling exercises as a basis, ask students in groups of three or four to discuss what aspects of thinking or working characterize research in physics versus research in other disciplines AND what are the purposes of a model. 
- Go to your presentation: Bialek’s definition of biophysics; Venn diagram? what if anything can physicists contribute to biology?
- Go to the physics approach in life sciences: divide students into two groups and ask the pro group to construct an argument for using physics and ask the con group to construct an argument against using physics (try to get everyone to speak)
Bad way to do it: XKCD, Physics Envy
Back to the purposes of modeling: An expanded vision of modeling corrects for these faults (Also talking in the language of biologists)

Notes on Guan

I suppose this is a story that, in its essence, has been told many times. A story of closed doors and open windows, of opportunity and courage, of fear and fear’s subjugation. Many times while the story was being lived I reassured myself that there was in fact no story at all, that whatever I believed I understood was comprehension grounded in bad faith or poor analysis. My motto: “You know how this works. And the way this works is that you have no idea how this works.” The “this” being life, the “this” being all of the people and struggles we suffer through while believing there some larger meaning which will filter into our lives and reveal our pain to be as important to everyone else as it is to us. Baldwin tells me this belief is wrong. He says our pain has no purpose other than to connect us to other people’s pain and thus to liberate both parties from the belief that each is alone. Could this function self-referentially as well? I do not believe anyone other than myself will read these words, and so the person for whom these words will act as a key is no one other than myself, displaced from this moment by years or decades. What do I want him to know?

First, I met Guan about a week ago at the LGBTQ+ Social hour. It was the first LGBTQ+ social hour I attended in my three years at Harvard. It took great courage to attend. Great courage and great self delusion, for this is what I have learned about self-delusions: They can function to keep us safe (or seemingly so) from the world, wrapping us in stories which are neat and clean and thus, we believe, unassailable. Or self-delusions can make it possible to wake each day and walk through the world even when we find no will nor reason to do so. A year ago I attended one of these social hours. Or tried to. It was at Daedalus. I arrived early, but not too early, and sat alone at a table near a window. Many people came in and ordered drinks at the bar and I felt nervous and exposed. This, I remember now, was around the time Tony was departing to Miami. Why did I attend this event? Was I trying to find someone to replace him? I cannot remember my motivations, abstract as they always are. What is more clear is the concrete. With the noise and the people closing in on me, I began to panic, and less than ten minutes after entering I escaped out onto the street again. I remember feeling anger and shame. But also relief. 

Those moments were in my head as I walked to Queenshead on Thursday September 28th. I tried my best to push them away. I relaxed my cognition and struggled to turn off the constant hum of analysis which disassembled and reassembled the experiences of my day. For year such analyses had worked and worked to understand the people and institutions I occupied, but rarely did it find any deeper explanation of the world other than explanations pointing toward my own insecurities. I had always remembered that social hour a year ago as a terrible experience, one caused not by my own cowardice, but other people’s callousness. I had been alone and was trying to connect with other people. But everyone at Daedalus had seemingly come with a group, at once fortified and impregnable. Why had they—or why had the universe—not made it easier?

But I walked on toward Queenshead because I knew that this was the only path left open for what I wanted: to connect with men who had so thoroughly failed the basic criterion of masculinity (i.e., attraction to women) that they had to create for themselves a new ethos around which to build a life. 

It had been, I told myself, a difficult series of weeks for me. All of the people I had tried to connect with had seemed to slide into a limbo out of which I could not retrieve them. Over email, I had asked Courtney to dinner, and she never responded back. After a night with Elana, I asked her how a weekend trip, and was met with a weeklong silence. I had asked Mina when he wanted to watch a movie we had planned to see and he texted back days later. I was beginning to lose what little religion I had. Relationships, always conduits of pain and disappointment for me, were beginning to suggest that they could be seen as little else. 

And I had grown deeply tired of all of the apps. Days before Amy formally broke up with me, I signed onto Jackd and the week after she left I signed onto OKCupid. That pre-emptive foray into Jackd was a reactive move, one induced by my sense of Amy’s vacillations and my inability to walk quietly and maturely toward the inevitable end of our relationship. But I started OKCupid (or rather returned to it) in good faith. I had wanted to find the eponymous “someone” not to distract me from Amy, not to replace her, but to put into practice the lessons I had learned about intimacy and connection.  

But on Jackd I found Keizo, and little else. It is difficult to outline the nature of the conversations, the substructure of interactions on that app. People came and go as often as the turning of dusk to dawn and back again. But I cannot claim the victim here. There were many messages I did not respond to, many conversations which I, for whatever reason, decided to abdicate without explanation. This I suppose was the great damage that the app had done to me: a new standard of acceptable callousness. Some of the guys were lazy in their introduction. Some were explicitly sexual. All of these messages were easy to ignore. But other guys conveyed what I saw as a genuine interest to get to know the human behind the shirtless images. In their queries to me, I saw loneliness and its concomitant, desperation. But all the conversations eventually ended in the same place: Messages came and went for a few days, but after a time, I stopped responding. In spite of my desire to be polite, I eventually grew tired of interacting with people out of some misguided cordiality rather than legitimate interest. I was looking for something and these people were not it. 

On OKCupid I found less than nothing. I had been on the app before (a year ago, to be exact), and I left because I was becoming obsessive and it was eating into my work and life. Now, I saw the app doing something else. It was convincing me of the disposability of other people, the sheer pointlessness of empathy and concern. I came to the application with hope (one which was weak, I admit) and left with dejection and cynicism. In the few weeks I had used it, I had changed, had become a mirror to the culture I had previously disparaged. And moreover, the experience reified the gender dynamics of online dating in such a way that made me even less sympathetic of women’s role in heterosexual relationships. 

One good thing did come from the experience. A more confident sense of self. Strangely, it was easier than it had been a year ago to label myself as bisexual on the app. I knew, had always known, how women felt about bisexuality, but it was only after my relationship with Amy that I had become OK with the double standard. I knew women would disqualify me from their pool of desirables because I did not fit into the gender tropes they so often wished to be released from, but I also knew that the result was that both they and I would be freed from forcing to be people we could not be. 

And although the app had led me to recognize an expansion in my own humanity, I found it gradually blinding me to the humanity of others. I had initially promised myself that I would not use the “Hot” or “Not” feature, a feature which allowed you to swipe right or left to indicate interest or the lack of it. I had believed the simplicity of the swipe was disconcerting, something intangibly dehumanizing about making someone vanish by simply waving one’s finger like a wand. 

But an inability to find matches through the other features, convinced me to renege on this pledge. So, as a compromise, I promised myself I would use the feature with attention. I would not swipe mindlessly, but would take the time to read each profile deciding carefully if a connection beyond optics was possible. However, this too proved to require too much self-restraint. Soon, I began deciding, simply from the pictures alone, whether or not the person I saw was a person I wanted to connect with. In one of his comedy specials Aziz Ansari states that these “Hot” or “Not” features have just formalized a process we have engage in IRL. By his accounts, we go through our days silently saying “Yes” “No” “Yes” “No” to everyone, implicitly opening ourselves to some and closing ourselves to others. But what the apps contain that real life does not is premature finality, the limiting self-fulfilling prophecy that our first impression is the correct one. We swipe left and then we never have to consider the person again. And thus we miss the opportunities for the self-transformations which only come from realizing that the way we see the world and the people within is not the only way these things could be seen. 

If one were to write out the statistics of my swipes in those first few weeks, one would see many many men and very few women. Years ago, I had seen data on the number of messages women receive on these dating apps, and Amy also had told me that whenever she used the application, she always received more messages than she could reply to: Most of the men who contacted her, she had to ignore. Because I defined myself as bisexual, I was presented with both women and men on the application. But because of my knowledge of women’s response habits, whenever I was presented with a woman on the app, I did not see a potential for connection, but rather a potential for being ignored. In result I did not message or “like” any women, and in spite of claiming to be open to pursuing a romantic relationship with both women and men, I had chosen to interact only with men. 

There was also the fact that I did not think women would be interested in a bisexual man. Did I anticipate in microcosm something of what bisexual men have experienced in macrocosm over the course of their acknowledged existence? The question of male bisexuality has always been an insulting one to me. It is a question which requires the answerer to tangle with the underlying ignorance ever before an answer could be formulated. In a sentence, the libel of “bi today, gay tomorrow” has much more to do with everyone else’s misunderstanding of male sexuality than it does with a man’s misunderstanding of his own. Today the common female belief is that whatever truth men claim about their experiences should not be believed because men, unlike women, are blinded by the safe home they find in the stories our culture proffers about how they feel, think, and love. It is an uncomfortable truth of today’s modern feminism that many of the women who desire sexual and gender liberation do so under the premise that men need not be similarly liberated. And so I imagine myself in some nebulous future recognizing my attraction to both women and men, but only being with men because women are unwilling to accept the reality I claim is there.

The attention we pay to these hypocrisies is a function of both their flagrance and our ability to speak on them. But what if the nature of the hypocrisy itself tempers our ability to speak? What if the hypocrisy is that members of one group are not capable of full expression because they do not need it, and thus these members are effectively silenced by the common belief that they lack the desire to speak?

I have digressed. I was carping about disparities in the message rates for men and women. At this point clarity is in order. I am not claiming to be envious of the number of messages women receive. Rather I want the confidence such messages induce. I want to engage with the apps with the belief that my engagement would be reciprocated. I know that a woman likely has little interest in many of the men who message her, but this proliferation of messages, as opposed to the silence I experienced, gives the tacit signal that the woman has a choice, that she could look and possibly find, that she could speak and be responded to. The messages show that she is desired and thus give her confidence to express that desire to others. This is what I am envious of. 

Now, I am not so deluded as to not see the parallel between my ignoring of men on Jackd and women’s ignoring of me on OKCupid. Your hidden question: I previously rationalized my own seeming insensitivity. Can I not rationalize theirs? Of course, but I have no desire to protect some ill-defined sense of virtue in myself to only fail to recognize the pain my actions cause. It may be the structure of these apps which lead to a vast majority of queries for connection going unreciprocated, but it is a structure I and women willingly engaged in, and thus we cannot be rendered faultless simply because we did not write the script. 

So much of our senses of other people’s privilege and unearned rights come not merely from what these people have but what they have and what they have forgotten to value. It is what they take for granted which supplies the evidence of the crime. I knew this applied to me just as well, and yet I still felt that whatever probes of intimacy I felt on OKCupid or Jackd were not enough. 

It was the lackluster experience on both of these apps which convinced me that something needed to change. I had reached a plateau and I could try to search more carefully on this plane for what I as of yet could not find, or I could look up and learn to climb to the heights I saw in the distance. Meeting people online was not working, had seldom worked, but I had continued to do it because I believed—erroneously—that it was the only way. Rather, online dating was the only way to meet people while saving face, the way to do it without having to risk public humiliation by looking into the eyes of someone who did not wish to connect with me. But love requires risk, both at is inception and throughout its development. Those who do not want to risk anything cannot find anything, and this is a lesson I only learned from an intimate inspection of my own pain: No great truth about the human condition can ever be learned from a position of safety. 

Long ago, I had often wished women believed this, seeming as they always did to be content waiting to be saved from their safety. But now I have learned to do something better than wish. Now, I enact a plan: When I see a woman who appears to be interested in me, I steel myself. I watch and listen and see what she does with her interest, whether she has the courage to act on it in rebuttal to what she has been told she is supposed to do, or whether she stands passively by, waiting for the world to act on her. It is, in a way, a test to see how committed the woman is to the gender norms I roundly disagree with. Of course, my experience with Amy reveals that a woman who does not subscribe to such norms is not guaranteed to be a perfect partner. Still, this check is a good litmus test to see if such a relationship can ever get off the ground. Most women fail this test. They seem ever unwilling to step outside their bubbles of safety and pride to risk either in pursuit of a relationship. Instead, women usually just drop subtle hints that they want the man to take such risks for her, the implicit promise in such hints being that she will not humiliate him the way she fears he will humiliate her. Nowadays, these hints do little to move me because, in my experience, what they indicate—the woman’s lack of courage—says much more about her character than what I usually glean from that first conversation.

This is what led me to Queenshead that Thursday: The recognition that all other avenues had been explored and little had been found. What should I say about that night? I cannot fully render the nervousness and fear I felt at the outset. What I can render is sitting in front of Guan at the bar and feeling his leg rub agains mine and finding myself surprised at the brazenness and wishing him not to stop. He told me he was an undergraduate studying economics, but that he took a year off. He said he was an international student from China, that he was applying to consulting and finance jobs, that he wanted to travel to France, Spain, England. He was so uninhibited, so different from me. After maybe 20 minutes of talking I decided I wanted to get his number. But by then a crowd had formed around us, and the crowd remained. 

Simply coming to the social event took so much forced bravery that having arrived I should have felt satisfied for the night. But, here he was and I had no idea when our respective random walks throughout Harvard would bring us together again, and so I knew this was in a way my only chance. I had no idea if he was interested in me, but it didn’t seem to matter: I was drawn to him. With no one in the crowd leaving, I took advantage of a lull in the conversation to ask for his phone number. I gave him my phone and he typed his number and full name and handed it back to me. I put the phone back and we went on with the conversation. Why didn’t I text him back immediately just to make sure I had the number? Why did I wait until well after I left the bar? 

It was past 10pm, three hours since I first arrived, before the group of us left Queenshead. I went up the north stairs toward the chemistry building, and Guan and the others went up the south stairs. Before we parted ways, he turned back to me and said goodbye and I waved back. In my office in Mallinckrodt, I contemplated whether I should text the number Guan gave me. Should I wait until tomorrow? Was this too forward? I went for it with something simple: “Hi Guan. It’s Mobo (Mobolaji). Good meeting you tonight.” The message I received in reply was “Sorry, this service is not available.” Incredulously, I texted the number again and received the same message. 

What was happening? He had given me the wrong number? Did he do this on purpose? Was this my insecurity talking? I spent the next 30 minutes searching for him online, seeing if I could find an email address. I found a Linkedin account and a Researchgate account. I decided to try to contact him through his Researchgate account since it looked like it was updated most recently. I registered for my own account to get access to the internal messaging feature and then sent him a message saying that it was good meeting him that night. I explained that I was going through Researchgate because I couldn’t reach him through texts. Even with this caveat, to me the message seemed tinged with desperation. 

I waited. By the next morning, I still hadn’t received a reply. The afternoon and the evening and then the night passed similarly before I decided to try another tack. He must have been on the Harvard LGBTQ email list. Could I get his email address if I contacted one of the presidents and asked for it? Worth a shot. Fortunately, he had left me his full name. I emailed Kiera and asked her if I could get the email address of Guanchen Liao. This was in the late afternoon on Saturday. I didn’t receive a reply that night or the morning after. But, on Sunday, I ran into her on the way to Gutman library. I asked about the email, and she told me that the the group doesn’t give out student email addresses, especially since not all of the students are out. Instead she suggested I use Harvard’s directory to try to find his email address. How obvious. I hadn’t even considered this as an option. Five minutes later, I had an email address. I tried to make this first message simple while acknowledging the problems with the number:

Hi Guan,
It's Mobo. It was good meeting you at the social on Thursday. Thanks for your number as well, but it only has eight digits (206883960) so my texts haven't gone through. Or was this intentional and I should just take the hint ;)

Almost immediately, he responded back and he told me he forgot a last 0 in the number. Ahh, so it was my insecurity talking. I texted him later that night and asked him if he was free for a drink later that week. He said yes, and we met at Daedalus the next night. 

And so it had begun. In the days after the social, there were few hours when I did not think of him. Why? Why was I so intrigued by him after only a few hours of conversation? I did not know. Perhaps I could never know. But what could be resolved was whether my mind was attached to a much displaced image of who he was or something closer to reality. I could only determine this by seeing him again. So I told myself that even if we met and the meeting failed and there was no resonance or proverbial spark, at least I would be free of the nameless compulsion which had possessed me for the past few days. 

If only. Men are not often considered beautiful, but watching him and talking to him on the Daedalus roof deck on that chilly night of October 2, I fell into a trance. I was nervous and stuttery, but he seemed so relaxed. He had a right-lobed earring and a gray jacket. He was 24 years old. He told me about his day, what it was like living in the U.S. for three years, helping his mom to date, and the classes he was taking. Partly through the dinner I rubbed by knuckles against his knee and he didn’t move away. At some point, I placed an open hand on his leg. He didn’t flinch, didn’t even seem to register that I had done anything. Did this mean he was interested? Or just very passive? 

I eventually told him I was bisexual. He nodded his head in a way I could not interpret. I knew the legend that claimed gay men did not like dating bisexual men, and I wondered if it applied to him as well. On the table, he placed a glass on his left and a beer can on his right. “So on the spectrum from 100% gay,” he pointed to the glass, “to 100% straight,” he pointed to the beer can, “where are you?” I laughed. I told him it was not so easy. How attracted I was to a guy or a girl depended on the guy or the girl. He seemed to accept this. He then placed his finger 80% of the way toward the glass. “This is where I am.” I was surprised at his honesty. In our current culture, would other avowedly gay men ever admit to not being 100% gay? He told me a story about traveling with a girl, and noticing that she was attracted to him and that he was attracted to her. Nothing happened, but something could have. 

His first sexual experience was when he was 10. The first time he was penetrated was when he was 14. I wanted to but didn’t ask (yet) how many sexual partners he has had. I told him I have had eight (Tony, Dat, Andreas, Nicholas, Daniel, Amy, Keizo, Elana). But my definition was not the same as his. He defined sex penetratively, which would have meant I only had two partners, both women. Why hadn’t I had this kind of sex with men. I told him I had tried twice, but could not do it either time. Both times, I had failed “to perform” as they say. I needed, I explained, some emotional connection to the person in order to do it. “Ahh,” he said, “You’re a romantic.”

I must admit that in spite of my seeming acceptance of my sexuality, most of my sexual encounters with men have been tinged with shame. The end of the experience would always coincide with an end to the lust which precipitated it, and without the lust there was nothing keeping the self-loathing from view. Internalized homophobia was my simple explanation for these feelings of guilt, but now I have to entertain another. My experience with Guan suggests that it was not the act that I was ashamed of but the fact that the act was not supported by any deeper feelings of connection. Most of the awkward fumblings in the night were done, strangely enough, for themselves and not as an expression of something more. The sex with Tony, Dat, Nicholas, Daniel, Keizo— it all felt vaguely wrong perhaps because I had done it too soon for myself, done it before I felt the things for which it should have been an extension. 

But with Guan, every embrace, every touch, every kiss felt honest and clean. That first night, after our drinks in Daedalus, we walked through the hum of the night-fallen campus. He wheeled his bike with him and he was heading to Porter Square, but he agreed to walk part of the way. I wanted to stay with him as long as I could. We walked and walked until we reached the corner of Oxford and Everett. There he put his bike on a stand and opened his arms wide for a hug. I moved in and wrapped my arms around his body. I breathed him in and out and in again, and when I moved away I kissed his neck, then his cheek, and then his lips. The night had been incredible, and I wanted to see him again, but I knew how these things worked: Every moment was a premonition of the end, each first was potentially also a last. So if this was to be simply a special night, I would get from it what I could. But as I kissed him, the pressure of his lips and the grip of hands indicated that I was not alone in feeling…something. I think we stood on that block for a minute our bodies and lips together in the glow of street lights.

Maybe my problems with all the existing dating apps is that they try to accelerate a process which, for me, cannot be accelerated. It is difficult meeting people IRL, so difficult that a shortcut seems necessary. Instead of working through the slow and uncertain process of seeing people in the world, speaking with them, and learning over time whatever will become of your relationship, we seem to want guarantee from the beginning that this interaction is leading to something. This is what OKCupid provides. People’s desires, their wants, what they are “looking for” are all explicitly stated, and thus users can engage in an exercise of self-delusion where they believe people can be fit neatly into the self-selected criteria, where they can believe they have nothing to gain from interrogating the criteria themselves. 

If I had seen Guan on Jackd I probably would not have messaged him. In all the pictures of him I’ve found online he’s smiling, gregarious in a way I cannot help but distrust. But in person, he evinces a personality impossible to read from his pictures. Speaking to him and looking at him, it is the neutrality of his expression which I find most captivating. He asked me what issues I cared about (he cares about education and politics and religion and he has many opinions about all three). After our conversation in Daedalus, I realized he was far from being the “un-serious person” I would have assumed he was had I only seen a profile and a short description.  

The afternoon after Daedalus I texted him and asked if I could see him again. Wednesday night, an agonizing 36 hours later, he replied. Was he trying to tell me he wasn’t interested? During that first date, I told him that I had been in two relationships. He, strangely, had not been in any. If I were seeing straight (so to speak), I would see this admission as a red flag, a clear indication that any stability I hoped to find in him after this first date was illusory. But, again, I was mesmerized. He asked why did my relationships end. I told him about Tony and his disappearance. How would you end a relationship, I asked him, if you were no longer interested in the person. He smiled. “You’re traumatized,” he said. After a beat he explained that he does not ignore texts, but that if he wasn’t really interested in a guy he would wait at least 24 hours before texting him back. Persistent as I am, would this work on me?

In the text Wednesday night, he apologized. He wanted to work out his schedule before he replied. We could have lunch tomorrow. He would buy me a burrito from Felipe’s, but more importantly I would get to see him again. Thursday afternoon, we sat at the first table at Felipe’s. He told me about his class with Larry Summers and a seminar where Christine Lagarde came to speak. He was invested in the world around him in a way that I was not. All of which added more to his allure. 

That lunch, I suppose, was our second date. But the formality of that label sounds wrong to me. Being around him felt freeing, as if all day I had been carrying some burden and could only set it down in his presence. Our third date, was later that same day in Queenshead. The last date was a pottery class he invited me to on Friday which included dinner afterwards. Each date ended in a kiss. The last one ended in something more. After the dinner on Friday, we rode our bikes to the Harvard Business school. So late at night the campus was deserted. At some point, in the yellowed flood lights of the courtyard, I grabbed his arm and pulled him toward me kissing him. We kept kissing and kissing. I invited him back to Parkdale street. He said yes.

For: First Class Last Rites
At the front of the room stepped Adekunle, class of 2005. Now (Legend had it that) this negro had more degrees than a thermometer and he was still gaming for more. He had graduated from the Institute, went on to get a masters, completed an MD/Ph.D, and was now working on a law degree (JD) to move into patent law for a medical technologies firm. I wanted to ask him what the point of all that education was. Couldn’t he save some time and some space on his C.V. and just write “I’m really good at school”? 


Notes for “A Model of Mismatched Pairs”
Questions
Are DNA base pair mismatches typically unstable? http://www.atdbio.com/content/15/Mutagenesis-and-DNA-repair#Mismatches-in-DNA-bases
When computing the free energy of dsDNA with mismatches, can we approximate the free energy as arising solely due to the correctly matched pairs?
The calculations of Delta G are all temperature dependent, but in our model gamma_i is temperature independent. Can we use these temperature dependent values of Delta G in our model?

I think you should change the narrative at the end. Instead of just providing an example calculation, you can show why the assumption that thermal fluctuations are relevant in defining the system. If the micro state cannot change, the system (as evidenced by its reality) admits a much lower level of thermal fluctuations. 


in changing the micro state is so important in the system. In realistic systems of dsDNA the sys

Missing the Point

A year ago my Director of Graduate Studies asked me a question that I should have known the answer to. “What is the most important experimental development in your field from the past 10 years?” This was not a quiz. It was a segue. We had been talking about developments in experimental physics, and we started talking about biophysics. I looked back, stupefied for seconds, before saying something about single molecule trapping or neural control of mice. He shook his head. “Crispr-Cas9.” He went on to describe this seemingly miracle procedure which allowed scientists to manipulate genes almost as if they were creating a patchwork quilt/almost as if they were if typing base-pairs on a screen. I had never heard of it before. 

It is easier to explain to people what I do than what I am, because there is less truth in the latter and I can’t get past that fact.

Notes from: 
Popper: “A theory is only scientific if it is empirically falsifiable.” 
— This is perhaps a solid definition of science. But is it a solid definition of useful knowledge? Can we equate what we think of as “science” with what we consider to be useful knowledge?

His addendum: “We have a good theory of science, (i.e., something scientists should continue working on), if it is refutable, risky, problem-solving, and has stood up to successive attempts at refutation. In other words, it must be highly falsifiable, but (thus far) unfalsified.”
— The problem with this characterization is that falsified is rendered as a sort of all or nothing thing. Science is a work in progress, an so it is not clear until well after another theory supplants it, that an original theory has been falsified. In other words, I think one can list many “good” theories of science that we reject not because they have been thoroughly falsified but because we prefer another theory. (Examples?)

Popper: Had two standards: Whether something is scientific and whether it represents good science. Something is scientific if it is empirically falsifiable. Something represents good science according to how much it has been falsified. 

Lakatos: “All theories are born refuted and die refuted.” Non-science of pseudo-science is at one end of a continuum with the best science at the other end. A research program exists somewhere on the continuum and it can begin as genuinely scientific while degenerating into something less scientific over time. 

Examples
o Newtonian Gravity and the Precession of Mercury: mathematicians and physicists did not reject newtonian gravity even though it was not consistent with the precession of mercury. 
o Copernican Heliocentrism and Stellar Parallax: astronomers did not reject the idea that earth revolved around the sun even though they did not observe stellar parallax for many centuries (the fact that the position of some stars should vary according to where the earth is in its orbit around the sun)
=> Conclusion: “If scientists often persist with ‘refuted’ theories either the scientists are being unscientific or Popper is wrong about what constitutes good science, and hence about what scientists ought to do.”

Lakatos’s goal was to develop a better definition of scientific practice. 

He first defined a scientific theory as consisting of a hard core of a ideas and a set of auxiliary hypotheses. The hard core of ideas are supposed to be irrefutable in the practice of science, while the auxiliary hypotheses connect the hard core of ideas to observable reality. 
— This seems very similar to your discussion on the structure of scientific theories. Make sure you cite Imre Lakatos if you ever write something about this.

Notes from “The Uncomfortable Truth about Campus Rape,” https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/09/the-uncomfortable-truth-about-campus-rape-policy/538974/ by Emily Yoffe
Even so, in a February op-ed, Carol Quillen, the president of Davidson College, wrote that while “criminal justice is founded on due process and the possibility of innocence,” ideals she valued, these goals were inherently in conflict with other important goals. “Nothing about due process says to a rape survivor, ‘I believe you,’” she wrote.
— Yoffe “The Uncomfortable Truth about Campus Rape Policy,”


We cannot presume to know the answer., rather what we should strive for is a better way to frame the question. 

The archetypical image of a campus sexual predator is not true to statistics. The image popularized by Brock Turner—one of a rich, white, fraternity athlete—does not mirr
In the 2013-14 school year at Colgate university, black students 

The archetypal image of a campus sexual predator—a rich, white, fraternity athlete— one popularized by Brock Turner is not true to statistics. In the 2013-14 school year at Colgate university, black students made up 4.2% of the student population but black male students comprised 50% of the accused in sexual assault cases.
—Statistics are better over a three year period: from 2012-2015 black male students comprised 25% of the accused in sexual assault cases. 

In a case at the University of Amherst in the Spring of 2016, a student (Kwadwo) was on track to graduate with a degree in chemical engineering. He had a sexual encounter with a white female student in which (a retelling suggests) he was largely the passive participant. The female student later claimed to have felt violated and spoke to her dean to file a sexual assault charge against Kwadwo. The student also informed the police. The police investigated and closed the cases with no charges. The school (presumably under the direction of the dean), informed Kwadwo that a very serious allegation had been filed against him and that he was barred from speaking to the female student, could not attend any dormitories other than his own, and could not be part of the student union. This meant he could not continue playing with a jazz ensemble that met on Sundays. 

He was also warned not to talk about the allegation with anyone. The female student later filed a claim that Kwadwo had violated one of these regulations. This prompted the university to ban him from university housing: he would have to commute to campus. 

When Kwadwo tried to use a minority student group to attest these claims, the university, after learning of his doing so, banned him from campus entirely. 

People who question the legitimacy of these policies are said to be “blaming the victim.” It is in a way similar to labeling someone racist or sexist in that it is a tool to end an argument. 

Notes from the Meeting
The Social Justice Tuesdays group just finished our discussion on Betsy DeVos and Title IX. As it so happens, we talked very little about DeVos and talked almost entirely about Title IX. I was the contrarian in the discussion. Prompted by a statement from Kate about Campus sexual assault policy, I introduced some points (mostly outlined above) from Yoffe’s article on “The Uncomfortable Truth about campus Rape Policy.” I would like to say everyone was floored by the clarity of my recycled arguments and immediately realized all the problems with their assumptions, but this was not so. What were these assumptions? Well the main one was that DeVos’s rollback of Title IX regulations is a terrible federal regulation (or deregulation?) and that it reveals the Trump administration’s indifference to sexual assault and women. The other assumption was that most if not all claimed victims of sexual assault are indeed true victims. 

Abby, ever the faithful liberal, explained that colleges must take into account our culture as they adjudicate sexual assault cases, and since we live in a rape culture, that is a culture where men (mostly) are constantly committing sexual assault against women (mostly), universities absolutely should adopt a lower standard of evidence in deciding these cases. She likened this lower standard of evidence to affirmative action policies. In the latter case, she argued that it makes sense that a university, when considering two applicants with the same academic ability, would choose the student who is an underrepresented minority since the minority has historically been discriminated against. I was not clear what the parallel to sexual assault was in this case. Is it that universities, when given a choice between a lower and a higher standard of evidence in sexual assault cases should choose the lower standard of evidence due to the history of unreported sexual assault? Or, more insidiously, that when a woman files a sexual assault claim against a man, she should always be believed over the man’s defense?

My main point was that the Obama administration had scared colleges into adopting sexual assault policies which did not give adequate rights to the supposed perpetrator, infantilized the victim, and did not at all led clarity or comfort to a process which by the nature of the precipitating event was naturally murky and uncomfortable. Thus colleges adopted policies to protect them from legal recusal from the federal government. Such was the policy described in Yoffe’s article. Abby rejected this claim. She wanted to know whether all universities regulated sexual assault in the ass-backward (my word) way described in my example. I did not know. Kate mentioned some Crimson articles which described the process. 

Over the course of the discussion, I realized that Abby and I were reasoning from two opposing sets of assumptions. She assumed (I’m guessing) that not enough sexual assault cases are reported and those which are reported do not levy sufficient reprimand on the perpetrator. I assumed that many college women did not themselves know how to define consent and thus labeled sexual encounters as rape based on their feelings after the event rather than any consistent definition one could enforce. By these assumptions, it is not surprising that I took the position that the previous Title IX guideline calling for “a preponderance of evidence” was an insufficient standard of evidence and she took the position that it was sufficient, and possibly even too high. 

But beyond these positions, the more interesting question is where did the assumptions underlying them come from? Now, she is a white woman, and I am a black man. If the statistics of sexual assault were to bear out in each of our lives, she would mostly like be a victim of an assault and I the perpetrator. Were we then simply adopting the assumptions which were most relevant to ensuring our own safety?  I can only speak for myself, and I will admit this is at least approximately correct. But for me there is a larger (or rather different) concern, something not having to do with my future role in a sexual assault, but my past experiences with women. 

I guess this is the primary benefit of a discussion with someone you disagree with. By the end of the conversation, neither of you is likely to the change positions and their antecedent in identity which took years to solidify, but at least with some introspection these positions and identities are put in greater relief.   You may not escape the cage, but at least you see it more clearly. 

But I have known my position for years: By experience or personal weakness, I do not implicitly trust women. By implicit trust I mean that proverbial sentiment of confidence called “the benefit of the doubt.” Namely if a woman were to tell me that something terrible happened to her in her life, would my immediate mental reaction be to believe her or wonder internally whether she misinterpreted the situation? For years, I’ve known my own position out of these two. What surprised me as the discussion went one was how strongly I held onto this position. 

Women represent “the other” for me, and so this distrust could be seen as basically human. But, to be complete, I must admit that I do not implicitly trust men either. I don’t implicitly trust anyone. Indeed, I don’t think anyone really does. Really, I does not seem possible to live in this world while cognizant of people’s large and small scale duplicities, and still come away believing that any anonymous person deserves implicit trust. But what seems especially problematic about my lack of implicit trust for women is that it exists in stark contrast to this society’s rendering of them as largely innocuous, defenseless, and constantly harangued human beings. 

My experience with women has decidedly not been in this capacity, so in the modern liberal arenas in which women can do no wrong, I constantly find myself ideologically displaced from my cohort. In fact my experience with women has not been with their impotence, but rather with their claimed impotence in the presence of a power made ever more affecting due to its obscurity. A power that they used with little responsibility, either because they wanted to perpetuate the illusion that they did not have it or because they really believed they didn’t. 

Am I making more out of this than it really is? As it stands my closest friends at Harvard are by and large women. I do not really understand why. Is it because I am trying to duplicate the relationship I had with my sister? Or is it because, after four years in a fraternity, I have had enough of the faux-masculinity most men cannot help but evince when more than two of them come together? It is not clear. What is clear is that my feelings about women do not play out in reality as one would assume they would. Then again this sounds a little too much like the white man claiming he is not racist because he has black friends. The question of whether someone is racist, or sexist, or homophobic is never a useful one. What is better is to interrogate how the worldly consequences of these labels play out in the individuals life. I can decidedly say that I am sexist, and that I am misogynistic, and, moreover, I can say these things without hiding behind the true claim that I am the product of a sexist and misogynistic culture. But these statements in of themselves are not the first step to whatever progress I hope to achieve by admitting them. Instead the first step is finding an answer to the question that I would ask the white man with all of his black friends. I am less concerned about how you see (or how you think you see) these particular friends. What is more pressing (and what is the place from which any growth you may find can come), is how do these particular friends see and feel about you. 

If I am to escape—or at least better understand—the nature of my distrust, this is the question I will need to answer.

The Laws of Thermodynamics

In Judy Swan’s video lecture on “Scientific Writing: Beyond Tips and Tricks”, she mentioned as an aside a cute way to encapsulate three laws of thermodynamics. 

First Law: You can’t win. You can only break even
(You cannot create energy. The best you can do in a local system is to conserve energy.)
Second Law: You can only break even at absolute zero.
(The entropy of the universe increases in time. Thus, within your system, most energy transformations result in an increased entropy of the universe and a decreased amount of useful energy for work in your system. Energy transformations which don’t decrease the amount of useful energy only occur when entropy is irrelevant which itself only occurs at absolute zero. As an aside, we should not you always break even when you consider the universe at large. It is only in your local system (typically called the “reservoir”) that you don’t break even. )
Third Law: You can’t reach absolute zero.
(It is impossible to reach zero temperature in a finite number of steps.)

The zeroth law, which is like a transitive property of thermal equilibrium, doesn’t seem to have such a pithy formulation. 

I need to remember to use this representation whenever I teach a thermodynamics course. 

“Bad scientific writing is writing that requires a disproportionate amount of the writers energy simply to figure out what it’s all about.”

The Structure of Empathy

October 25, 2017 — Wednesday 9:57PM

From the Physics 95 dinner today, Adam Cohen mentioned that one of the most interesting recent papers he’s read is Alan Turing’s “The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis.” Apparently, in the paper, Turing shows that a two dimensional diffusion equation with a nonlinear term can yield patterns like spots and stripes akin to what you see on a leopard or a tiger. Adam Cohen noticed that five days before Turing’s work was published Hodgkin and Huxley published an identical equation describing the voltages and Ca2+ concentrations in neurons. Cohen’s questions was whether it was possible to create and observe similar patterns (to the spots and stripes) in neuronal systems. The verdict is still out on this. 

Hi Parth, 

Here are some topics you could choose for your second talk. These all focus on science and would allow you to practice presenting a technical topic to a non-technical audience. You of course do not need to choose any of these, but hopefully they’ll give you a sense of the kind of topics you can choose. 


More Basic Topics
Machine Learning Basics: What is the basic implementation of a machine learning algorithm? Why are so many scientists currently interested in Machine Learning? How is it different from standard statistical methods like linear regressions?

Quantum Computing Basics: What is a quantum computer and how is it different from a classical computer? Are quantum computers currently overhyped?

Formation of Black Holes: Last year’s discovery of gravitational waves arose from the collision of two black holes. But how do black holes form. This topic would describe the process through which a star becomes a black hole

More Ambitious
Statistical Physics of Self Replication (http://www.englandlab.com/uploads/7/8/0/3/7803054/2013jcpsrep.pdf)
— England uses thermodynamic arguments to establish constraints on the heat released during replication. This allows him to determine how the properties of replicating systems relate to their theoretically optimal properties. There has already been a lot of press on this topic (just search “england” and “theory of life” ), but much of it has been sensational. 

Black Scholes Equation and Financial Mathematics
— The Black Scholes Equation is often considered the archetypal model of financial mathematics and thus it was an easy target for those who sought to criticize the quantitative techniques used in the financial crisis. Discussing either the Black Scholes equation or financial mathematics in general would be an interesting topic. (https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/12/black-scholes-equation-credit-crunch)(https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/02/13/black-scholes-didnt-cause-the-financial-crash/#5c8b385d58d9)

Recent improvements to Crispr
— A recent group has (apparently!) found a way to modify the Crispr procedure so that it edits specific bases rather than cutting out specific genes. Discussing Crispr in general and then the new procedure in particular might work as a topic. (https://www.nature.com/news/crispr-hacks-enable-pinpoint-repairs-to-genome-1.22884) (https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaap/ncurrent/full/nature24644.html)

He currently works in Harvard’s chemistry department studying the statistical physics of simple biomolecules. He spent the previous summer teaching the physics of oscillations and waves to high school students. This is the third summer he has been part of Harvard’s summer school, but the first summer he has taught his own course in the program.

Hi SJFers, 

Apologies for the lateness of this. I had trouble choosing a topic. The topic I went with is whether 

Has modern internet usage affect/changed the way we empathize with others?

Has the internet affected the way we communicate with and relate with friends?

Does this change in empathy affect our ability to relate to people different from us?

Is Twitter a good way of relating experiences and conveying empathy. 

The hope is that we can take something away from this discussion which will change (or at least help us better understand) the way we use information technology. 

Is shaming on social media the best way to sexual harassment

Update syllabus with a picture depicting the course
- Affirm that you can or cannot make certain dates for the course
You can at most have two speakers for the course; The course is primarily being taught by you; speakers are compensated otherwise
During the summer there is an Academic Honors Lecture Series paying 250 bucks a pop to speakers
If you have two many students you can get a TA which pays $1000
Previous year students complained about receiving too little homework
You can give lab tours of other professors labs you have the hours a week
It is recommended that you hold at least three office hours a week

I remember reading a biography of Feynman and learning that he did not go to Harvard because of the antisemitism prevalent in the institution. Instead he went to MIT bastion for young jewish student (almost exclusively men) to study without the pressure of the external prejudice. I remember being enamored by the idea that MIT could be a safe haven for those people our country had marginalized arbitrarily. Perhaps I too could be saved. 

But of course Feynman was Jewish and I was not. And I was black and Feynman was not. And thus the institution which saved Feynman perhaps could not save me. And MIT’s views on race bore the mark of the country in which it existed.

Nov 12 2017 — Sunday 5:18 PM
NSBP and James Gates
Last weekend I attended the National Society of Black Physicists Conference. There I met Jim Gates and got to speak with him for about an hour about his experiences at MIT. He told me he was part of the first class of interphase and that he had entered MIT in the fall of 1969, the year when 50 African American undergraduates were admitted to the incoming class; a number much larger than the admission rates in previous years. This apparently was part of a push to integrate the university. Professor Gates told me many stories about that incoming class. He said that many of his classmates were crazy. One classmate was enamored by trains and had dug a tunnel underneath some tracks in Boston so he could be right underneath the train when it passed by. Another classmate had taken apart and reassembled a car in his dormitory room. I asked Professor Gates if Boston was a racist city back then. He affirmed this. He said he was from the southern U.S. (I can’t remember which state), and that although there was clear racism there, there were also clear social boundaries so that people stayed “on their side” so to speak. But in Boston the boundaries were less clear. He told me of a time that he and his friends had driven through South Boston and that the residents on their stoops shouted racial slurs at them.

The last story I can remember is him telling me of the summer after his freshman year when he retaught himself the material from 18.03. I think he had taken 18.03 and 18.02 concurrently the previous spring, but that he still wanted to learn more about differential equations. His work led him to consider a modified version of the Bessel equation where there is a linear x term added to the factor multiplying the function y. He said he explored asymptotic solutions, series solutions, and all matter of techniques in trying to solve this differential equation, and when he returned to school in the fall he found many of his solution methods in a text in the library. Little of what he had done was new, but since he had done it on his own, it had told him that he did not have to rely on other people to teach him things. 

When Professor Gates told me this story I thought back on my many nights spent learning calculus and quantum mechanics on my own. I had also had an eye-opening experience the spring semester of my freshman year at MIT, when I had learned that prior sense of my limitations were inaccurate. 

Oh, I also met Milton Slaughter at the conference. He had sworn he had met me before, but I was sure he hadn’t. He told me that the UNO physics department is not at all like what it used to be. He apparently also knew Kevin Stokes.

Statistical Physics of Mismatched Pairs
I recently realized that the Statistical Physics of Mismatched Pairs problem would need to be expanded in order to connect it to a physical system. The problem as it previously existed was tightly constrained to Barbara Margolius’s original bridge couples problem. In the abstracted language in which I discussed it, I imagined 2N subunits each of which formed a pair with another subunit. There were N, non-overlapping, favorable pairing of subunits (e.g., 1 with N+1, 2 with N+2, and so on), and a statistical physics model could be built where the energy of the system was proportional to the number of unfavorable pairings. 

The problem with this model as it is applied to a biological context is that biomolecules that can exist in pairs do not always exist in pairs. Thus, one would need to include dissociated subunits in the state space of the system. To be complete one should also consider the volumes these subunits occupy, but as a first analytical problem it is OK to ignore volume. 




The setup of the problem could be as follows say there. There are  subunits in the system. Say that for a particular microstate of the system, we have  pairs (and  unpaired subunits) and of these pairs only  are favorable pairings. The remaining  pairs are unfavorable. In order to find the degeneracy factor for this microstate we need to determine the number of ways to select  subunits  subunits such that we form  pairs only  of which are favorable pairings. Presuming we find this degeneracy factor, which we label as , and noting that the energy benefit for an unfavorable pairing is   and the energy benefit for a favorable pairing is , the partition function for the system should be 

	Eq. 1

This is the partition function for distinguishable dissociable pairs with a hierarchy of energies (I really need to think of a better name). If we set the energies  and  equal to one another, then we reduce to the problem of distinguishable dissociable pairs with a single energy. This allows us to establish the identity 

 	Eq. 2
 
From here I was somewhat stuck in determining . I’ve argued two different forms and comparison with this condition revealed that they were both wrong. BUT, after a long walk, I’ve made some progress. First, one should note that for  (that is all the subunits have formed pairs), we should get the original favorable contact model. That means we should find 

	Eq. 3

where  is the number of unfavorable pairs, and given  people initially paired in some way,  is the number of ways the people can be re-paired so that no person is with his or her original partner. This limiting cases suggests that the best way to present this problem (at least for the purposed of deriving the degeneracy factor), is in terms of , the number of unfavorable pairs. 

The number of ways to select  subunits  subunits such that we form  pairs of which only  pairs are favorable, can be found as follows. We first ask what is the number of ways we can select  pairs out of a set of  pairs. This is simply  choose . Then we ask what is the number of ways we can choose  pairs out of a set of  pairs, such that all of these  pairs are unfavorable. Multiplying these two quantities gives us the degeneracy for a particular microstate defined by  total pairs and  unfavorable pairs. Summing this product from  to  yields the identity



where  is the number of ways to select  unfavorable pairs out of  pairs. We note that for , we have . Therefore finding the partition function for this system boils down to finding : Given  people initially paired in some way,  is the number of ways  of these people can be repaired so that no person (in this collection of  people) is with his or her original partner. 

How can I find this pivotal factor?
— I can work through Margolius’s paper and try to derive this factor for this new case. 
— I can post this problem on stack exchange and implore someone to solve it. 

I am going to do both.

Dinner Dining Match Problem 

“ A deck has n kinds of cards, 4 of each kind. The deck is shuffled and dealt in to n hands with 4 cards each. A match occurs for every card in the j-th hand of kind j. A(n) is the number of ways of achieving no matches. The probability of no matches is A(n)/((4n)!/4!^n).“

Lost in the World of Intimacy
I think it is human to purse that which makes one feel most alive. Therefore, what one should interrogate is not the pursuit itself but what is pursued, at what altars do we proffer our energy and time as some bribe for future rewards? If the stories I had told myself about my pain and my loves were true, then I would by now know in what things I could place my faith. The story goes that finding no semblance of consistency and no bedrock of reason in the world of man, I turned to the world of logic to save me from fitting myself into the contradictions of my communities. Thus came the hours in cloistered spaces with walls of shelves of books of pages rising and rising above me and extending beyond where I could see. Thus came the independence. Thus came the loneliness. 

All of this was induced by a world everyone else had made and in which I was forced to reside. 

So I believed. Now, I can in general commiserate with those who find the proverbial world keeping them away from the lives they want to live, but I cannot commiserate with my past conviction that all my cages were made by other people. I had known that none of my decisions about intimacy and connection were my own and that the life I had built was like a house assembled from branches and trees scattered by a storm: It was livable, it was tolerable, but it was (due to what I saw as circumstance) far from ideal. More honestly, I made decisions, decisions reified by what I saw as my spectrum of options and the limits of my agency but my decisions nonetheless. 

And I can admit this now, because the boundary between what I have decided and what has been imposed on me has recently been in flux. My sense of the relationships I can have, the people with whom I can connect, the life I could possibly live has expanded over the past year. With Amy, with Keizo, with Guan, with Elana. All of a sudden, the dreams I cultivated in my youth and later abandoned, have returned with new characters and new plots. And I am now faced with the question, a question that I thought my circumstance had preemptively answered for me long ago: Will I pursue intimacy or will I pursue order?

At the start of this year, I was sure this was a false question, one which presented as dichotomous two things which could in fact be reconciled. Since then, I have been trying to live the compromise and I cannot say I have been successful. Driven by a desire for intimacy, I forget my work and strive to be worthy of the relationships which I soon conclude are not worthy of me. Driven by a desire for order, my work becomes my world, but loneliness always leaks in to transform that world into an indistinguishable gray. And any measure of success in one domain always seems to inspire me to explore the other, so that question is never resolved: I bounce back and forth from one answer to the next, believing I am converging to some deeper truth and yet always finding myself once more believing the exact opposite of what I used to believe. 

What seems to arbitrate the contest is what I feel in each space. In the world of order, when I struggle and think and stop and walk and eventually come to the end of it all with a new understanding of something, I find myself propelled high above the clouds cresting my circadian cycles and all of a sudden I can see the world anew, and it, for those short moments of flight, appears to be a beautiful thing. The caveat of course is that this feeling is time limited. It must be renewed again and again because the insights which made life appear so radiant yesterday, soon descend below the clouds and become part of the furniture of a life that I often only tolerate. 

In the world of intimacy, if I were to be honest, I would admit that I have at times been similarly propelled by certain people. And if I were to be even more honest, I would also admit that it is fear of rebuff which would keep me from believing it can all happen again. A fear which seems to be the counterpart of the grey I find in the world of order. 

For much of the past few months I have been running away from this grey, and running headlong into a world of people and color, which seemed so enrapturing before but now appears indistinguishable from bedlam. If years from now, I look back on the fall of 2017 and I ask myself what happened to the promises I had made myself, let it be known that I was distracted because I let myself be distracted. Drunk on sentiment, reeling from passion, terrified of being alone, I chased those who had no interest in chasing me. And by making the apathetic and the subtly hostile my altars, I was in a way paying a penance for my faithlessness, being punished by my own weakness for the things I had abandoned. 

So what is this? An admission of guilt and a promise to do better next time? Of course not. How could it be? The spectrum of options have not changed and their influence on me remains similarly static. And what power does understanding (not to mention one so incomplete as my own) have in the face of habits, weakness, and cupidity? 

No, there are no promises here: This is simply the first step, an acknowledgment of what has been happening, of what could continue to happen if I don’t manage to cobble up a solution. Any true change arising from this will be small and unsexy, consisting of incremental changes meted out each day, changes in what I choose to pay attention to, to which people I choose to give my time. I will not complete this journey today, but today I can choose to start it. 

You have to make the decisions you need to make in order to live the life you must live so that you become the person you want to be.

Dissociable Pairs
So I solved the problem I previously mentioned, and I didn’t even have to go to stack-exchange. Actually, I did go to stack-exchange, but I didn’t ultimately post the problem. As I was drafting the question and trying my best to clarify the structure of a possible solution and the constraints it needed to satisfy, I realized that the final formula should mirror the formula for the number of deranged matchings in a set of N pairs. Using the principle of exclusion you can find formulas for both cases. Just recapping the question I was trying to find  defined as follows 

Given a set of  objects initially arranged in pairs,  is the number of ways to choose  new pairings such that none of the pairs are one of the original pairings. 

After working through some examples, I found the solution 



Consistent with their definition, the  coefficients satisfy  and , where  is Margolius’s formula for the number of deranged pairings of N couples (i.e., 2N people) initially paired and then rearranged into new pairs. 

Next, I found that these coefficients could be written as an integral:



I sought an integral form because such a form would be necessary to employ Laplace’s method to the partition function and  find the order parameters. After some work, I was able to show that this integral yielded an integral for the partition function. The result was 

,
where 



and 

.

In these expressions,  is the binding energy for an unfavorable pairing and  is the binding energy of a favorable pairing. The average number of pairings  and the average number of favorable pairings  can be found through the definitions 

        and       

I would want to plot both of these quantities as a function of temperature for , and for four different regimes for energies 

(i) small  and small  (small binding energy and small relative favorable binding energy; easy to dissociate and indifferent to favorability)
(ii) large  and small  (Large binding energy and small relative favorable binding energy; hard to dissociate and indifferent to favorability)
(iii) small  and large  (small binding energy and large relative favorable binding energy; only easy to dissociate unfavorable pairings)
(iv) large  and large  (large binding energy and large relative favorable binding energy; difficult to dissociate and very desirous of favorability)

It would also be quite cool if I can find analytic formulas for these results and thereby find some temperature characterizing transitions in the system.

Faith and Mathematics

When I told Amy about my thermal permutations work and my attempt to find the integral form of the  partition function, she told me that she admired that I had faith I would find a clean analytic result. I remember this sounding strange to me: Of course there would have been a clean analytic result. Why wouldn’t there be? But in retrospect, I did not always think this way. My first analytic solution of the problem came in March/April of 2016 and it was not an integral; it was a series which I only reduced to an integral months later. When I first found the series, I was quite satisfied with it. I had originally pursued a partition function reducible to a single function, but when I obtained the series I was so awed that it even existed that I decided to count my blessings and not look too deeply for anything more. However, I suppose there was faith in this search for the series, even if there was not full faith that something laid beyond it. 

I’m thinking about this now because days ago I derived the coolest piece of mathematical ass I have ever derived, and much of the derivation relied on faith that the final integral could be found. I’m talking about the partition function for dissociable and distinguishable pairs with favorable and unfavorable contacts. The work began a month ago while I was writing up the mismatched pairs notes. I realized the model did not make sense unless the subunits could exist outside of their favorable or unfavorable pairs. I spent the next month, wandering around mathematical waters which finally led to the question which opened all subsequent doors this week. The question was:

In how many ways can you choose k pairs from  N originally paired couples, so that none of these k pairs consist of one of the original pairings. 

Such a simple statement and I only had to walk to MIT to get it. That walk was profitable in other ways I suppose because while I clarified the pivotal question on the way there, I thought of ways to answer it on the way back. These were the  two options I mentioned above: ask the internet or work it out myself. If I asked the internet I was being a lazy mathematician. If I tried to work it out myself I could lose valuable time which would have been better spent analyzing the implications of this purely mathematical puzzle. These musings proved moot since I ended up doing both: I worked out the solution and then I posted the question (and my solution) online. I think I did this all on Wednesday. The following day, the day which led to the result this essay is concerned with did not feel as promising. 

The night I derived this fateful partition function was not an excellent one. I started the day well enough by going to the gym, attending a talk on diffusion through gels, going to Yoruba class and recording a make up theatre night presentation, and then visiting HUHS to see the therapy dogs. I had dinner with Victor at the Law School and then I went to the Harvard wide LGBTQ social hour at the Law school bar. I had been looking forward to the night for about a week. It would be my chance to meet and talk to people in person and hopefully build friendships which would lead to something more. But when I went there, the bar was crowded with people. I spoke to five people, but soon I became hot and sticky and claustrophobic, and I left 15 minutes after I had arrived. I had gotten no one’s contact information. I had made nothing of what seemed like lasting contact. Outside Caspersen, the campus was damp and couples huddled together against the cold. Walking down the crossed pathways of the Law school quad, I looked up and saw a lattice work of room lights coming from Jefferson. I looked up to where the physics library was and saw that this light too was on. I imagined myself two years ago, looking down on this quad from the hidden corner of the library.

Back at the office I wasn’t in the mood for anything. I was supposed to complete some Phys 95 grading and write notes on the recent journal club I presented, but I could not focus. I decided to return home early, for the second time that week, and I must have spent the first hour watching whatever show EJ was watching. But sometime later, I returned to my room and I started working and somehow when I came up for air, I had derived the partition function. No. That is too simple of a story. Let’s try again: I returned home and started reading through my notes on the calculation of a_{N, k}. I realized that if I was going to be able to derive a partition function I would need to express these coefficients as an integral. After working through the example where N=k, I managed to find a correct integral expression. This would have been a solid success for the day, and I considered stopping, but I had already come this far; why shouldn’t I go farther? I wrote the combinatorial expression for the partition function, and then after more pages of calculations I obtained the partition function at about 3 in the morning. The final expression was enthralling. It didn’t quell all the disappointment of the day but it certainly came close. 

I suppose there was some degree of faith which led to this outcome. Why else would I have spent so much time trying to find that final integral had I not believed it existed in that nebulous expanse of undiscovered mathematical truths? It was not precisely a faith in myself, but rather a faith that the world had order and that this order could be expressed in a way I and others could understand. Just how far this faith in a world of order extends into human affairs I do not know. But what I hope is that this faith can continue to buoy me when I feel lost in the human world.

Moving Forward in Protein Design
After I concocted a biomolecular motivation for the “statistical physics of the symmetric group” system, I was confronted with a glaring limitation of the model. Although the model was soluble, it’s solubility was predicated on the assumption that each element was unique. So, when we took N>>1, we assumed we were rearranging a large number of distinguished elements with no repeated elements. The problem is that in the real protein design problem, although we are searching over a space of permutations, we are doing so with at most 20 unique amino acids. Thus a chain of 300 amino acids would have many repeated elements. I thought this hurdle was insurmountable so I never tried to…surmount (?) it. But a recent perusal of math stack exchange revealed a generalization to the derangement formula which would be key finding a thermal description closer to what I claimed motivated this analysis. 

If we have n_1 elements X_1, n_2 elements X_2, and so on up to n_r elements X_r in some ordered chain, then the number of ways to reorder the elements so that no element is in its original place is  given by

 


where  is the mth Laguerre polynomial. This formula was first derived by S. Even and J. Gillis in 1976 and termed the “generalized derangement formula.” In lieu of a derivation, whose technicality is currently beyond me, here are some example applications: If we have the word “WAHALA”, the number of ways to completely rearrange these letters such that none are in their original position would be 

.

If we have the word MISSISSIPPI, the number of ways to completely rearrange these letters such that none are in their original position would be 



If we have an initially ordered deck of 52 cards, what is the number of ways we can reshuffle the cards so that their ranks (but not necessarily their suits) DO NOT match the respectively ordered card in the original deck. (I.e, you can imagine it as having four different decks of cards from 1 to 13. We want to know the number of ways to rearrange the deck so that no card is in a place matching the number of the card previously in its place.) The answer is 



Now what I would like to do is incorporate this generalized formula for derangements into a calculation of the partition function, but to do so I would need to define some hamiltonian. The stupidest choice you could come up with is to take the energy to be proportional to the number of incorrectly placed elements. This would in turn require us to find a formula for “the number of ways to rearrange n_1 elements X_1, n_2 elements X_2, and so on up to n_r elements X_r in some ordered chain, such that j elements are in their incorrect position.” Such a formula would be able to answer questions like 

What is the number of ways to rearrange the letters in WAHALA such that only three letters are NOT in their correct place? (j = 3)
What is the number of ways to rearrange the letters in MISSISSIPPI such that only two letters are NOT in their correct place? (j = 2)
What is the number of ways we can reshuffle an initially ordered deck of 52 cards, so that only 10 cards are in places where their ranks (but not necessarily their suits) DO NOT match the respectively ordered card in the original deck. (j=10)

Now, of course, in the most realistic manifestation of the protein design problem, what would really determine the energy of the rearranged chain is not merely the number of incorrectly placed elements, but 1) the type of element which is rearranged and 2) where it falls along the chain. Both of these factors are ignored in this initial hamiltonian, BUT(!) we have to start somewhere. 

I posted this question on stack exchange two weeks ago and have so far received no bites. Perhaps because the question is poorly worded? Fortunately, I have a few ideas of the properties a generalization should satisfy and I can always check a proposed formula against a computational example. One property the generalization should satisfy is 



Namely, if we sum the number of ways to have j incorrect elements, from 0 to n_1 + … + n_r, we should simply get the formula for the total number of ways to rearrange n_1+ … + n_r elements corrected by repeats. 

There are two obvious cases: If we have 0 incorrectly placed elements, then the answer should be . If all of the elements are incorrectly placed then we should just get the formula derived by Even and Gillis. It is the in between case which would require some work. 

After I find this formula and find a way to incorporate it into a half-way decent characterization of the protein design problem, the next step would be to look at some special cases. 
— Polar and non-polar proteins (the case studied in Eugene’s paper): Assume you have only two types of proteins, and you want to consider various ways of rearranging them. 
— Six types of amino acids: polar, non-polar, hydrophobic, hydrophilic, basic, acidic. Assume you have six types of amino acids
— 20 amino acids: Assume you have the full 20 set of amino acids. What implications would we find in this case?

Lessons from Fall 2017
I have not started and completed a sufficiently new investigation to justify another “Lessons in X” document, but it has been about a year since I wrote such a document, and I have learned some new things or at least clarified some of the things I previously believed I had learned. Most of these lessons extend from my work on permutation glasses, the favorable contact model, and the other combinatorial systems related to the favorable contact model. 

Outline

1. Your first question need not be your final question

2. Writing a paper clarifies your question

3. Listen to the structure, not your ego

4. Start modestly and concretely (don’t be impatient)

5. Begin tangentially and move laterally

6. Generate as many questions as possible

7. Establish a clear and conceptually concrete system first; Don’t just play with math

—————————-

Your first question need not be your final question: This lesson is a clarification of my previous statement “You don’t know the question.” By that previous statement, I meant that whenever you begin an investigation, you always have a question you’re trying to answer, but this question is often developed in a large space of ignorance. Thus this initial question is likely not the question which best elucidates the new phenomenon or system you’re studying, and you do not yet know what that better question is. The practice of completing an investigation is as much about finding that question as it is about solving problems defined by lesser questions. 

The picture I always return to when thinking about the claim “You don’t know the question,” is Uri Alon’s depiction of choosing a scientific problem. In an article, he shows the investigator as beginning at point A and intending to go to B. But in the end, the path to B is blocked or is deemed inadequate, so the investigator ends up going to B’ and this path from A to B’ ends up being the definition of the investigation. 
The claim that the first question need not be the final question is somewhat different. The associated picture would be more like someone who starts from A intending to reach B, only to reach B and find that there is a better question at C or C’. Eventually this investigator reaches some Z and has to admit that B was not the best question to ask and it was only the limits of his insight which forced him to ask it first. 
When thinking about this process, the image that comes to mind is from the recent film Doctor Strange in which at one point the title character and his mentor run around many worlds and universes changing the landscape around them as they make their way to a new destination. The same thing happens when you’re working on a problem. In scientific investigations the landscape of what you see and what conceptual and technical areas you think you’re passing through are defined by your understanding of the destination, an understanding which continually evolves as you make your way towards it, and which thus continually evolves the surrounding landscape along with it.

Examples of this in recent memory are numerous. The dissociable favorable contact model came from a question quite different from that which motivated the original favorable contact model. The permutation glass extended from trying to find an analytic solution to the IMDB model. (OK, I guess I only have two examples)

Flannery O’Connor suggests this really is the best way to do creative work: “No surprise for the writer means no surprise for the reader.” (Rough paraphrase)

Stephen King agrees: I distrust plot for two reasons. For one life is largely plotless, And two plot and the spontaneity of true creation are not compatible. 

Takeaway: Begin with a concrete question, but do not feel the need to stay committed to it. Always be on the lookout for better ways to frame your ignorance of the system you’re studying. 
——————————————————
Writing a paper clarifies your question: I recently made a significant step in my framing of the favorable contact model. It came from trying to write a paper on results I obtained almost a year ago. I was able to write much of the analytical work fairly easily, but what remained a sticking point was the relationship between my results and an experimental system. Now, I did not have to include an “experimental realization” section in the paper, but I thought I should since the analytical system was partly motivated by a well-articulated experimental system, and if I didn’t mention this system myself, it would have been mentioned by the reviewers along with some sensible questions about what I was hiding. 

The problem was a physical prediction. My initial estimate of the temperature at which favorable binding was likely was much too low (~90 K), so I tried to treat the calculation more carefully. A more careful calculation lead to a temperature which was much too high (~400 K). I eventually realized that part of the problem was that my model had one feature which was quite unnatural to a realistic system: In this first model, the subunits of different pairs could switch pairs without existing as individual subunits in an intermediate state. This line of questioning eventually led me to include dissociation and volume into my analysis, all of which led to a new framing of the favorable contact model. None of this would have transpired if I didn’t try to write a paper of my then current results. 

Takeaway: When you think you’ve completed your work, write a paper on it to send to someone. Likely, the process of writing the paper will reveal to you holes in the existing work which lead to newer and better questions. 
——————————————————
Listen to the structure, not your ego: All investigations are born from and are extended by questions. One must therefore be careful as to choose the questions which best elucidate the structure and properties of the central idea. In the past, many of my questions were motivated by some self-centered desire to do “important work” and thus I was led astray to prematurely pursue questions which were insufficiently defined to yield any concrete results. 

It took a great deal of self-examination and repeated crises before I was able to reduce enough of this self-absorption for the world to return into view. But when the reduction was initiated and continued, it then become much easier to take investigations one step at a time and allow them to unfold according to what appeared in the mathematics rather than what was dictated by my initial militant ignorance. 

Here’s a metaphor which depicts the problem. Imagine a man in a jungle who has dedicated himself to searching for some lost city of gold. He goes along with his machete and axe cutting down the foliage in his path, scaring away all other sentient life and making a mess of his trail, only to find nothing in the end. And yet, if he was less driven by what he believed was there and by what he believed he must find, he might have noticed a path in the bush, slightly worn by the feat of many animals, which, in time, would have led to some secret cavern no one else had ever seen before.

It might seem strange for me to state this lesson so patly. Clearly, what motivated me to begin the thermal permutations work was an egocentric desire to show that I could derive analytically what I was asked to show computationally. But this, I think, is somewhat different from the egocentrism which can taint the process of question-definition. The egocentrism I displayed when pursuing that first analytic solution was of a kind born from recognizing a potential structure and believing I could make it real. The egocentrism which enters into question definition extends from having no structure but trying to spontaneously create one because you feel it’s existence would in some way complete you. 

I have to warn myself against the more maladaptive form of egotism because now that I have some good results, I may become so attached to the feeling these results induce that I become blind to the structural insights which ultimately led to them. I need to remember to not choose questions based on what I think will make me well-known, but to always begin modestly and see what the structure of what I’m studying suggests I should look at next. 

Takeaway: Pay careful attention to the structure you continually expose. Do not hold fast to questions which extend from some self-centered desire for greatness. 
——————————————————
Start modestly, concretely, and carefully (and don’t be impatient): When I began all of this thermal permutation work, my very first aspirational objective was to find an analytic formula for a computational result. With respect to the work that followed, this formula has proven to be trivial, but it took me many concerted hours of thought to obtain it. It was a modest result but it was concrete enough to lay the foundation for everything that followed. 

This is true as well for the favorable contact work. I think I first derived the partition function for the favorable contact model around December of last year. The derivation was more involved than previous ones, but it helped establish a baseline for all other generalizations one of which I found recently. 

If there is one thing which plagued many of my previous efforts at question formulation is that whenever I began an investigation, I defined my initial questions too broadly. There was some larger question I was trying to answer and instead of building up carefully the sub-theorems and conceptual framework for this larger question, I was so impatient that I would run to attack it directly and would immediately find myself lost and confused. 

But there are untold benefits to beginning modestly and somewhat far afield from where your ambitions desire you to go. For one, given your relative ignorance of the features of the new terrain, it will always be easier at the beginning to obtain modest results than it would be to obtain the more ambitious ones.  In fact the more ambitious results often require a concepts and techniques which are only built up by working through less complicated problems. 

Second, these modest problems are also often very concrete and thus there are manifold ways to check if the things you’re computing make sense. Learning how to do such checks then proves to be incredibly useful when the systems became so complicated that it is difficult to derive analytic solutions without checks.

Finally, obtaining a concrete result at the start of an investigation (no matter how modest) gives one a small amount of confidence that generality is possible. Results in mathematics always exist in a large, but often obscured, space where many other similar results reside. Attempting to enter that space through the small door created by a modest investigation can quickly open it entirely up when it would have been impenetrable if it had been approached through a more challenging problem.

Starting in this way requires a nontrivial amount of patience seeing as you have to begin somewhat away from where your interests truly lie, and you must then go through the slow and careful work of posing and answering more general questions.

Takeaway: When you start an investigation, you should define your initial questions as concretely and modestly as possible. Answering these questions will then make it possible to answer the larger questions which inspired the investigation. 
——————————————————
Begin tangentially and move laterally: If you’re trying to answer a question it is preferable to start in a place distinct from and easier to navigate than the point defined by your desired question. This is arguably a sub/repeated point for the last one, but I set it apart in order to highlight its importance. 

The reason beginning tangentially is often preferred is that theoretical results always exist in a network of other theoretical results and by beginning with a question different from the desired question you can build results and concepts which make it easier to articulate the desired question. 

Here is a conceptual metaphor: Imagine you’re trying to retrieve a ball stuck under an overhanging branch in a fast moving river. If you were to enter the river at the location of the ball, you would be quickly swept away. But if you were to walk up stream and enter the river from a location away from the ball, the current would eventually carry you to where the ball is. (Of course this metaphor is not perfect because obtaining new results is not a passive process of letting logic sweep you to natural conclusions. But the sense that an direct attack is ultimately ineffective is consistent. )

Takeaway: Beginning somewhat apart from your intended destination helps you build the conceptual and technical framework to more easily get to the intended destination. 
——————————————————
Generate as many questions as possible: Let’s say you followed all of the above pieces of advice. You defined a modest and concrete question and you managed to answer it. What next? Of course, the answer is that you ask more questions. Indeed the motive force in any investigation comes from the diversity and quality of questions you are able to ask. 

However, because it is often difficult to determine the most fruitful directions for a research project it is important that you generate as many questions as possible. You will not be able to answer all of these questions, and of the ones you answer, not all will be worth pursuing, but this process is required to get to that small subset of questions which are answerable and interesting. 

For example, after I analytically solved the computational IMDB problem, I wrote down the following list of questions: 

Is there a large N limit to this solution?
What is the order parameter of this system?
Does the model exhibit a phase transition?
If we make the couplings probabilistic, can we analyze the system as a spin glass?
Is the model dual to any common statistical mechanics problem?

I can’t remember which of these questions I answered first, but reflecting on it, it seems I was indeed able to answer all of them, even the question about whether the model was dual to a statistical mechanics problem. (The answer is maybe. It has similarities with a one-dimensional fermion system.)

Now it is of course somewhat obvious that questions form the scaffolding for any investigation, but considering the number of unsolved and latent projects which exist in my personal problems folder, it seems I have not completely internalized this lesson. 

So besides making this an explicit point, for guidance, I think it’ll be helpful to list the kinds of questions one could ask.

General types of questions
What if…
Is there a way to…
How would you…
How could I determine…
Can this be generalized to…
Can this be extended to the case where…

More specific questions
Is there a computational representation of the question?
Can I associate an analytic formula with this?

It should be possible to get multiple questions from each type listed above and among these questions, there should be one which falls in the intersection between interesting and soluble. 

Takeaway: At the start of an investigation, generate as many questions as possible. Not all of these questions will lead to directions you think are worth pursuing, but in my experience there are always a few of them that do. Thus such generation is the only way to push the investigation forward and ultimately find the interesting and soluble questions which give more order to it.
——————————————————
Establish a clear and concrete conceptual system first; don’t just play with mathematics: If I remember my time in CERN clearly, I spent a few night in the library trying to find some concrete representation for my ideas on Wilson lines and decay processes and on Stokes theorem and quantum field theory. The work was stymied by a lack of rigor and a lack of insight into what I was trying to understand. I was rearranging many symbols on the paper but what did these symbols represent physically or at least conceptually. 

This is one thing which differentiates my current self-started work from much of my past self-started work. Both works were abstract, but it is only recently that I’ve been able to couple a qualitative yet concrete picture to the abstraction. When I started the permutation work, I didn’t have a clear physical system to compare it to, but I did have an image in my head of what was happening when I moved symbols around on a piece of paper: There were lattice sites and elements, and the elements moved around the lattice sites in ways which led to the distributions I calculated. The picture has changed over the course of the investigation, but there had always been a picture which modulated the abstraction. The picture gave direction to my questions and generalization, even if that direction was myopic, and thus I was able to establish concrete footholds which moved the project forward. 

I think previously wrote that one should follow the mathematics when completing decidedly mathematical investigations. I still agree with this, but mathematics alone cannot provide direction: it can only structure the directions you choose to pursue. These directions, I think, have to begin and extend from a conceptual picture for which the mathematics is a more rigorous proxy. 

Takeaway: Always use a conceptual picture or the system or question to frame your mathematical analysis, so that you’re not just moving symbols around on a piece of paper. 

(Find some way to express Stokes theorem exactly as a relationship between gaussian and Grassmannian integrals, and then integrate over the variables to express the system exclusively in terms of the integrals)

Quotes from Radical Innovators

Months ago I read sections from Radical Innovators (by Anton Blok). Here are a list of quotes I found noteworthy. 

Radical innovation tends to come from outsiders, from people who, after suffering adversity and exclusion, stand with their back to the wall. They have little to lose and can therefore take more risks and notice and take advantage of windows of opportunity. As Sulloway concisely phrases it, “From a Darwinian point of view, the evolutionary costs of risk taking are low whenever the prospects of survival or reproduction are also low. Risk taking is a useful strategy in the quest to find an unoccupied niche, and it is an important component of openness to experience.” If you have little to lose, you can take more risks, but there is no certainty. Taleb reminds us, “Clearly risk taking is necessary for success—but it is also necessary for failure.” Retrospectively, the success goes for all radical innovators; failure afflicts the majority—victim’s of nature’s broom.  - pg??

His eye-deficiency seems the most perfidious trick that fate could inflict on a stargazer, but how is one to decide whether an inborn affliction will paralyse [sic] or galvanize?
Arthur Koestler on Kepler in The Sleepwalkers (1964: 239-240)

Most of the artists who survive the selection of history had a deficiency to overcome that inspired them to alter and expand the language of their art. 
Charles Rosen, “Prodigy without peer,” TLS (2004:3-4)

 Outsiders have little to lose and can therefore take more risks. Risk-taking is necessary for success, but also necessary for failure. This helps explain why radical innovation, also called “reconceptualization,” tends to come from outsiders rather than from the established, who, by taking risks, could lose everything they have always believed in and have to start over again. Resistance to change may also explain why some outsiders had their breakthroughs rejected for “insufficient evidence,” as happened in the two well-known cases of posthumous recognition and rehabilitation of Mendel (genetics) and Wegener (earth sciences). 

Being unmarried, leading a somewhat withdrawn existence, and having a passionate drive are among the main characteristics of the habits of pioneers which distinguish them from other people. Always more observer than participant, they were aware of the pressure that sooner or later emanates from any company. Many pioneers would probably have agreed with Montaigne’s view, “I find that it is somewhat more tolerable to be always alone than never able to be so.” Inherently pleasurable activities like play, leisure, and relaxation were often anathema to them. They generally did not like sociability and small talk. That is why they were often considered shy and socially awkward.  pg. —

The larger objective of Blok’s work is to contest the standard narrative of how innovation happens and who innovates. He disagrees that it is primarily due to that vague quality called “Genius” or that it cannot be explained. Instead he argues that most innovation comes from marginalized people who’s peripheral status, first, allows them to see things the community cannot see, and second, makes the risks for failure small in comparison to the risks for the insiders. The combination of these two factors—insight and risk-indifference—in one person along with sufficient (but strangely not overly-extensive) technical training makes said person more likely to develop new and useful work for the canon of their field.

Quotes from Gerald Holton’s “Candor and Integrity in Science” 2002

He [Bridgman] said “physics is the quantitative exploration and analysis of physical experience.” Those words meant what they said: quantitative, exploration, experience. He was guided not by fashionable new theories but by thermodynamics, and the prospect of huge areas of new physical phenomena to be conquered. 

[]

Like some other scientists I have studied, Bridgman saw no fundamental difference between science and philosophy if properly conceived, nor really between his life and his work, nor between public and private science. 

[]

New science starts in the head of an individual, but it does not survive unless it becomes part of the consensus of the community.

[]


Bohr’s favorite quotation was from Schiller: ‘Only fullness leads to clarity / And truth lies in the abyss.’ To gain the real treasures one must be ready to descend into the abyss, that dangerous place at the bottom where two huge slopes (representing contrary theories) push against each other.

[]

I have already begun to move into the second of the principles of integrity in science. It concerns the difference between choosing the narrowly specialized problems—relatively safe but at the cost of a fragmenting and disintegrating tendency for the subject—versus choosing the more difficult problem that has some promise to bring coherence to the field, and with it integrity in the second sense of that word. To put it succinctly, the second principle might run as follows: Try to be a scientist first, a specialist second. If you have it in you to make more than individual bricks that others might use, through your life’s energies into work on what Einstein called the great temple of science. 

[]

As Bronowski wrote, “Science is not a set of facts, but a way of giving order and therefore giving unity and intelligibility to the facts of nature.’ (Bronowski, 1956, “The Educated Man in 1984”)

[]

The laboratory remains our workplace, but it must not become our hiding place.

[]

…having been helped to become scientists and to live as scientists in this suffering world, we are the beneficiaries of unusual privilege, of scarce resources of the painful labors of our scientific parents. The mechanics we learned in school came to birth in the anguish of Galileo, dictating his book in his old age, disgraced, blind and under house arrest. Kepler died on a highway like a dog, on one of his futile journeys to find money to pay for printing the books from which we have learned his laws. Indeed, many of the formulas we rely on every day were distilled from the blood and sweat of our distant forbears, most of them now forgotten. We stand not only on the shoulders of a few, but also at the graves of thousands.

The Styles of Mathematical Modeling in Science

As a student of physics, I have been exposed to dozens upon dozens of models which purportedly describe our natural world. Although all of these models seemed to have been created with a common aim, I now realize they did not all extend from common modeling philosophies. Even with the same set of physical principles, there are manifold ways to combine and apply them in an attempt to say something specific about reality. I began to realize all this during this semester. After attending a few talks in the widely applied mathematics (WAM) seminar, I soon realized that the models people were working to build were quite different from the ones I was interested in dealing with. For reasons, I have only begun to question I have always been interested in analytic solubility and, as a result, the models I have studied, although “clean” in some sense, have been somewhat removed from the reality which motivated them (I am thinking of the statistical physics of the symmetric group and the favorable contact model). But the models I have seen presented in the seminar seemed to have no bias toward equations. They were principally concerned with describing biological systems in whatever way they could. 

The distinction I’m making is not the one I’ve made before concerning the difference between mathematical biology and biophysics. The WAM seminar models I’m talking about indeed applied physics to biological problems in a way which satisfies my definition of biophysics. But the default approach was to set up some dynamical equations for a conjectured system, run simulations, and then watch the evolution of those simulations to get a sense of how well the dynamical equations modeled the reality. Often the investigator would extract some quantitatively defined physical quantities from the simulations, and then plot those quantities against one another to yield scatter plots which in the best cases looked like the noisy real-life data of clean theory predictions. The end result of all this activity was some physical understanding of the system, but I never felt that I really understood what was going one. 

I guess what I’m wrestling with is a divide between two ways of mathematically rendering our natural world. This is a divide roughly defined by a fidelity to one of two things: a fidelity to reality with all of its messy insolubility or a fidelity to abstractions which are motivated by aesthetics first and physical relevance second. 

I’m thinking here of the difference between the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the neuron and the Hopfield neural network. Or the difference between the quantum mechanics of a molecule and the quantum mechanics of the harmonic oscillator. Or between the magnetic field of a finite bar magnetic and the magnetic field of a current loop. All models in physics are idealizations but some models are more idealized than others and for some reason I am more attracted to the most idealized versions in lieu of their more realistic counterparts.

To be candid, I have chosen to label these two approaches in this way because I believe many of the models with reasonable fidelity to reality are not attractive. Not attractive in the sense that they do not have the scent of mathematical inevitability which hints at any deeper generalizations. These realistic models seem too intentionally constructed, like a thing that man has cobbled together from mud, sticks, and stones, rather than a thing that God has revealed.

To make my appearance of elitism complete, I should mention there appears to be a similar distinction in high energy physics between phenomenologists and more abstract theorists. The distinction is revealed by the equations they play with in their work: while the MSSM is messy, complicated, and realistic—or at least relatively so—the actions of string theory are clean, aesthetic, and improbable.

(It is thus ironic that although in the past I claimed to not be able to learn string theory due to its abstraction, I am now immersed in the study of abstract representation of bimolecular systems.)

But this analogy between high energy physics and that nebulous domain called quantitative biology is not perfect. One difference is that, while quantitative biology is saturated with simulations, it is still possible to do high energy phenomenology without knowing how to code. Thus, in this analogy, my particle physics counterpart would not be questioning the utility of a different presentation of mathematical results, but rather the utility of the complicated but more realistic equations of phenomenology.

But I suppose the root of my contention is indeed with the choice of simulations over analytics. I had always taken it for granted that equations were the most transparent representation of mathematically defined relationships, but recently Seung-Ho told me that he had an advisor who once claimed to not understand an equation unless he saw it simulated. Thus, I have been living in a bubble of my own values. 

To step outside the bubble requires me to consider a number of questions: 

— If I have a bias to “clean”  (a term which I have conveniently left undefined) models, what do they provide me (and perhaps science at large) that the more messy models do not? 

— And given my predilection for deriving analytic results, what do they provide that simulations do not? 

— And for the sake of argument, what do simulations provide us (besides a shortcut to simulated solubility) that equations do not?

Answers/Comments

I might be led to claim that my philosophy is one of thinking deeply about simple things rather than thinking superficially about complicated things. However this is an ungenerous appraisal of the work I’ve seen in the WAM seminar. The systems people have presented are undoubtedly complicated, but I could not say that the associated analyses are superficial. Instead, the complications of the system require rather involved analyses leading the investigator to become immersed in computational analyses I wouldn’t consider undertaking. So a more accurate claim is that I think deeply about simple things rather than thinking deeply about complicated things, partly because the complication makes thinking deeply so parameter and model dependent that it is unclear that your deep thoughts have generality beyond the model you’re considering. This is one thing that an equation provides that a simulation does not: a faster route to intuition-motivated extensions and evaluations of the system. 


[//]

Another way to render the distinction is to phrase it as one between analyzing a specific system with as much reality as one can must and analyzing a greatly abstracted representation of that system.

How We Think and Learn (by Jean Ormrod) Notes 

Collection of notes from Ormrod’s interesting book on how people learn and think. 

Chapter 5 — In-Depth Cognitive Processing: Maximizing the “Long-Term” in Long-Term Memory

There are various strategies for learning new information in a meaningful way. They are all examples of the “in-depth cognitive processing” which is necessary to incorporate new experiences and information into long-term memory. 

Connect Old to New: One strategy is to connect new information with old information in some way so that instead of interpreting the new information as a separate sphere of information it becomes an extension to what you know well. 

Elaborate New Knowledge: Another refinement of this tactic is called elaboration. In elaboration, you take new knowledge and you supplement it or organize it in some way so that it becomes more meaningful to you than its initial presentation suggested. In this strategy, one should not be concerned with merely remembering information exactly as it is presented, but should try to create context for that information. Some questions you can ask about your new knowledge (From Ormod)
	- What implications does this stuff have?
	- In what situations might it be useful?
	- Might it help me do something better?
	- Or might it help me better understand certain phenomena in my physical or social environment? 
	- In what ways might it help me make meaningful contributions to my society or cultural group? 

Evaluate and Critique New Information: When receiving new information, it is important to not commit it to new knowledge without examination. You should instead try to determine the accuracy, credibility, and value of the information and reasoning. Do not take facts at face value, but try to find sources for them before repeating them. Realize as well that different people place different weights on different aspects of an argument and often  follow only one logical path of an argument without realizing there are many other choices. 

There are number of standard questions you should ask when you’re studying new material. 

— Who created this [document/website]? What motives of biases might the author have?
— What key assumptions underlie the claims being made here?
— What evidence or logic is the author using to support the claims? Can you think of evidence that might contradict one or more claims? 
— Is the information presented here consistent with what you’ve learned from other sources? If not, how is it different? Is it possible to synthesize the varying perspectives in some coherent and logical way? 


Action Item: When reading a paper, listening to a lecture, or working through a textbook section, try to find something not mentioned by the source material which is nevertheless connected to it. Better yet, try to find something that you know well that you can connect to the source material. 

Also, when reading new essays, ask the above standard questions to evaluate the information therein. Always try to find primary sources and apply the same questioning to these sources.

Jacob’s Quantum Mechanics

Weeks ago I had the privilege of learning about Jacob’s perspective on quantum mechanics. Using (in my opinion) quite a bit of mathematical formalism, he showed that all of the principles of quantum mechanics could be reduced to the statement 

Measurements do not necessarily commute. 

Which is to say if I were to measure a quantity A then measure a quantity B and then measure the quantity A again, I would not necessarily obtain the same results for both measurements of A. Measurement B could changed the system in some way. Much of the formalism Jacob developed in the lecture concerned making rigorous this idea of “measurement”, and I am still not absolutely sure how one could abstract this more rigorous definition to something in the real world. Jacob did emphasize that this principle is not a restatement of the general claim that all measurements obey the uncertainty principle because all measurements disturb a system because they must be observed optically through perturbing photons. Instead, Jacob asserted that even idealized measurements without these “photon induced perturbations” do not commute under quantum mechanics. 

From all this Jacob was led to the rather interesting conclusion that information is physical seeing as extracting information from a system changes it in such a way that it has different properties (as defined by measurements) before and after the extraction of information. 

Jacob started on this investigation because he had a number of questions that he believed traditional formalisms in quantum mechanics either could not answer or usually ignored (e.g., Where does the state come from? Why do we use Hilbert Space?) But there were a number of things I critiqued about Jacob’s new approach to quantum mechanics. For one, it was perhaps less logically arbitrary than the accepted approaches, but it was only so at the cost of additional formalism and abstraction, abstractions which would seem just as arbitrarily motivated to new students and even to physicists. 

Jacob’s pitch for his new approach to quantum mechanics began with the argument that the three standard ways to introduce students to quantum mechanics (an historical approach, a wave equation approach, and a state ket approach) were deficient because they all led to students having wrong beliefs about the nature of quantum mechanics (e.g., that it is about wave functions in three-dimensions) or to them simply not understanding what is fundamental about quantum mechanics. He also stated that these standard approaches had a number of questions that they either could not answer or usually just ignored (e.g., Where does the state come from? Why do we use Hilbert Space?) 

But there were a number of things I critiqued about Jacob’s own approach. For one, students’ beliefs about quantum mechanics were only debilitating in so far as these students were unwilling to later correct simpler representations of a subject with its more accurate and complex representations—the way students do, for example, when they transition from studying angular momentum in one-dimension to studying rigid body motion in general. Second, although his was perhaps less logically arbitrary than the accepted approaches, it was only so at the cost of additional formalism and abstraction, abstractions which would seem just as arbitrarily motivated to new students. Finally, what is “fundamental” about quantum mechanics is not useful to all students.

With respect to this last point, I asked whether his would really be the best way to present quantum mechanics all new students, especially considering that students in a first quantum mechanics course enter it for various reasons not all of which coincide with trying to understand the deepest and most fundamental principles of reality. I am thinking of the engineers and chemists who take quantum mechanics as preparation for solid state or physical chemistry courses, respectively. How much would they benefit from a logically rigorous, but more mathematically abstract, presentation of quantum mechanics? Jacob conceded this point stating that this was an approach geared toward physicists, a statement which naturally led to the more specific query of whether even physicists would find this useful.

On my part, I could not escape the question of how necessary the abstract mathematical formalism was. For example, there are more formal versions of quantum field theory and mechanics that exist in the canon of mathematical literature, but which are ignored by most physicists because they do not make contact with the current dominant value systems in physics. That is, although mathematicians value the utmost logical rigor in much of their work, physicists are willing to relax the demands of rigor if it allows them to focus on what they think defines “an understanding of the phenomenon”.

Physicists are willing to accept a certain lack of mathematical rigor because their work is not principally concerned with elucidating the structure and properties of the mathematics that more precisely encode their qualitative ideas. Instead physicists “simply” strive to understand physical reality, but of course this characterization of the work of physicists requires us to pin down what exactly it means to “understand physical reality.” I used to think that for physicists there was one meaning that every physicist (or more precisely every theorist) strived to achieve, it but Jacob’s presentation has made it clear this is not exactly so. 

The meaning concerns the relationship between principles and predictions. Jacob asserted that what is deep and interesting about quantum mechanics is not the ability to predict the discrete binding energies of hydrogen, but the principles underlying those predictions. This belief is what seemed to have led him to construct a course where the instructor works on presenting the best logical framing for those principles rather than focusing on the predictions which exist merely as their experimental proxies. This of course is just a value judgment about what is important in physics, and on the face of it is seems like a rather pedestrian one, but I now believe it is quite radical, running counter to not only how the majority of physicists apply their trade but also to how we teach it to new practitioners.

I had believed that the principal goal for all physicists was to understand the fundamental laws that govern our physical universe. However, the only way we can probe the veracity of these laws is through their predictions, so physicists must value the consequences of these laws at least in so far as these consequences are needed to evaluate the more foundational principles. 

In discerning the value system of any person, community, or organization we should of course politely take note of what they say, but should primarily pay attention to what they do. Jacob’s claim was that teachers of quantum mechanics have placed an inordinate value on consequences over understanding. Indeed, much of a modern quantum mechanics course consists of deriving predictions (or developing the techniques for deriving predictions) for physical systems while at the same time ignoring the various interpretations of quantum mechanics which arguably represent the essence of what it means to “understand” the subject. And most insidiously the system is self propagating because unbeknownst to students, as they work through all these quantum mechanics courses they are slowly being inculcated in this specifically utilitarian value system. Thus, today two tenured Harvard professors (one in high energy theory and the other in condensed matter experiment) can say without shame, that in their work they never think about the various interpretations of quantum mechanics. 

Perhaps the problem is that quantum mechanics seems to exist apart from the body of foundational subjects in physics since it is the only one which seems to necessitate various interpretive schemes. Why are there no interpretations for classical mechanics, statistical mechanics, or electrodynamics? Are the associated principles so transparent that one can apply them without feeling as though one is playing with rules one does not really understand? Or is it because the relative familiarity we have with the phenomena that these subjects describe have made it difficult to tease out the interpretative nuances which have biased our application of the subjects themselves? 

One value of Jacob’s rigorous approach, then, is that it restores principles to their rightful position as the physicist’s main focus. And my critique of Jacob’s approach has made me realize that I did not seem to care about the mismatch between the physicists’ claimed raison d’être and their pursuit of that purpose in practice. I had always claimed to believe that all physical investigations must begin and end with the phenomena, but in applying this dictum I have usually forgotten to take a wider lens and inspect what the physical investigations were saying about the nature of reality itself. In a sense, the results of my work—from the Pseudo-goldstino work to the Favorable Contact work today—implicitly acted upon the question: “Why reify the meaning of suggested physical principles if in the end we will be deriving the same predictions even without a deeper interpretation of those principles?”

Now, it is clear that there have been many times in the history of physics (not to mention the history of science as a whole) where one or a few intrepid individuals managed to change the value system and standards by which a community claimed to understand some physical or metaphysical world. There is of course the scientific method and the scientific revolution of the 17th century, but there is also “capital R rigor” and the mathematical revolution of the 19th century, and the increase in standards in sociology research for the current 21st century.  Therefore, I am forced to take seriously Jacob’s claim that this is really a better way to “do” quantum mechanics. But if Jacob is indeed correct, given his preferred approach, what exists in his value system that is missing from my own?

My first guess is that Jacob is more concerned than I am about trying to understand what a physical theory states about the reality it describes. This value is principally represented in Jacob’s statement “Information is physical.” Given the fact that measurements do not commute we are led to some deeper understanding about which exists as a physical quantity in our universe. 

Conversely, in lieu of understanding reality, I seem to be concerned with principles and their predictions because the models I study are so abstracted from the motivating physical system that I know it would be irresponsible to claim that I really know what is going on in system. The most I can hope for is qualitative statements motivated by what can be extrapolated from rigorous results derived from a quite different system. This is true for my work on the symmetric group, but my more recent work on favorable dimerization seems to be uniquely amenable to interpretation. Thus, it is worth striving to emulate Jacob’s values in my current work. The main question I would need to answer: 

What does the favorable dimerization model say/imply about the constraints governing the systems with “correct” and “incorrect interactions?

How We Think and Learn (by Jean Ormrod) Notes

Chapter 4—Key Components of the Human Memory System

The ways that humans can meaningfully learn new information are constrained by the human memory system. 

Cognitive Load: The human memory system can be roughly divided into three parts. There are the sensory registers which take in information; the working memory which uses attention to process that information in real-time; and finally long-term memory which keeps the information in our mind for time periods lasting from a day to decades. 

When learning something new, our working memory is being tasked and we must apply attention to learn effectively. However if we impose to great a demand on that working memory (by, for example, trying to remember more than 7 random letters) we begin learning less effectively. The cognitive load is how much you’re tasking the working memory, and in order to improve learning it’s useful to find strategies which reduce the cognitive load. This either involves increasing cognitive load through technology or finding ways to restructure information so that the cognitive load is reduced. 

Ways to reduce cognitive load
- Using a text document to keep track of what you learn is one simple strategy. 
- Organizing or encoding new information into meaningful structures is another. This requires you to continually try to structure your knowledge and find meaningful patterns by which to organize it. For example, if you were tasked with remembering the string of digits 56-78-987-654-3210 you might note that that the numbers are grouped as “2-2-3-3-4” and that it counts up to 9 from 5 and then back down to 0.  Or if you were tasked with remembering the 12 items

oak
mountain
daffodils
valley 
tulip 
daisy
cliff
maple 
hill
rose 
pine
elm

you might note that they can be organized into three categories of four items each. 

Action Item: When reading Discrete Thoughts, or Higher Speculations organize the main points in the various sections with diagrams and paraphrases.

How We Think and Learn (by Jean Ormrod) Notes

Chapter 7—Metacognition

Outside of the specific strategies you use to learn new material, your beliefs about learning and the way you self-regulate your learning affect how well you build understanding. Metacognition refers to all the ways one thinks about thinking. 

Epistemic beliefs: A person’s set of beliefs about he or she acquires and verifies knowledge. Your epistemic beliefs exist in the background of all your learning efforts, but ultimately constrain how you learn and what you learn from a study session. Do you believe understanding should come easy? Do you believe understanding is represented by interconnected facts? Are some people incapable of learning mathematics? All of these determine the way you build knowledge. 

One’s belief about knowledge in a certain domain can sometimes be said to transform from an unsophisticated position to a sophisticated position. The realist view sees knowledge as codified by what people say and do. This is a literal knowledge which allows one to take Santa Claus as real. The next stage is the absolutist view where one seed knowledge as not defined by people’s claims, but one does believe absolute truth does exist for every possible question. Subsequently, people can develop the multiplist position in which one accepts much knowledge as uncertain and entertains the possibility that there is not correct answer to some questions. Finally, people move into the evaluativist stage where one supplements the multiplist position with a value system which can pick out some claims as more true than others. 

These categories do not always manifest simply in one’s learning development. At any single point in time and within the same discipline of knowledge, you could be at multiple stages at once contingent on how far you’ve progressed in a specific direction. For example, one could be a relativist with regard to interpretations of quantum mechanics but be an evaluativist with regard to the best perturbation theory algorithms to apply to a specific problem. 

Self-Regulated Learning: As one learns a subject, the various strategies he or she employs to monitor and improve his or her learning are termed self-regulation strategies. One’s approach to self-regulated learning extends from one’s epistemic beliefs. For example, those who believe that knowledge is easily acquired through reading would not adopt the self-regulation strategy of writing down what they learn or evaluating what they know. 

Two difficult aspects of self-regulation are self-monitoring and self-evaluation. (*Your approach of writing lecture notes on your Jclub is a good self-regulation strategy that makes extensive use of self-questioning). One way to evaluate your understanding of a topic is to write an article (without references) explaining the topic to a hypothetical audience. You can then compare your article to those in the formal literature to see how well you capture essential ideas. 

Self-monitoring can be achieved through self-questioning. Here are some question stems to get you into the self-questioning mindset while you read: 
Explain why…
How might I use … to …?
What might happen if …?
How are … and … similar? How are they different?
What are some of the strengths and weaknesses of…?
How might I relate this idea to something I’ve studied before?

Action Item: Use self-questioning to consolidate your understanding when you read Discrete Thoughts and Higher Speculations. 


Chapter 8 — Conceptual Change

Although there is information all around us, the ambiguities involved in evaluating that information often allow us to take it in without modifying our own beliefs which contradict it. But learning what is true (or at least which is as true as can possibly be achieved) about the world requires that we interrogate our own beliefs and often change the way we see the world. In any case, it is always a slow process. 

Cognitive dissonance: Key to starting people on the path toward substantial conceptual change involves presenting evidence that, one, is hard to ignore and, two,  creates a sense of mental discomfort. 

This mental discomfort could be pedestrian in the sense that you learn that something about the physical world is not what you thought it was, or it could be existential in the sense that you learn something about yourself which changes not only the way you see yourself but the way you must subsequently live your life. (Learning that seasonal cycles are due to the tilt of the earth falls into the first category. Coming to terms with your sexuality falls into the second)

Cognitive dissonance exists on the opposite end of the spectrum from confirmation bias. The latter involves people weighing information they already agree with as higher than information that contradicts their beliefs and ultimately keeps people fixed in old and obsolete ways of seeing the world. 

Here is something that you wrote long ago:

I want to know what it means and does not mean to be a human being. I want to interrogate all the premises and unacknowledged prejudices upon which my sense of identity and my sense of respect for the human condition are based.

In order to achieve this you need to seek out evidence and arguments which contradict your current belief. 

Here are some tacit (but now articulated) beliefs that you should question: 
- You can give those in power the benefit of the doubt that they are exercising that power wisely.
- People who offend you know what they’re doing and thus offend you intentionally. 
- By doing good work, the way anonymous strangers treat you will change. 

Action Item: Find opportunities throughout your day to notice your assumptions about events and arguments and ask yourself why you have them an in what contexts they could be false. 


Chapter 9 — Bringing Other Factors into the Picture: How Emotions, Dispositions, and Attributions Affect Thinking and Learning. 

Beyond the cognitive and metacognitive aspects of learning discussed previously there are a number of other factors associated with emotional state, learning philosophy, and personality that affect learning. 

Disposition: We all have generally stable approaches to learning and thinking which defines what one can term a “disposition”. These dispositions like epistemic beliefs affect what we learn and how well we learn. However, unlike epistemic beliefs which involve often unarticulated assumptions about how we view truth and knowledge in the world, dispositions are thinking styles which are fostered and made stable through habit. Therefore, poor dispositions can be modified by identifying the associated habits and then working to change them into more constructive ones. 

Some constructive dispositions include: 
— Conscientiousness: a tendency to see information and events as complex and requiring careful analysis to understand. Also, dovetails with dependability and completing these analyses in a timely fashion. 
— Synthesis seeking: a tendency to try to seek out new information and organize it into a coherent whole rather than reading from a single information source or taking multiple sources as mutually exclusive alternatives
— Critical thinking: a propensity to engage in the elaboration and questioning strategies highlighted in previous sections. 
— Open-minded ness: the ability to flexibly consider alternative (and seemingly contradictory) viewpoints until one acquires enough information to reach a well-informed conclusion. Contrasted with a need for closure in which one seeks quick and simple answers about what is “true” in a question. 
— Effortful control: the ability to regulate one’s own thoughts and behaviors on the path toward achieving a goal. 

Action Item: Determine what your mental dispositions are for thinking and learning. Do you critically evaluate every new piece of information you receive? Or is your evaluation context dependent? Do you try to synthesize information from many sources, or do you jump to conclusions? 


These approaches become stable through habit, but can thus be modified by working to change poor habits into more constructive ones. 

Chapter 10 — Self Regulating Our Own Behavior: Turning Intentions into Actions 

In order to accomplish something not only must we be motivated to do so but we must also have concrete strategies for keeping ourselves moving in the right directions. These strategies comprise the ways we self-regulate our behavior. There are various components of self-regulation

Goal Setting: Setting goals is key in order to determine whether or not we’ve accomplished something and also to give us something to work towards as we’re learning or progressing. 

Abstract and long-term goals are easier to achieve if we break them up into concrete shorter term goals. For example, the goal of completing one’s dissertation in four years could be broken up year by year according to classes one wants to take and research projects to complete. 

In the same way concrete short-term goals relate to abstract long-term ones, it’s important to have proximal goals for our short term goals. Proximal goals are ones that we can complete in the next day or week and which move us closer to the long term goals. 

The goals you set should also be SMART(Y). That is they should be 
- specific (e.g., get a good grade (bad), get at  least a 95% on all homework, tests, and projects (good))
- measurable in terms of whether or not we are achieving them, 
- actionable in that it is possible to take action towards them, 
- reasonable in that they are possible to accomplish given our skill-set and time frame, 
- time-sensitive in that there is a specific deadline by which we want to accomplish them, 
- we should know for ourselves “the why” of this goal, namely the reason we’re pursuing it. 

There are two types of goals we can pursue: mastery goals and performance goals. Mastery goals involve developing proficiency in a certain domain (e.g., learning the calculus of manifolds) and performance goals culminate in us presenting ourselves or our work to others (e.g., writing a paper). Sometimes the goals exist together as when someone who is writing a paper gradually develops greater mastery of the larger field of work. 

Planning: After setting goals, it’s necessary to devise specific plans to achieve them. These plans should exist for the entire time frame which we’ve allotted ourselves to achieve the goal, and should detail how we would complete the associated tasks (is it a programming task? an analytic computation task?) and when we hope to complete them. 

Contingency Plans: One problem with specific planning is that one does cannot always make necessary contingency plans simply because one does not know what contingency plans to make. For example, I didn’t make a “new-insight” contingency plan for writing up the favorable contact model and thus was unprepared when said new-insight required me to completely revise the project. This is what Ormrod calls a “hit-by a truck” scenario, and just because it is difficult to foresee does not mean that you should not create a plan in the first place. 

Biasing Your Environment: As you enact your plan, it is useful to do so in an environment which makes it easy to stay on task. Ormrod calls this “self-imposed stimulus control” or “situational strategies for self-control”. It involves placing needed resources close by and potential distracting elements (like phones and other people) far away. 

Self-Monitoring: You’ve set a goal and devised a plan. Now in order to monitor your progress toward the goal you need to find ways to track (a) how frequently you engage in the behaviors which bring you toward the goal and (b) whether the behaviors demonstrate progress toward the larger goals. You can see this self-monitoring as the “standards and review” part of your goal setting. 

An aspect of scale is necessary to mention here. This self-monitoring is perhaps most useful for larger and more long-term goals. For shorter term goals, it’s probably easiest to set the goal and work more on enacting the associated plan rather than wasting time evaluating how well the plan is being enacted. (Of course, if there are problems which reveal themselves in your plan, you should take some time to reevaluate that plan and/or the goal itself.)

Two examples of self-monitoring are a progress journal (like you had when you were learning quantum field theory) and an excel spreadsheet counting words written on various days. 

Self-Rewards: Self-imposing rewards for small successes is often a helpful way to encourage us to achieve a goal and reinforce the steady achievement of goals. For example, giving yourself an hour of television or buying an audio book after a project is accomplished is one way to make the accomplishment more tangible by connecting it to external stimuli. 
Examples of rewards
— Trips out of the city
— Trips to museums
— Cool electronics (Materialism FTW!)
— Books 
— Podcasts 

Action Items: Your previous goal list was insufficiently precise. You should work to modify it and supplement it with time-tables, action strategies (namely what specifically you will do to begin trying to achieve the goal), methods of self-monitoring, and possible rewards. Explaining in what ways the goals are SMART(Y) will also help make your work toward them more concrete.

Notes on “What Ever Happened to Planet Vulcan” by Thomas Leveson


Urbain-Jean-Joseph Le Verrier was a French mathematician who famously (and correctly) predicted the existence of the planet Neptune outside Uranus and also famously (and erroneously) predicted the existence of the planet Vulcan just inside Mercury’s orbit. The article is a short auto-biography and it details Verrier’s life events surrounding the discovery.  It’s an excerpt of the longer book “The Hunt for Vulcan.”

Le Verrier did not begin his career in an academic position. After graduating from the École polytechnique, he began working as a tobacco engineer in France’s École des Tabacas. He was competent, but it was apparent he wished to do something else. When a position as an assistant to a professor of chemistry in the École polytechnique was posted, he applied (even though his interests were more mathematical) but didn’t get it. 

He had spent seven years as a tobacco engineer before he applied for an assistantship in astronomy, and was accepted. When he re entered the École polytechnique, a first task he assigned himself was to study Newtonian gravitation and pin down all of the prediction-experiment relationships for the first four planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) in our solar system. He did this rather swiftly—learning the requisite theory, applying perturbation theory to predict the orbits, comparing the predictions to data tables—in under two years, and he found that Mercury’s behavior was not entirely consistent with predictions. He discovered this when he made a prediction for the appearance of Mercury as it traveled across the sun, and the prediction was found to be several seconds off. 

However, he could not fully pursue this anomaly because his supervisor suggested he work on the problem of Uranus, which also had an anomalous orbit. Verrier applied himself to the problem working for two years on the perturbation analysis and numerical calculations. He eventually concluded (predicted?) that Uranus’s deviations could be accounted for by the existence of another planet outside its orbit. Verrier predicted the mass of the planet and its distance from the sun. Verrier’s prediction was communicated to various observatories throughout France and the wider astronomical community. An observatory in Berlin then searched for the new planet and  found it. 

It should be mentioned that John Couch Adams had independently worked through the calculation and prediction of a new planet a few months (or at most a year) before Verrier, but did not publish the result, was not as careful in his error approximation and could not convince any of his contemporaries that the new planet was worth searching for. Leveson assigns credit to Le Verrier, and given the history on Wikipedia I lean toward agreeing. Who do people take to be the true discoverer of Neptune? In practice it seems to depend on how much the answerer sees himself as a francophile or anglophile. For example, having been educated in a former British colony, I always thought Adams was the discoverer and only learned of Le Verrier’s existence this year. 

Verrier was championed by the press and astronomical community. Years later (at the age of 48) he was finally able to return to the problem of Mercury. Applying gravitational theory and perturbation theory (and with the benefit of much better data than he had decades prior), he predicted that the precession of Mercury was due to the existence of a new planet (called Vulcan) just inside Mercury’s orbit. Over the following years many amateur and professional astronomers searched for the new planet and there were many false positives in both camps. News articles were published on a false confirmation, then the news article was corrected only for another false confirmation to be proved later. This seemed to go on for a few years before the astronomical community accepted Mercury’s orbit as a perplexing anomaly. But Le Verrier died believing he had discovered a new planet.

Cool quote from article about priority battle: 

"Still, the fact that the priority battle was so important to the British astronomical establishment tells its own tale. The discovery of Neptune—driven by the mathematical interpretation of fundamental laws, so exactly as to reveal itself within hours of the start of the search—was recognized at once as both a stunning display of individual genius and a triumph for a whole way of knowing the world. In point of fact, Le Verrier (and Adams) had made several arbitrary choices to simplify parts of the problem, most notably guessing how far away the perturbing planet had to be. Those estimates were off by a lot, which would seem to undercut any claim of prescience for their theoretical calculations. And yet even such a miscue actually conveys something of the power of Le Verrier’s reasoning, as he also figured out a way to frame the question to reduce the importance of distance for determining Neptune's position. It wasn’t luck (or not much) that delivered the new planet; it was the skill with which a very gifted Newtonian scientist had set up a calculation to tolerate a fair amount of wrongness in his assumptions. And in any event, for both the public and the world of professional astronomers, such slips simply disappeared in the glow of the bright, beautiful truth that Le Verrier had said go and look—there!—and you will see… and someone searched…and everyone saw."

Notes on "When is a Problem Solved" by Philip J. Davis 

Davis carefully discusses the various answers to a question one of his middle school students asked him: "How do we know when a problem is solved?"

The answer he wrote down (and arguably the philosophical answer this article argues for) was we do not really ever know when a problem is solved.

How can we be sure that he have solved a problem? More than this, how can we be sure we have formulated a proper question? We can’t because problems, questions and solutions are not static entities. On the contrary, the creation, formulation and solution of problems changes throughout history, throughout our own lifetime and throughout our readings and re-readings of texts. 

 However, this answer is not merely true in a philosophical sense. Different contemporary communities and the same community at different times have different standards of truth and as problems are reinterpreted by various temporally defined communities, previous solutions could be deemed as inadequate and a problem can go from being solved to unsolved.

Davis considers two large and somewhat distinct communities which have different standards of solution. In a school classroom, we can claim that a problem is solved when the solution satisfies the criteria that a teacher implicitly or explicitly outlined for it. The way Davis states this is particularly nice: 

Approached from the point of view of the individual or the group that makes up problems either for daily work, tests, or contests, I would suppose that the act of making up the problem already implies a more or less definite notion what the answer is. 

We could take this in a more nebulous direction, by recognizing that some simple to state problems cannot be solved and thus their "solution" in fact consists of an explanation for why the expected solution is not possible ("Express sqrt(2) as a ratio of two integers" is such a problem). 

In the community of formal mathematics, inspecting history leads us to conclude that a problem is never really solved. The author adds context to this fact by transcribing a discussion between an advisor (Stephen Maurer) and a graduate student (Andy Drucker) which was prompted by the graduate student asking "When is a mathematical theory complete?" The advisor answered that theories are complete when 1) the questions people sought to answer when constructing the theory are mostly answered; 2) the new results dry up and people find no new and important questions to ask; 3) never; mathematical theories are never truly "complete" in the denotative sense of the word, because there are always more questions to ask and higher standards for existing solutions. The advisor uses geometry of example in which n-dimensional theorems were proved through Euclidean methods long before dot-products and vectors were developed. His second example was of matroids which helped define a "linear algebra without the algebra" (i.e., without addition or scalar multiplication). Matroids were published in the 1930s for a purpose different from generalizing linear algebra and was only later applied to the ends of generalization in the 1960s.

Trying to Write
I’m currently trying to assemble/edit/create a few pieces of writing to send to the Dudley Review. I really want to submit pieces this year because this would be my fourth consecutive year of submissions and it would prove to me that I have some capability of writing something publishable each year. But I am currently at an impasse. I do not know what work I should submit or what work I should edit so that it is ready for submission. Last year I submitted two essays rather than pieces of fiction. Should I submit essays again this year? 

I am partly constrained by my existing body of work. I have always been drawn to fiction for its possibilities, but over the past year I have written no pieces of fiction. All of my scattered writings consist of short essays about things which may not be sufficiently generalizable to be of interest to anyone. The only pieces of fiction I can even think of submitting are things that I wrote almost five years ago ("Jamal and Cristina" and "Black City"), and these things are currently too long to submit to Dudley. 
 What did I do wrong this past semester? Why do I not have more choice in my submissions? 

Fiction requires a level of exclusive immersion which prevents me from thinking deeply about anything else. This too is true of my research work. Any activity which constantly demands that one constantly question the assumptions and the premises of the activity itself seems to prevent too many other activities from being accomplished concurrently. If I had tried this semester to write fiction and complete my research work, I fear I would have been trying to wear too many hats and would have thus been unable to wear any of them. I was taking Yoruba and teaching Physics 95, and I did not even complete my research goals. How could fiction writing have been pursued on top of these constraints?

This, I admit, sounds much like an excuse, especially since I have dreamt constantly of being both writer and physicist. This is not a particularly original dream and it is therefore not impossible. But I currently do not seem capable of apportioning my time so that both activities are possible. There are an endless series of physics projects both technical and philosophical that I want to complete and as I work toward them the voice pulling me to write stories about imagined people and scenarios grows fainter. I fear that as I grow older and my time is further subsumed into other activities the voice will disappear altogether. 

——

With regard to "Jamal and Cristina" (or as I have retitled it "Hate the Player") The introduction to the problem/story is so long that it seems like the story will be much more than 2000 words. In fact the introduction seems to set up the potential for character development which could extend into a novel. But I do not want to write a novel on this material. This story has plagued me for five years. Enough is enough. And yet there exists something in the introduction that makes me wary of abandoning it. There is a kernel of possibility which constantly reminds me that it contains something of value. This is also true of the introduction to "Black City". But I have thought about these stories and sections so long and so often that the freshness of new insight has waned. I need to complete them and submit them somewhere this year or they will always hold me back, prevent me from writing the stories I could write. 

I am constrained by time and energy, but I do not want to take a jackhammer to the story and roughly carve out where I feel it must go. I know I should heed Stephen King’s advice and pay attention to the circumstance and details of the characters and their problems, but I feel rushed and impatient. There is so much more work to do, but I must recognize and admit that all that work exists in this one as surely as this work can lead to something else. 

———
Identity is what we talk about when we seek to attach meaning to existence. And you cannot get a person to accept something which forces them to interrogate the nature/structure of that attachment. 

You cannot get a person to accept something which is antithetical to the way they construct meaning from existence.

What we’re talking about when we’re talking about identity is the way someone constructs meaning from their personal existence.

Dreams of Amy
It seems that I was wrong when I claimed to be so done with Amy that the prospect of her being with someone else was no longer painful. Last night I had a dream about her. The details are fuzzy now, as they almost always are hours afterward, but what I do remember places us on the floor of some large space. Amy is cutting pieces of paper, completing some large artwork and she is telling me something. I cannot remember what she is telling me because the only thing that stands out is that she mentions she is seeing someone.

Her comment was so slight, so devoid of emphasis, that I almost missed it. "You’re dating someone," I said. She said yes and added that he was black and asked if I wanted to see a picture. But she resigned the offer almost as soon as she gave it. For my part, I did not want to see "a picture." I was still stuck five seconds in the past, trying to work through emotions I had long believed were dealt with. Feelings that I had believed decayed away months ago seemed to only have stolen away in some unacknowledged place, waiting for the appropriate trigger to release them again. Upon Amy’s confession I felt jealousy and an inexplicable fear. What did it mean that she had found someone else? What did it mean that he was black? What did it mean that I felt this way? I have been with many people over the past months. I never told Amy about any of them, but I also had little guilt in all these pursuits. I had, in my mind, moved beyond our break-up and was now doing the natural thing of living in the present. But now I wonder if I was truly done with Amy at those times. Or rather, were these pursuits really just attempts to escape my feelings for Amy by burying them under the bodies of other people.

Whenever I think of Amy, my mind returns to our last month together and three pivotal events which I believed made me turn away from her forever. There was first the time when she told me the stresses and logistics of the move made her "not good at empathy right now." Then there was the time that she told me she wasn’t really interested in having sex. And finally there was the claim that she was no longer sure whether she loved me. If my memory is accurate, I took all of these events in stride. I was still good at empathy. I still wanted to have sex with her. I was still in love. So in her last two weeks in Cambridge I helped her pack and move and tried to sustain the connection that we had cultivated the past year. 

But I was angry. Angry because of all the sacrifices I felt I had made and angry because she had seemed so unwilling to do the same. The anger metastasized and adapted, successfully outpacing all my attempts to contextualize Amy’s action or to consider our relationship on a larger scale. Soon I was doing the terrible and short-sighted thing all poor historians do: rewriting history by reinterpreting it according to the hue of its most recent events. It was not long before I could claim without rancor that never seeing (or even speaking to) Amy again would be a perfectly acceptable conclusion to our relationship. 

I see now that I encouraged the anger. I believed it could save me, believed it could shield me from feelings and events which revealed my impotence. Soon, it had shaded all of my memories with Amy, allowing me to believe that even our moments of happiness were imbued with a latent grey. It was a delusion meant to protect me from the hard-truth of the inescapable dissolution of our relationship, and as such it was a defense that kept me from a more honest appraisal of my own past.

And because the fire of my anger had raged wildly and could not be tamed for months, I had believed that it had destroyed all that was in its path, all that was good, and all that was complicated. But this does not seem to have been true. The fire has died down, and what could not be seen beyond the blazes is now clearly in sight. The fire did not destroy everything, and the things it could not touch must now be dealt with. 

The fact that this was a dream provides little comfort. The day will certainly come, or has already come, when Amy will find someone else and beyond that will tell me about it. In a sense I experienced two awakenings last night: It was only by waking from my dream and returning to proverbial reality that I realized that this reality too was a dream, but one of the most insidious sort, a dream that you can almost never wake from because you have long forgotten you’re having it. In ways and through means that I cannot now see, I will have to do what I had put off for so long: Take the difficult emotional and psychological trek of coming to terms with my current feelings for Amy. 

[//]

The problem is there are real problems we need to solve, problems not at all associated with the various ways we create to satisfy our egoes. 

The work remains to be done. And I knew it would have been an act of profound cowardice to claim it impossible simply because others told me I could not do it. 


I have been slacking somewhat. 

I think I can write three essays each year of about 10 pages each. The essays will almost certainly not come close to my hopes for them, but I can write them and make them a part of reality rather than solely a part of my dreams. 


December 24, 2017 — 2:35 PM
I think over the past semester I have been slacking. There are so many essays I want to write and I have not even begun to make progress towards them. It seems I again have become too attached to the dream of an accomplishment, not sufficiently attached to its actual achievement. With 12 months in the year and a focus of four months per essay, I think I can quite easily write three essays of 10 pages each. This task, I am hoping, would be much simpler than the analogous task for physics/mathematics papers since I will not be constrained by a specific logical structure and should therefore have more directions in which I could take the work. But so far all of this is now just conjecture. In order to make this even more possible I would need to devise a specific plan by which it can be accomplished.

Mathematics, belief, and tautology

Last month I saw two related and interesting posts on the mathematics subforum of stack exchange. One post dealt with belief in mathematics and the other dealt with whether mathematics were a tautology and if so was the entire enterprise useless. 

Mathematics and belief
The way the author phrased the question is important. He or she asked 

"Is a system of axioms different from a system of beliefs? Is there any faith involved in the adoption of axioms? How is a given system of axioms accepted or rejected if not based on blind faith?"

The top voted answer was from Qiaochu Yuan, and I will try my best to paraphase it. (Some one mentioned that Saunders MacLane discussed related ideas in Mathematics: Form and Function)

A system of axioms in mathematics is quite different from a system of beliefs (of the kind which defines a religion) because there is no requirement for belief in mathematics. Yuan characterized the axioms as starting points in a sort of game. Consequently, axioms and definitions are not validated according to some sense of whether or not they are "true" and so we need not ask whether we believe in them.

Thus axioms in of themselves are value neutral; one can choose and develop any system of axioms one want. Where value comes in is when you choose axioms to illustrate an idea. It is only then that you can reject or accept certain axioms according to how well the axioms themselves or the consequent theorems reflect what you know about the larger idea. For example, a set of axioms for euclidean geometry can be chosen to study planar geometry, while another set of axioms—really just the same set with the parallel lines axiom removed—can be chosen to make contact with a more general space of geometries. The question of which axioms are "true" can only be answered outside of our modern interpretation of mathematics. Such questions would specifically concern the physical systems to which these axioms are applied, but within mathematics itself, these axioms have no truth content. 

Yuan mentioned that this explanation was a formalist position (referencing Hilbert’s conception of mathematics). In "formalism" we take mathematical axioms to be the rules of a kind of game which is played through logical deduction, and like the game of chess, for example, one need not have faith in the rules in order to play. In fact the question of faith seems wholly irrelevant to the game itself. For instance, how would you respond to the question "Do you believe in the rules of chess?" 

In Yuan’s words, since axioms have no truth content and instead constitute the starting point for a subject, the most you can say about these axioms is that they do not appropriately represent our world or certain systems in our world.

Understanding why a belief in axioms is not required for mathematics seems to come down to a distinction between the abstraction of mathematics and the concreteness of the physical world. We develop these axioms and the fact that they often have analogs in the physical world may lead one to believe that these axioms must bear fidelity to some physical system, but this is not true. Of course these axioms might have developed intuitively by abstracting away from some physical system, but within the sphere of mathematics alone, a sphere in which a mathematician investigates the theorems extending from these axioms, their connection to a physical world is largely irrelevant. 

Aside: 
I should mention that I do not believe that faith and mathematics are generally antithetical. One may not need faith in sets of axioms, but experience reveals that one certainly does need a larger sort of metaphysical kind of faith in order to do mathematics. I’m talking specifically about faith in an ordered system which one believs can be made intelligible through logical deduction. It is not at all clear why such a system exists or why one should believe that one can successfully explore it and so it requires faith in order to believe success is possible. For example, I think Andrew Wiles needed to have a huge degree of faith in the structure of mathematics (and not to mention himself) in order to pursue for ten years a proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem.

Mathematics as Tautology 
Here is the next question. The user asked if mathematics was one big tautology. He/She asserted that mathematics was a deductive system and thus it started with arbitrary axioms and then derived theorems from those axioms. But the "derivation" of these theorems amounts to simply a "string of equivalences" where each result can be traced back to the axioms. Thus, since every new theorem can be traced back to the starting axioms, in what sense can results in mathematics be said to introduce novel ideas? 

In response to this question, rather than critiquing the user’s more objectionable claim that mathematics was one big tautology, many jumped on the claim "mathematics is a deductive system" and pointed out that mathematics was not a deductive system but used deduction much more extensively than science disciplines. This was the brunt Ittay Weiss’s, the top-voted answerer’s, position. 

Being able to prove things is not the only relevant skill in mathematics. Instead, Weiss said mathematics is concerned mainly with ideas. These ideas are expressed through axioms and then more fully investigated through logical deduction. In this way, Weiss asserted that mathematics is not merely a deductive system, but it rather used deduction as a means to achieve its larger objective of exploring ideas about structure, change, and geometry. Weiss mentioned that this was Lakatos’s position: Logic is not synonymous with mathematics, but is rather a tool for mathematics. 

In Weiss’s view the ideas one tries to capture in mathematics "transcend the deductive system," and the deductive system is there to "help us find the consequences of the axioms" and to be able to, if necessary, compare those consequences to the original idea we were trying to capute. 

I thought this was really interesting and was a good answer even if it didn’t really contest the author’s claim that mathematics is a tautology. In fact Weiss agreed that mathematics was a tautology but said it was beside the point! (Although it seems that he was defining tautology as "a string of equivalences," which is a definition that does not exactly match the colloquial definition I’m critiquing.)

Definition of Tautology: A tautology is a logical statement in which the conclusion is equivalent to the premise. More colloquially, it is a formula in propositional calculus which is always true. 

On my part, I’ve often wondered about the "string of equivalences" nature of mathematics derivations. Namely, whether these equivalences were from some perspective trivial, and whether humans could not see the triviality due to our current cognitive limits. For example, the fundamental theorem of calculus might seem profound, but who is to say it is more profound than the binomial theorem (which seems obvious) or the expansion of (a+b)^2 (which seems trivial).

In the end, I am limited by my experience and I have to conclude that it does not feel exactly right to see mathematics derivation as merely a string of equivalences. Different theorems have different structures and thus use axioms and methods of logical deduction in various ways, ways which are not manifest in the axioms themselves. Thus, results which are in a sense derivable from the axioms can nevertheless be impossible to see within the axioms alone. It may indeed be the limits of human cognition which make us see ceratin theorems as deep and interesting and others as trivial, but in either case I does not seems accurate to depict these theorems as "merely equivalent" to their nascent axioms. 

————
The OP responding to his own question summarizes his new found perspective: 

"It doesn't matter that, in some technical sense, everything might be traced back to axiomatic roots. That is just how deduction works, you can't fault a logical system for being logical. But at each derivative step, we have a new idea, that is the essential point! Even in an equality which seems to be the biggest triviality, the LHS and the RHS represent two different ideas, and their being equal a third. To reiterate, the deduction is a rigorous, "tautological" (not in the strict sense) system; but in each each step that we take, that brings us further and further away from the axioms, a new idea is birthed or represented. It is the concepts contained in each theorem or identity that are at the heart of math, and not the logical steps between them. Those logical steps are just due to the nature of deduction, and are of necessity if we are to employ the tool of deduction."

The Cross 
Is this what is meant by the "cross of redemption"? That Baldwin or any artist bears the burden and the privilege of being responsible to the anonymous many and thus this artist must be better than he is, have more faith, have more courage, in order to redeem himself and through the process, redeem all those who do not know him but depend on him nevertheless?

Proofs and Refutations - Part I


What is the purpose of mathematics? Is it to generate proofs of theorems from starting axioms and auxiliary definitions? This is what Lakatos sees as the formalist perspective on mathematics. He identifies it as a "metamathematics" which is concerned with 

"an abstraction of mathematics in which mathematical theories are replaced by formal systems, proofs by certain sequences of well-formed formulae, definitions by 'abbreviatory devices’ which are 'theoretically dispensible’ but 'typographically convenient’."

What precisely does this mean? It is not exactly clear, but it seems to refer to a more mechanical interpretation of mathematics one less concerned with exploring ideas than with generating careful ways to prove theorems. Lakatos states this metamathematics was promulgated by Hilbert and ostensibly had the larger goal of axiomatizing all of mathematics so that all theorems could be connected to (and hence proved from) agreed upon foundations. 

In "Proofs and Refutations", Lakatos contests this perspective by using an extended dialogue to show that mathematics is not precisely concerned with proving theorems but rather with understanding definitions, conjectures, axioms, and the ideas which underly them. The process that one takes to develop this understanding often requires proofs—or at least attempts at constructing them—but to take proving theorems as the most important element of mathematics would be to confuse the method by which an answer is sought with the answer itself. A statement at the end of his introduction summarizes his perspective. 

"[This study’s] aim is to elaborate the point that informal, quasi-empirical, mathematics does not grow through a monotonous increase of the number of indubitably established theorems but through the incessant improvement of guesses by speculation and criticism, by the logic of proofs and refutations."

To be reductionist, while Hilbert’s formalism is preoccupied with theorems and proofs, Lakatos’s perspective is preoccupied with ideas and conjectures (a conjecture is roughly defined as a theorem without a proof), and proofs are used to explore the latter. 

Thus, by Hilbert’s program (or at least a caricature of it), someone who constructs a flawed proof of a theorem has failed in his goal. But in Lakatos’s program, a flawed proof might still be mathematically useful if it leads to a deeper comprehension of the theorem’s definitions or its regimes of validity. Lakatos’s Teacher admonition of a student provides a pithy quote in this regard:

You are interested only in proofs which 'prove' what they have set out to prove. I am interested in proofs even if they do not accomplish their intended task. Columbus did not reach India but he discovered something quite interesting. 

I would say this is an egalitarian depiction of mathematical work. In Lakatos’s mind one has value if one can successfully engage in any part of the process of exploring the idea whether that be developing a proof, pointing out the flaws in the proof, or providing definitions to save interesting proofs. 

But I can’t say Lakatos’s focus on "conjectures" really reflects my mathematical experience. There have been a few times when I have sought out a proof of some identity I had believed to be true (the continuum limit of thermal permutations work being the most recent example), but most of my derivations are not seeking to justify something I already know to be true, but rather to find something I believe exists. Lakatos makes the claim that this is not how mathematics should be done, but it is certainly how I have done mathematical physics for as long as I have been doing it. Perhaps, then, mathematical physics is not under the purview of what Lakatos considers mathematics? Perhaps I am severely mischaracterizing his argument? 

In any case, this first part of "Proofs and Refutations" is really interesting. We have a teacher and many pupils discussing the Euler Identity(?)/Definition(?) V-E+F = 2. The Teacher presents the conjecture, develops a proof, and all of them cycle through local counterexamples (i.e., counterexamples which kill the proof but not the conjecture), redefinitions, rejections of redefinitions, global counter examples (i.e., counterexamples which kill the conjecture but not the proof), and so on. By the end, the class has developed a rather complicated, but arguably more complete, understanding of a "polyhedron" is. In a way this more sophisticated understanding could be seen as the true fruits of their labor: They sought out a proof of a experientially inferred conjecture and in the process built a refined understanding of the class of objects which first led to the conjecture. This result certainly reflects Lakatos’s point that the purpose of proof (and counterexamples and definitions/redefinitions) is to develop ideas. 

Lakatos makes this point clear in the Teacher’s final statement. Throughout the discussion his pupils were raising counterexamples both local and global which led to more than half a dozen definitions of polyhedra and one definition of a polygon. All these definitions were mostly developed to rule out various strange counterexamples of the Euler polyhedron formula, a process the teacher termed "monster barring." Near the end, a pupil who was particularly zealous in monster barring claims that the task no longer interests him because it is clear that monsters always exist. Why, he asks his classmates, can’t they appreciate the beauty in Euler’s formula without trying to tear it down (This is a paraphrase of Delta’s final comment). In response, the Teacher commends his idealism but admonishes his shortsightedness. The Teacher, notes that one could eliminate "monsters" through a adroit but possibly arbitrary redefinition of a polyhedron or of the terms defining a polyhedron. But counterexamples, he states, should be treated more respectfully because our objective is not merely to prove what we have set out to prove: "I am not perturbed at finding a counterexample to a 'proved' conjecture; I am even willing to set out to 'prove' a false conjecture!"

A Dearth of Ideas

Despite my recent successes, I realize that soon I will have to confront a fear I first glimpsed years ago. 
When I was in high school, I feared University assignments because I was afraid that problem sets, which were a major part of one’s grade, could not reliably be completed on time. This fear was brought on by y own experience with taking days to solve one physics or math problem. So I wondered, for these assignments, what if you failed to solve any of the problems? Or what if you could solve them but could not do so in the requisite time? 

Upon entering college, I discovered that these concerns were not the existential dilemma’s I thought they were. For virtually all my class assignments, I found that I  class could solve most of the problems on my own, and those I could not solve alone could still progress through the help of the teaching staff. However, as I better understood the conditions which obviated this particular fear, a new fear came into view. I knew that research scientists were expected (required?) to publish papers, but what if they had nothing to publish? What if they had, not merely a lack of an abilitiy to solve problems, but simply no ideas as to what problems they should solve? What if, quite simply, these investigators eventually ran out of ideas?

These questions fortunately spurred me toward trying to understand how ideas for investigations develop, but inspirt of all my writing on the topic, the concern has lingered. 

Now that I’m coming to the end of the combinatorics and biomolecules project (I hope!), I’m left wondering what comes next. Will anything even come at all? These concerns have subtly existed in the background of my work for the past few years. They reside like a body hidden beneath the floor boards, like something which needed to be dealt with eventually but which could be currently ignored because there was other work to do. 

But, perhaps here is one perspective as to why the concern is unfounded, or at least its fruition preventable. 

As surely as I am alive and thinking, it seems unlikely that I will stop having new ideas. The analogy that comes to mind is my conversations with Amy. Amy and I learned a lot about one another very rapidly, and after such a period of quickly established intimacy couples often find they have nothing more to talk about. This was not so with us. Each of us was engaging with the world through books, the news, and our own work, and we brought each of these engagements with us whenever we came together. So in our conversations there was always something new to talk about or something old to revisit more carefully. And this was primarily because when we encountered something from the external world which resonated or generally affected us somehow, we brought this thing into our internal world so that it could both augment our understanding of that external world and also bring us closer together.


I imagine my relationship with ideas and physics could be similar. My own ideas result from a dialogue between myself and the ideas which exist in the world. As long as I continue that dialogue, continue to interrogate its terms, assumptions, and analyses, I think I will always find new starting points for investigations. In clarity, this dialogue was what first led to my analytical IMDB solution years ago. So I think I can have similar dialogues again and continue to do so. 

Of course, to increase my likelihood of staying "engaged" I should be more specific about how exactly I should stay engaged. Phrased differently, how can I keep myself immersed in ideas and keep myself constantly evaluating and implementing ideas?

Some possible ways
— Read papers and write soft-questions concerning qualitative ideas in the paper and hard-questions concerning quick calculations you can do. Hopefully the quick calculations lead to more questions. 
— Realize that new and interesting questions can come from anywhere.
— Get that first model down on paper. This is so you have something concrete to build from. 
— Ask yourself whether you can abstract anything away from a discussion and model it independently of the situation the discussion describes. 
— Learn a new subject! (A new physics subject is like a new way of looking at the world. Combined with your prior knowledge, it might present new questions you can ask about that world.)

——Loose Ends

Your own ideas result from a dialogue between yourself and the ideas which exist in the world. As long as you continue that dialogue, continue to interrogate its terms, assumptions, and analyses, I think you will always find new starting points for investigations.

I imagine my relationship with ideas and physics could be similar. If I stay engaged and connected and interested, I will always have ideas. Such engagement will allow me to see the gaps in epistemic networks  and these gaps will lead to more problems and more investigations. That is what I did three years ago which led to all this work. I think I can do it again and continue to do it.

The uniqueness of combinatorics
As I seem to keep repeating, my combinatorics and biomolecules work is going well. So well in fact that I am afraid it is all a fluke and that I will never do work like this again. This is the main reason I believe this. Combinatorics is an especially clean area of mathematics which is amenable to computational checks. By clean I mean that in combinatorics there is not a large degree of abstraction or tricky properties like continuity or differentiability. At the end of the day, it concerns counting the number of elements in sets which are constrained by various properties and this makes one’s work more analytically tractable. 
 And the fact we are "just counting" allows many of my calculations to be rendered computationally. While working through my various projects there have been countless (excuse the pun) times when I would be stuck at a point in a derivation, be forced to guess a follow up step, would then check the consistency computationally, and only after all this go through the process of trying to formally derive the result. Thus running a program gave me confidence in an answer that I did not have to formally derive before hand. Alternatively, after a long derivation (of a partition function, for example) I would often check my analytical results against their corresponding computational simulations. When inconsistencies occurred I was thus directed to look more carefully through my derivation to see where a mistake was made. 

In short, the fact that much of this work was couched in the methods of combinatorics provided me with a singular opportunity to do analytically transparent and computationally verifiable work. If I do not continue working with projects of this kind, I don’t think I will find conditions like these again, and so I don’t think I will be as successful. 

Counter argument
Your experience suggests, you have a sufficient analytical foundation to successfully do whatever kind of work you want do. To say that you were especially successful in this case because combinatorics is somehow analytically simple and because you can check results computationally is to link things which are not related. All the decay rate and cross section calculations you successfully completed in quantum field theory were much more complicated than the calculations you completed in this combinatorics work.  So although the simplicity of a calculation may make it easier to complete, you are still capable of performing involved calculations. 

And these calculations, too, had ways you could check them. With combinatorics you could use computation, and when you’re dealing with equations of continuous variables you can use dimensional analysis, limiting cases, and solutions of special cases. 

Moreover, you’re mathematical background is quite wide. Throughout your education, you’ve dealt with solving discrete master equations, solving partial differential equations, Feynman diagrams, Gaussian approximations, so it is not true that you have some special skill with combinatorics, especially considering that much of your work relied on identities collected/derived by Gould. 

I do agree that your work in the past months/year has been special, but I do not think what was special had to do with the mathematical tools you were using. Rather I think was was special was that instead of using your analytical skills to answer questions other people were interested in, you used your skills to answer questions you were interested in. 

So I don’t think you need to assume that other areas of mathematical physics are closed off to you. You should of course  do what you can to improve your technical sophistication in the directions you desire, but I think if you want to again have the feeling that you had while working on this project, you will primarily need to do a better job of listening to your internal compass.

Conversation with My Father
Hours before I returned to Cambridge, my dad and I spoke about my first few years at Harvard. The lateness of the conversation was partly my fault. I had been postponing an admission that I thought would taint my remaining days in New Orleans so I waited and waited until we only had a few hours left. The admission was that I had over the course of two days withdrawn $2000 from the ATM in Walgreens. I was trying to accumulate enough cash so we could buy a car by the time I left, or at least so that he’d have the cash to do so if I left without us finding one. Many of the cars we searched for were used and likely would have required cash payments, and I only had a debit card issued by a credit union (and not a bank) and so there was no chance for me to withdraw money the more sensible way. My father did not want me to visit multiple ATMs to withdraw cash for him. There was of course the issue that I would be giving cash to him, but he probably knew this couldn’t dissuade me, so he emphasized safety. "You don’t know who can be watching you," he said. "Someone, a cashier or a customer, can see you withdraw that kind of money and then they can call their friends to jump you on your way home." I imagined the scenario he described. It was a possibility of course, and so any attempt at withdrawal had that scenario as one known risk. But I considered the risk of losing $1000 versus my desire to give my father that $1000 and I decided that the former was an OK risk to take if at all made the latter possible. So over two days I walked from home to Walgreens to withdraw $1000 each day. I eventually stopped when it was clear we would not buy a car during my week in New Orleans, and I thus could send the remaining money through wire transfer. But that still left me with the $2000 I had collected. I had to give it to my father eventually, but I didn’t want to face the conversation and questions that followed. 

My flight was for 7AM Friday morning, and after I finished packing at around 11PM the night before, I collected the money, separated it into five $400 envelopes and made my way down the stairs. I handed the money to my father, telling him that I had withdrawn the money a week ago. "Thank you," he said. "How much is it?" I told him the amount. "That is a lot of money," he said sitting down on the couch near the window. He was silent for a time contemplative. "We thank God for your and your sister’s help. If it were not for you I’m not sure what we would do." He did not say this happily. He was grateful but he sounded more pained than anything else. "I would have hoped things would have been different now," he told me. "I would have hoped that I would be buying you and your sister a car. You two are starting your lives. You shouldn’t be burdened with my situation." I had heard this before, but I did not really listen until then. 
Perhaps because I did not want to listen. Perhaps I did not want to truly acknowledge my father’s shame and pain because this would force me to change who I thought my father was. It would complicate him in ways that could not be useful to my desire for safety and protection, in ways which would dismantle the fiction that I need not be responsible for all decisions in my life. 

What must it be like to be an adult in your early 60s with two adult children who you are financially dependent on at a point when you believed you would be the one providing them with the rewards of materialism and a middle class American life? Believing I was more of a burden than a benefit to people I loved, I know what I might be led to do in such a situation. But I am a coward, and my father is not, and for that I am grateful. He is pained, but he still has hope, long after I might have already given up. 

In truth, I should have been more prepared for how my father would react to the money. I had wanted to give him the money and then move as quickly as possible from the inevitable conversation into another, one which was lighter, more superficial, one not tinged with the recognition of the state my father and mother’s lives had fallen to. 

But of course the money would just be another reminder of his current state. Of course it would just be another reminder of how reality has not yet caught up with his dreams. But I was blinded partly by my own shame. I now realize that the year I spent in New Orleans was necessary. And yet this realization does little to eliminate the remnants of shame I felt at that time. I did not have a job, I hardly ever left the house. I was well into adulthood and still sponging off the sacrifices of my parents. Sacrifices they had made all my life and which they gladly continued to make as I worked to figure out how that life should be lived. Once during that year, I remember going to the grocery store with my father and seeing him pay for the groceries we bought with food stamps. This had shocked me, but what did I expect? I was bringing no income to the house and neither was my father, but we were both eating. Where did I think the money was coming from? I returned home to look at my MIT credit union account. It had about $600 in it, hardly enough to even pay our mortgage for a month. My friends had scattered across Silicon Valley, starting new lives and slowly collecting their first six-figure salaries, and yet here I was in the bedroom where I had grown up, still struggling with how to be an adult. I, never being one to be lulled by financial incentives, had turned away from any sort of tech, finance, or consulting work, believing that physics was ultimately more fulfilling. But at that moment I would have given much of my abstruse knowledge of high energy physics to be able to provide for the family which had for so long provided for me. 

My father and mother had taken care of me my entire life. My sister too. Whatever disadvantages this society had assigned to me seem to pale in comparison to the advantages provided by my family. Racism, both systemic and individual, homophobia, and cages of masculinity have failed to dictate my life in the ways they so often do, and I know without hyperbole that for all the privileges I am supposedly denied, the privilege I have of being the youngest member of my particular family has bestowed upon me more advantages, by far, than that accorded to large swaths of the human race. 

I am now four years away from that time, but the shame is not gone. And I was so focused on cleansing myself of it, that I ignored my father’s own shame. Still I had to tell him something to make him understand why my giving him the money was necessary and why it was my way of returning a favor rather than making a donation. I told him that one of the only reasons I eventually came to Harvard was because I knew the university would provide me with a stipend that I could send to him and my mother. In those early days of that fateful August, I had not even wished to attend the university anymore, but thanks to his exhortation that it was an opportunity which I would likely regret not having taken, I went. I realize now that his claim was true: Looking at all my notebooks collected from high school, I know that the boy I was at 16 would never have forgiven the man I was at 21 for succumbing to fear and running away from Harvard. I was bereft of any sense of identity, confidence, and hope, but I packed and got on a plane and arrived at Harvard unwilling, but left with no choice but to, begin a new life, and this was largely thanks to my father. Knowing how close I came to a frightful edge, knowing that I was only saved from that edge by my father, fills me with a confusing mix of gratitude, humility, and terror. My life has been so dependent on other people. I don’t know how I would have survived otherwise. 

I gave my father this explanation, and he nodded. "You scared your mother and I when you told us that." I suppose this makes sense: What parents would not be frightened when their child says, with no other job prospects, that he no longer wants to attend the most prestigious university in the world? It might have been OK, had I had reasonable alternatives, but the only alternative I could picture was me hanging from a tree. 

"Why," he asked me, "didn’t you want to go?" It was when he asked this that I realized I had never told him, never really explained all those fears and anxieties which had washed me out to a vast sea from which I almost did not return. So I told him. I told him about my final years at MIT, about desperately wanting to do research and then finding it unfulfilling and deadening. I told him about my deep-seeded fear that Harvard would be more of the same. I told him about my attempt to skirt that future, about my attempt during that year in New Orleans to build the skills necessary to carve out my own path in research. I told him about my failure in doing so, and the subsequent decline that failure engendered. 

He had two questions: Did I find my fears realized when I came to Harvard, and do I still feel the way I felt all those years ago? I answered the second question first. I now felt leagues better about myself and about physics, but, I admitted, that my fears were realized if not immediately. I told him what I had constantly replayed to myself since I joined the Shakhnovich group. I still was awed by the improbability of it all. I came to Harvard spent my first semester taking classes and started research at the beginning of my second semester. I told my father that I again found that research a vacant and alienating experience, but I did it anyway because I felt I had no other recourse. I told him that eight months into the project, my supervisor told me he would be taking on another student. My father shook his head, dismayed at this. Being the good soldier, I continued working with this supervisor, wishing at least to get a paper out of all my efforts. But come January, when I had begun drafting the paper, this supervisor had told me that we were not nearly close enough to the end, to begin drafting anything. This dismissal, I told my father, evaporated any will I had to continue working on the project. 

So I had accurately appraised the dangers, but I had not accurately appraised my ability to respond to them. Much of what I thought would be present in the system of graduate education was indeed there—the classwork which had little to do with the practice of research, the alienation from personal interests, the resulting loneliness—but what I did not anticipate was that the skills I had been trying and failing to build all those years ago would manifest when I most needed them to. 

It was shortly after that meeting with my supervisor that I made it my mission to complete a draft of a problem I had been thinking of for a few years. After completing the draft, I told him I had sent it out to various professors ultimately resulting in the collaboration I currently had. "Was this problem related to the work you published earlier this year?" I was surprised he remembered. "Yes," I said. 

My father took all this in. "I’m sorry you had to experience that," he said. "Something like that could just cause someone to drop out." He shook his head. "These people," by which he meant white people, Americans, or generally anyone implicated in the racial caste systems of our world, "when they see someone who looks like them, they are always so encouraging and supportive. But when they see a black person, they don’t care. They want you to fail" 

My father then told me many stories that I had heard before, stories which at that moment were newly tinted owing to their relation to the story I just told. He had studied medicine in Bulgaria and had constantly informed me that that was the first country where he had experienced racism. He told me of a friend who had left medical school and returned to Nigeria after the first year because he was tired of that racism. The friend was working as a government clerk when my father had come to America. "They called us monkeys," my father said. Once when my father was taking an oral exam on neurophysiology, an examiner looked up from his sheet and asked "You, what do you know about the brain?" by which the examiner meant "What could you possibly know about the brain?" My father had told the examiner to ask him anything he wanted about the brain. The examiner obliged and my father answered all the questions correctly. Still the examiner gave him a failing grade. My father was only saved by another examiner who saw my father’s performance and boosted his grade to a passing one, which was still far from the perfect grade he deserved. I might be reluctant to do so because of my relation to my father, but one could certainly question the veracity of such stories. I was not there, and neither were you dear reader. But this is the nature of all stories through which we live vicariously. We can question them, but we must do so intelligently and not by some relativistic default. What incentive would my father have to embellish? To paint himself as an illustrious student? I don’t think so. He had told me many stories about his failures. He wasn’t good at humanities subjects like English or History. He had even failed Yoruba. He was also the last student in his cohort in medical school to learn Bulgarian. Perhaps, then he wants to paint the all white (whatever that means) people of the world as intrinsically racist? This too has counter-evidence. My father has never said that all white people had this particular disease. In his time at Bulgaria, my father had good relationships with some Professors there. The one professor who saved my father’s grade wanted him to work in the university hospital after he graduated. Another professor, upon my father, helped my mother graduate early so she and my father could begin their residencies around the same time. "There are a few good ones among them," he told me, "but you have to still be careful."

It was my father’s experiences in Bulgaria which encouraged him to move to America. He rationalized the Bulgarians’ problems with race as due to ignorance. "They had never seen black people before. But I knew there were black people living in America, so I thought it would be better."

In America, it was not better. "Americans were just as racist," he admitted, "but the way they do it is less out in the open, it is more hidden. Their racism is shown in the way they work around you or the way they try to stop you from progressing." This was a rather advanced statement, one I did not believe I would ever hear my father articulate. He was speaking of a distinction between individual and systemic racism, the way that while both are destructive it is only the former which advertises itself as such. 

Why didn’t my father just return to Nigeria like his friend? He had a medical degree. He answered this before I could ask. "Nigeria is filled with many intelligent people," he explained. "Nigerians are brilliant, so I don’t know why the government can function so that electricity stays on continuously for more than two weeks." I had always believed my father hated Nigeria, but here was a nuance I had never heard. What he felt was not hatred, but disappointment. "Basic things, we don’t have and it is because of corruption. You would see a government official with 37 cars while there are people in the street who cannot eat." This latter point was arguably the story of the world. It certainly was the story of America. In many cities in this country, there are many many people who cannot spend more than $100 a day on food who live mere blocks from those who have summer houses in far away states. Wealth and income inequality is par for the course for human history. What American society has managed to do that Nigeria (or at least the Nigeria of my father’s memories) has not is develop its infrastructure to such a point that this inequality is tolerable if not completely acceptable. 

My father finished his story about Bulgaria by returning to my own. Year ago he had wanted to prepare my sister and I for all the racism we would likely face. He told me of a discussion he had with my mother when my sister and I were just starting elementary school. Seeing how we performed, seeing how "serious" we were with our education—a seriousness I had always attributed to my parents efforts and not anything cultivated by my sister and I—he told my mom that he and her should tell us sooner rather than later what we would likely face around white people. Namely, the ignorance, the latent and not so latent hostility, the disparities in expectation which translated into disparities in evaluation and outcome. My mother had disagreed with him, believing it wrong to inculcate children in pre-emptive hatred. My father had counter-argued that you were not inculcating your child if you were simply telling them of the dangers, very real dangers, they would be facing their entire lives. My mother won the battle in name only. My sister and I were not told of such racial disparities until we were much older, but throughout our childhood I picked up on, and my sister must have as well,  certain comments and complaints my parents made about their interactions with their white colleagues. By the time I reached high school, these comments had mad it clear that my sister’s and my academic performance were not achievements we should take for granted for they were achievements that virtually no one else would. 

I must admit it is difficult to apply this knowledge in practice. The nature of being part of any marginalized group in this country, or perhaps anywhere, is one of being constantly tormented by apparitions. You feel afflicted, and you recognize this affliction is somehow coming from a place external to you, but you cannot see it, and when you look closely it seems to be made transparent through interpretation and simplification.

This is to say, I have not, because I simply could not have, interpreted all of my trials at Benjamin Franklin, MIT, and at Harvard through the lens of race. All of them are filled with gaps which can be filled with innocuous explanations, imbued with ambiguities and degrees which can paint me as paranoid as surely as it can paint others as latently prejudiced. However, some cases are clearer than others. For example, I do not know if Mr. Ferris was certainly trying to keep me in my place when he discouraged me  from taking AP Physics my Junior year, but I certainly know other Juniors had taken AP Physics before.  It is also not clear that my freshman advisors and the woman who headed the petition committee were reacting to confidence they felt a black student should not have when they denied me the chance to take quantum mechanics my first semester at MIT and to later get credit for electronics in my second semester, but I know that freshman had taken and received credit for much more advanced courses in the past. 

But how about more recent events? Was what happened with my first supervisor at Harvard the result of racism? I do not know. Alternative explanations abound. Perhaps I had conveyed unintentionally my disinterest in the project? Perhaps I wasn’t really performing as well as I thought I was? Or, returning to my father’s narrative, perhaps unconsciously internalized stereotypes on his part led him to believe I had less intrinsic ability than his other student?

These questions remained unanswered for me then, and they perhaps always will. My father again thanked me for the money. When I first gave him the envelopes he had shifted them from hand to hand, seemingly unsure of what to do with them. He seemed better now. I was afraid of this conversation, but it had made what I done easier for him to accept perhaps because our discussion had given the act some necessary context. This conversation had ended, and I now can’t remember what we talked about next. It was now past 12 AM and it was getting later and later. But I stayed up with my father and watched Part 3 and the first few minutes of Part 4 of Henry Louis Gates documentary series on Africa’s civilizations. I went to sleep at 2AM, two hours before I would get up and prepare for the flight which would return me to Cambridge.

Notes on "String Theory and Quantum Gravity", Chapter 11 of Higher Speculation by Kragh

Kragh outlines various perspectives on String Theory and Quantum Gravity. Most of these I have heard of before, but he does clarify the question that String Theory poses about theoretical physics. The question is whether aesthetics and mathematical consistency are sufficient metrics to accept a physical theory in lieu of experimental evidence. Steven Weinberg’s opinion is that they are. Sheldon Glashow’s opinion is that they are not. In Weinberg’s eyes, why should theoretical development of physics stop simply because we have not yet probed the energy regimes relevant to the new physics of our models. In Glashow’s, the pre-dominance of arguments by beauty were turning theoretical physics into an intellectual game. In a damning statement, Glashow claimed that the end-game of string theory would be the replacement of science (in which string theory is clearly excluded) with faith. 

Of course, I agree with Glashow, but it is interesting that Glashow and Weinberg as contemporaries and thus as two physicists ostensibly trained in the same intellectual paradigm have come to different conclusions about String theory. Kragh mentions that it was perhaps Glashow’s work on grand unification theories which made him especially critical of String Theory which was the new competition back in the late 80s. But Kragh’s example of GUTs provides even more evidence for Glashow’s argument that aesthetics are insufficient. 

I think the SU(5) unification of the fundamental forces would be particularly beautiful, but experimental measurements of the proton decay life-time seem to have ruled such unifications out. Our aesthetic sensibilities are insufficient guides in divining what is really happening in our physical universe. Maybe these sensibilities can better help us formulate the question, but, even (or perhaps especially) when we cannot find the answers to those questions, it is a mistake to assume these sensibilities represent the answers themselves.In short, the world is messy. It rarely conforms to the most elegant representations of the mathematical models we build to study it.

In the last section Kragh discusses Loop Quantum Gravity. He showed an interesting table which suggested that LQG theorists comprised roughly 1/5 of the Quantum Gravity community in the late 90s while string theorists comprised a bit more than 1/2. 

The contest between String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity provides a good example of Kuhn’s notion of competing paradigms. In String theory gravitation appears as "just another field" while in LQG the equations are spacetime-independent.  According to the practitioners of the former, the appearance of gravitation was a clear signal that the theory was correct. However, according to the practitioners of the latter background-independence was a more important goal to pursue. Across the two subjects are different standards of correctness and different values, thus leading the string theorist and the loop quantum gravity theorist to somewhat talk past one another when they discuss the advantages of their particular formalism.

A Vessel for Mathematics 
This question of whether mathematical ideas are discovered or invented misses one other perspective. The focus of the latter two labels is implicitly on the discoverer or inventor, the one who either through seeking out or creating adds something new to the world. But there is another way to see such things, a way which places the individual as a passive rather than active participant in the process.  The way I see my own mathematical work is that I am neither creator nor inventor. I am instead a vessel through which mathematical ideas flow from that untethered metaphysical world of structure and logic into the physical world we occupy every day. How well those ideas flow through me and become part of the physical world depends almost entirely on how willing I am to let go of how I want to see and use the ideas and on how willing I am I took beyond interpretations, both simple and convoluted, to allow the idea speak and exist for itself.

Various human vices can corrupt this process. Laziness can make us stop short. Cowardice can make us unwilling to search where there is uncertainty. A lack of focus can make us distracted by easier pursuits. A lack of integrity can pervert our values to fit frames of acceptability. Faithlessness can lull us into believing in the futility of the entire work itself.

Notes on "The Art of Problem Solving" by A. Gardiner in The Princeton Companion to Mathematics

Near the start of the piece is an interesting quote by Gian-Carlo Rota: 

Why don’t we tell the truth? No one has the faintest idea how the process…works, and in calling it a "process" we may be already making a dangerous assumption. 

There have been many critiques about how published scientific work hides the actual process through which that work was completed, but here Rota is criticizing deeper. In what sense, he asks, can we label the work that we do as a process anyway? I always through the term "process" was quite appropriate for how scientific and mathematical work is completed because it’s vagueness well mirrors the amorphous nature of the work itself. The work is a process instead of a procedure or an algorithm because it requires that we keep sight on the goal while simultaneously being flexible in how we reach it and even in how we define what reaching it means. But it appears Rota thinks that even the word "process" is too definite, suggesting we understand more about what we’re doing than we actually do. I would have to read the source of this quote to get a better idea of what he means but a naive guess suggests that the things mathematicians actually do is perhaps better described as a dialectic, a cycle of proposal contradiction of the type described in Lakatos’s Proofs and Refutations. But isn’t this too a sort of process?

Gardiner goes on to characterize mathematics as "a largely unexplored 'mental universe'. He divides the mathematicians who explore this universe into two kinds defined by the kind of work they do. 

	- System builders
	- Beach combers

The system builders are those who identify entirely new mathematical fields or find novel ways to connect  existing mathematical fields. Gardiner states that these builders could be initially motivated by a specific problem, but this motivation soon flowers into a grander intent to elucidate the relations between mathematics at large. 

Rather than launching out into new territory, the mathematical beachcombers works more to study the contours and gaps within existing mathematical knowledge. As system builders create new frameworks for understanding mathematics, the mathematical beachcomber goes through their work systematically to fill in holes where necessary. 

Gardiner’s division seems very similar to Timothy Gowers’s division of mathematicians into theory builders (like Grothendieck) and problem solvers (like Erdös), and it’s also quite similar to Dyson’s Isaiah Berlin’s reference of scientists as either hedgehogs (intently focused on building the theory of a single field, like Einstein) or foxes (flexibly moving from field to field solving interesting problems, like Feynman). Similar Gowers and Dyson, Gardiner argues that both styles are necessary to mathematics. However, he doesn’t seem to entertain the possibility that both styles can be present in the same person at once. I’m sure it’s possible in mathematics because it is surely possible in physics. Chandrasekhar is a physicist who I feel embodies both spirits seeing as over the course of many books he worked through many different areas of Astrophysics all the while building up deeper theories of Astrophysics itself. 

Continuing with this characterization of mathematical activity, Gardiner quotes Connes. Connes depicted a mathematician’s work as occurring on three levels: 

1st level: Faculty of calculation.
2nd level: Adaptation and application. 
3rd level: Unconscious solution. 

First, this seems to me a strange set of divisions to make. I can see how the first and second levels are related by whether calculations are applied to existing systems or knew systems, respectively, but the third level seems to concern how solutions are found. If I were rewriting these levels, I would replace Unconscious solution with "Creation of new calculations" as in creating new methods of solving problems apart from the methods learned in the first level or merely applied in the second level. This level framing would bring this description closer to that of Bloom’s taxonomy of learning. 

But let’s consider the divisions as they are stated. Gardiner describes the first level as a focus on developing fluency and competence in using well-known techniques in standard ways. This is the focus of much of secondary and university higher education and it is the presumed starting point for any discussion of the art of problem solving. 

Gardiner states that the second level comprises much of the "serious mathematics that mathematicians engage in on a daily basis." Such mathematical work consists of (i) challenges to cultivate the skills of the young mathematician and (ii) "genuine research problems". Years ago it would have struck me as strange that research problems existed merely a level above the level which included homework problems, but now I realize this is accurate. Indeed, in a mathematician’s/physicist’s first solved problem—often assigned by an experienced advisor—the young investigator would likely be just applying the techniques she learned in her course to a new question. 

This is the case because there are two criteria that are necessary in order to have a publishable research problem: First, the problem must be new and second the problem should be of interest to the scientific community. I think my undergraduate advisor Professor Rajagopal told me that the problem need only be new and soluble, but I think solubility is par for the course for any publishable problem-solution pair.

Aside: Have I ever solved a homework problem which was more difficult than any of the problems I solved in my published research? A shallow appraisal would suggest the answer is yes given that all of my published research concerns problems I have successfully (in some way) solved, but I have not successfully solved every homework problem I have received. And this is not merely from lack of trying; many times I simply could not solve the problem under the stated constraints. But it is partly the nature of these constraints which make the comparison between homework problem and published research inappropriate. For homework problems there is often a two-week or one-week time constraint which limits how long you have to think about and explore the problem. There are no such constraints (or at least the constraints are more nebulous and flexible) in actual research. Another difference is that for homework the problem/question is defined for you, and in research half of the work of an investigation is trying to determine the question you should be asking apart from the question which initiated the investigation. In these two ways, time-constraints and the problem definition, homework problems are sufficiently different from research problems as to preclude intelligible comparison. 

Next, Gardiner warns against an inclination toward treating Connes’s third level as too nebulous to describe. He quotes Kac’s remark about the work of genius being highly nonlinear and even magical, and thus impenetrable. Gardiner disagrees with this noting that Poincaré (who Gardiner feels is deserving of the label "genius") successfully subjected his insights to analysis and study, and thereby increased the mathematical community’s understanding of how such insights occur. Moreover, Gardiner believes there is a clear parallel between the way the best mathematicians operate on this third level and the way students operate "out of their depth" on simpler problems. 

Gardiner then pauses to summarize his discussion. He claims that the word "problem" refers to "a serious mathematical challenge" in the sense of Connes’s second level and in particular in the spirit of the second and third levels. Namely, a problem is a mathematical challenge requiring the solver to make use of known skills in a new context and to sometimes rely on unconscious processes in order to make progress. 

Gardiner, further clarifies by asserting that a problem is "much more than just a hard exercise," in that it is not soluble through some algorithmic process. Learning algorithms and standard procedures for solving a problem are certainly necessary for developing technique and this is how many of us learn mathematics. But like the soccer player and the pianist, technique s just the first step. As the soccer player trains in order to compete by completing practice games, and the pianist trains in order to make music by practicing composition, the mathematician must train in order to "make mathematics" by working on challenging problems. 

One interesting point I’ve heard again and again (and which has certainly been reflected in my own scientific work) is that new ideas come from old ideas having sex. Less informally, Gardiner references Koestler’s The Act of Creation (1976) in which he argues that scientific and literary creativity comes from finding and making use of "double meanings with a built-in tension." In Koestler’s own words: 

Aside: I can certainly see this is true in the case of scientific creativity: all new ideas truly do extend from and build upon old ideas. But this doesn’t seem to be true for literary work. For example, Giovanni’s room, The Brother’s K, and The Parable of The Sower could be seen as combinations of disparate situations (living in a foreign country and sexuality; family life and identity; economic destructions and religious movements) but I think this is a surface level reading of what makes them interesting. In each case the authors presented a captivating story and told that story in an effervescent language which gave life and substance to it. This seems different from bissociation.

This double meaning is expressed in Koestler’s own words: "by the perceiving of a situation or idea L in two self-consistent but habitually incompatible frames of reference…the event L is made to vibrate simultaneously on two different wavelengths, as it were."

Gardiner makes an insightful, if understated, reference to the role of faith in mathematical work. He notes that mathematicians know very well that it is irrational to assume that every problem can be solved, but this assumption is an absolutely necessary working hypothesis. Thus the mathematician has to believe that the problems she tries to solve can be solved with the techniques we already know and which we can deploy with ingenuity. This belief in the achievability of a solution in the absence of a rational argument for that feasibility seems to be the essence of faith.

Responding to Permutation Glass Comments

---------------------------------------------------------------------- Report of the First Referee -- EL11492/Williams ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This paper is a continuation of Ref. [5] which introduces a new statistical physics model, motivated by work on protein folding and design, that studies the statistical physics of the permutation group. In [5] the author studied a model in which every permutation that switches elements from the ``ground state'', i.e., a list in the correct order 1, 2, ..., N, costs the same energy for each ``misplaced'' element. In this paper the author studies how the model behaves when the energy cost of switching elements is a random variable chosen from a flat, Gaussian, or symmetric Bernoulli distribution; hence the name ``permutation glass''. In this sense the model might be thought of as falling into a class of models that start not from a physically based Hamiltonian (although a Hamiltonian can be written down), but rather from the properties arising from a given group of transformations.  The author goes on to obtain several results, the first being that the transition temperature in the ``glassy'' version of the model is bounded from above by the transition temperature in the previously studied ``uniform'' model. He then goes on to find bounds on the transition temperature given the three different types of probability distributions considered. Further analysis, such as a study of the order parameter of the model, is done through numerical simulations.  This is an interesting paper and the analysis seems sound, so I have no problem recommending it for publication in PRE. I do have a couple of comments for the author to consider:  1) It seems to me that the model might have more physical (or biological) relevance if it allowed for a ``zero permutational mode''. That is, in a model with four components the ground state would be 1234, but 2341, 3412, and 4123 would all have energy 4\lambda_0 (in the nondisordered case). (I might have misunderstood the setup of the model, and if so will be glad to be corrected by the author, but this is how it looks to me from reading both papers.) It's likely that the behavior of the models would be both richer and have more applications if such zero modes were incorporated. Can the author comment? 
 2) The ``interacting model'' is not considered in this paper, but does receive a very brief mention in the Discussion section. But little is said except that incorporating an interaction term in the Hamiltonian would yield some interesting new and potentially novel results. Can anything more be said? At least some speculations or conjectures?  After the author has considered these comments, I recommend publication in Physical Review E. 
First reviewer:
Thank you for the feedback.

1) The model does seem to allow for a “zero permutational mode” as I think you have described it. Namely, for a four component system, the permutation model does take the state 1234 to be the ground state of the system with energy E=0, and the states 2341, 3412, and 4123 all do have energy 4\lambda_0 (in the non-disordered case). 

But I may be misunderstanding your comment. Are you considering the incorporation of a “zero permutational mode” in which all cyclic permutations of a particular ordering are taken to be represent the same state?

2) Since the non-disordered interacting model (discussed in the previous paper) produced results I did not anticipate, I’m hesitant to say anything explicit about the disordered interacting model since I haven’t studied it in detail. But given the nontrivial results of the non-disordered interacting model and in the disordered non-interacting model, I believe it’s safe to expect that the disordered-interacting model would yield something interesting. 

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Report of the Second Referee -- EL11492/Williams ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The author has done an outstanding job in presenting new and interesting results on a permutation glass. The derivations are complete and the reading is clear and concise. I have no major concerns, but I have one minor concern that the author should either address carefully by modifying one section, or perhaps (if my intuition is incorrect) place a reassuring comment in the writing.  Minor (optional): Eq. 16 shows that the shift in Tc can only be a few percent lower at most before the approximation becomes invalid. Tc(sigma) = Tc(0)*[1 – epsilon] where epsilon << 1. Of course this is the limit where there is a sharp distribution around an energy cost, therefore, the results can be expected to approach the ordered case. My only point here is that this particular limit does not seem useful. If the author can see a use for it, beyond the fact it can be analyzed, it would be good to comment on this, because it escapes me.  Minor:  The section leading up to Eq. 40 (the conjecture): The argument made is that only the total probability for lambda < 0 should matter, and using this perspective, a more universal relation is obtained for tolerance to non-thermal disorder the system can tolerate and still have <j>=0 below a critical temperature. However, it seems to me that if the energy benefit were to be increased using greater |lambda| with lambda < 0, while keeping the probability the same, one would get a different result. A simple case to work out to check this is a non-symmetric Bernoulli distribution, where the negative lambda has a much greater magnitude than the positive magnitude. Intuitively, it seems to me that the ratio of (or more likely, a lever balance of) conditional moments should be relevant, such that the integrand lambda*p(lambda) should be integrated from –infinity to 0 compared to the integrand integrated from 0 to +infinity. If the first conditional moment is M_neg and the second is M_pos then perhaps what is most relevant is the sum: Mpos + Mneg > 0 for an ordered state to exist below some Tc. Since this seems very intuitive, the author should check this, and even if this turns out not the case, a comment about why not, might be beneficial.


Second Reviewer:
Thank you for your feedback. 

Response to Minor (optional): Right. I present the epsilon<<1 limit primarily because it leads to a soluble transition temperature, but also because this limit makes transparent how small amounts of disorder affect the transition temperature. In the appendix, I showed that given a small amount of disorder, one could intuitively derive why the disordered transition temperature is always lower than the non-disordered transition temperature. Thus the epsilon<<1 limit makes possible a calculation which provides the intuition underlying the more general transition temperature calculations.  

Response to Second Minor: Your condition Mpos + Mneg > 0 is consistent with the condition P_(lambda<0) < 1/N.  

The P_(lambda<0) < 1/N inequality is distribution independent, so it is valid even for a very non-symmetric Bernoulli distribution. Your example calculation -- of M_neg = integral(-infty, 0, lambda*p(lambda));  M_pos = integral(0, infty, lambda*p(lambda)); M_neg+M_pos>0 -- is equivalent to requiring that the mean of lambda is greater than zero. In Eq.13 of the paper, I showed that T_c (the temperature below which <j>=0) satisfies the inequality T_c  < (mean of lambda)/ln(N). Thus, as you state, <j>=0 can only exist and T_c can only be physical if the mean of lambda>0. This fact is contained within P_(lambda<0) because the derivation leading to the inequality for T_c and the derivation leading to the inequality for P_(lambda<0) both begin from the same the equilibrium condition Eq.12. Thus the two inequalities are just different presentations of the same underlying result. 

It is good to know that this is not clear in the text, so I will add it.

From Shirley A. Jackson interview in “Technology and The Dream”

"I said that in many ways a lot of women at MIT, white females, were hostile. In the early days, they didn’t want to work with me on problem sets. They would work with each other, not with me. I told you about the first incident when they told me to go away. They might speak to me in the dorm and not speak to me in the halls of MIT. I’d get my tray in the cafeteria. This was when I lived in McCormick Hall. Girls would be sitting at the table, eating their dinner, other women in the dorm. I would go sit at a table that had people at it. And even though they might still have their desserts, or sometimes food on their plates, all of a sudden they’d be done. And after a while I would sit and they would immediately say, “Well, where’s Jenny?” And I would say, “Well I can eat without her.” Or, If I went and sat at a table alone, then I would stay alone, unless Jenny happened to come and decide to sit there. Probably the fact that we tended to be pushed together created some early tension, but I think we grew out of that pretty quickly. People were forever calling her Shirley and calling me Jenny. In fact, one girl’s parents were up visiting once and and I walked by, and she said “Jenny, I want you to meet my parents.” But I wan’t Jenny, that was the only problem.

“Then if I would go to class, I would sit in the middle of the second row because that was the best seat for seeing everything, particularly when the professors would lecture on a raised platform. But then nobody would sit around me. Or, I would do the problem sets and the other students would come in and talk about how they had done the problems, but nobody would talk to me. I would always put a cover sheet on my problem sets. What would happen is that the grade would be written on the cover sheet. So when they saw that I was getting 50 out of 50, 49 out of 50, basically 98%, 100%, 95% — then they would come talk to me, but only about a specific problem that they couldn’t get. They would never generally invite me into their space—only when we were talking about some specific problem.

“So it was never a full-fledged being part of the group. And that was true, by and large, in my class, even though my class had the highest number of women physics majors that MIT had ever had. So, it was very much this limited interaction. If they talked to me at all, it was about a specific thing that I would know, but not part of the general studies. It was difficult to be invited generally into the study groups, so I basically worked alone. I’d say that was definitely true through the bulk of my undergraduate years. Other than the work I did in the metallurgy and materials lab, I pretty much worked on my own…

* Jenny was another black female undergraduate in Shirley Jackson’s class.

Brainstorm Notes for Workshop
- Scientists are trained in a meritocracy
- Meritocracy (Wikipedia definition): philosophy which holds that certain things such as economic goods, or power, should be vested in individuals on the basis of talent. 

True/False
- Talented/Able/good science students and scientists always succeed in science
- Academia has evolved means to accurately evaluate potential, ability
- The way your culture perceives your academic ability does not affect how you perceive your ability
- How you perceive your ability in a certain direction, does not affect whether you actively pursue this direction 

- Scientists are able to objectively evaluate people and ideas
	True/False
	- Scientists think too rigorously to be influenced by personal or ideological biases
	- All good and correct scientific ideas are recognized as such eventually
- There is a clear and unambiguous definition of what constitutes a capable scientist or science student
	- Numerical data constitutes objective fact
	- Intelligence is the predominant criterion in determining success in science
- Demographic distributions in academia reflect demographic distributions in intelligence, potential, and ability.


Framing Questions
-Why are there so many black players in the NBA?
-What is race? 
-What is objectivity?
-What is a meritocracy?


As we are educated in physics, we learn much about the solid facts of physical reality but less about the social contexts which surround the development of these facts but also which define the situations in which we learn them. This is not to say that we gain no knowledge about these social contexts, but rather that this knowledge is implicit, and as such is un-interrogated. As scientists, and as purveyors of humanity’s closest to ideal representations of truth, our objective should be to not only determine what that truth is but to interrogate the process by which we choose those who enter into the profession of defining that truth. 

- What are the goals of this workshop?

Throughout our education in physics (or science in general), we are taught much about the abstract and concrete ideas through which we interpret physical reality, but we are taught much less about the social contexts through which these ideas are developed and about the kinds of people who develop such ideas. This is not to say that we gain no knowledge about these social contexts, but rather that this knowledge is tacitly internalized through interactions with teachers, peers, and the larger scientific community. And since this knowledge is tacit, it is often un-interrogated, which is problematic since it forms the foundation of peer and community relationships that make modern science possible.

And since this knowledge is tacit, it is often un-interrogated, which is problematic since it forms the foundation of peer and community relationships that make modern science possible. 

Therefore, as scientists, and as our culture’s presumed purveyors of humanity’s closest ideals of truth, we should be willing to not only seek out what this truth is, but to also interrogate the process by which we determine this truth and the ways we select (unintentionally or not) those who we choose to make such determinations. 

The goal of this workshop is to make explicit to the participants the assumptions which underlie their work and sense of place in the academic sphere called “science”—assumptions regarding their own rationality, ability, and potential and said qualities relative to the qualities of demographic subsets of people within academia, and also relative to the much larger sets of people not in academia.  By making such assumptions explicit the hope is that, as future teachers, our engagement with students is changed, and we can thus move science closer toward the egalitarian ideal it champions.

future teachers our engagement with students is changed and we can thus move science closer toward the egalitarian ideal it champions. 


Some statements you should recognize are more complicated than they appear:
- Science is a meritocracy
- Scientists are more objective than regular people


Meritocracy Main Exercise
-- Why are there so many black men and women in the NBA and WNBA?
-- Why are there so few of other demographic groups in the NBA?

-- Why are there so many people of European and Asian descent in Academia?
-- Why are there so few of other demographic groups in Academia?


Objectivity Main Exercise
-- Why are scientists so objective and rational?

[Day 1: Concerning Meritocracy]

Let’s start with a riddle: 

A man and his son are driving on the highway. They get into an accident and the man dies. The son is taken to a hospital where the surgeon sees him and says “This is my son!” Who is the surgeon?

(2 minutes to think of an answer)

The standard answer to this riddle is the mother! (There is another answer if you relax the assumption of heteronormativity). The essential point is that if this assumption did not immediately jump out at you, it is likely because of the implicit associations you have about the word “surgeon”. These associations are framed within narratives concerning people their abilities and places in society, and largely the purpose of this workshop is to expose these tacit narratives and thus make them more amenable to interrogation. In the end, with these narratives exposed and questioned, we can begin to see our world differently and thus see the people who occupy our classrooms differently.

(Present Mission Statement)

Let’s expand scope a bit. In this series we are primarily concerned with Science and Society and in the manifold levels between the two. Thus our examples are sometimes drawn from academia writ large or something specific to American culture. If the study we cite concerns something existing in society, but presumably outside of academia, recognize it can still be relevant to academia since academics are inevitably people of society. 

Our first question will be: Does Science have a culture? And if so, what are the foundations or foundational assumptions of that culture?

(Gather Responses)

There are two fundamental qualities that we’d like to zero in on: The culture of meritocracy and the culture of objectivity. We will mostly talk about the culture of meritocracy today. And discuss the culture of objectivity next time. 

So let’s focus on meritocracy: What is a meritocracy? 

Meritocracy is the belief — or a social system founded on that belief — that rulers should be chosen for their abilities rather than for their wealth or family tree. (vocabulary.com)

In meritocracy, advancement is based on achievement or ability rather than social class or parental status. According to the meritocratic model, all individuals have an equal chance to succeed and to develop their abilities for the benefit of themselves and their society. (Shephard, Cenage Advantage Books: Sociology)

(Fun fact: Although, the concept has been around for millennia, the term “meritocracy” was 	coined in the past century in a parody of social systems based on the philosophy. See Michael Young’s The Rise of the Meritocracy )

Essential in these definitions of meritocracy are the concepts of “fairness” and “equitability”. Namely that people have equal opportunities to develop abilities and they are then fairly evaluated on the basis of those abilities for advancement. 

Let’s consider how these definitions apply to Science. Here are some statements underlying meritocratic assumptions of science. As a group discussion consider whether these statements are true or false: 

Scientists are trained in a meritocracy
- Talented science students/scientists (at every level from K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate education) always succeed in science
- Academia has evolved means to accurately evaluate potential and ability
- Your family’s socioeconomic status and educational background does not affect your access to science education or your ability to develop skills
- How you perceive your ability in a certain direction, does not affect whether or how successfully you actively pursue this direction 
-Society’s stereotypes about an individual do not affect that individual’s sense of their abilities. 
- The way your culture perceives the academic ability of your demographic does not affect how authority figures evaluate your individual ability. 

(Group Discussion / Gather Responses)

Key to the sense that a meritocracy exists is that there is a social system which supports individuals expression of their abilities, regardless of their social origins. Some things we accept in a meritocracy and some things we do not are:

Things we might accept in a meritocracy 
	- People have different abilities (e.g., work ethic, talent)
	- People make different choices

Things we would not accept in a meritocracy
	- People’s abilities are not evaluated objectively
	- People have different opportunities which constrain their spectrum of choices

One thing that can affect a meritocracy are perceptions especially when those perceptions are codified into law. 

One thing that can affect a meritocracy are the systems which create pathways for success. Here is an example of a Former Princeton student talking about such pathways and contesting the claim that he is in any way privileged because he is white and male. 

Perhaps my privilege is that those two resilient individuals came to America with no money and no English, obtained citizenship, learned the language and met each other; that my grandfather started a humble wicker basket business with nothing but long hours, an idea, and an iron will—to paraphrase the man I never met: “I escaped Hitler. Some business troubles are going to ruin me?” Maybe my privilege is that they worked hard enough to raise four children, and to send them to Jewish day school and eventually City College.

Perhaps it was my privilege that my own father worked hard enough in City College to earn a spot at a top graduate school, got a good job, and for 25 years got up well before the crack of dawn, sacrificing precious time he wanted to spend with those he valued most—his wife and kids—to earn that living. I can say with certainty there was no legacy involved in any of his accomplishments. The wicker business just isn’t that influential. Now would you say that we’ve been really privileged? That our success has been gift-wrapped? (Citation: http://time.com/85933/why-ill-never-apologize-for-my-white-male-privilege/)

The confusion here is between privilege as a marker of interpersonal relations and privileges as they exist in systems which codify those relations. Before this student’s grandfather had made it, through immense struggle, to America, the country had already codified into a system of housing loans which granted loans to white citizens and denied them to black citizens. In the language of the manual, the raters of a location were to seek to ”protect a neighborhood against adverse influences” among which included “inharmonius racial groups” (Citation: https://epress.trincoll.edu/ontheline2015/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2015/03/1936FHA-Underwriting.pdf).  There were various forces which made such explicit racism possible, one of which was lobbying by white southern senators who did not approve of legislation that helped all people, regardless of race, of a certain socioeconomic background. 

The FHA policy of 1934-1968 which instituted such policies would be an example of an interpersonal prejudice being codified into law and thus becoming a systemic prejudice which can continue to determine life outcomes even in the absence of interpersonal prejudice. 

At this point it would be good to distinguish between prejudice as it arises in systems and prejudice which is interpersonal. As teachers you should be cognizant of both forms, because both forms affect who enters your classroom and also how they feel about being there. 

Systematic prejudice is one major way that inequality 

(Abby’s discussion of race, racism, sex, and sexism)

In the initial part of our discussion, we have found that key to the sense that meritocracy exists is that there is equality of opportunity and objectivity in measurements of ability. We have argued there is not equality of opportunity. Now let’s investigate whether there is objectivity in evaluation.


[Day 2: Concerning Objectivity]

Last time we began with a discussion of meritocracy. Let’s now move on to discuss objectivity. What are some possible definitions of objectivity. 

(Gather Responses)

A definition taken from online

objectivity is judgment based on observable phenomena and uninfluenced by emotions or personal prejudices
(vocabulary.com)

Scientists are presumably objective not only in their practice of science but also in their engagement with people. In a group consider the list of statements which explore this idea. 

- Scientists are able to objectively evaluate people and ideas
	True/False
	- Scientists think too rigorously to be influenced by personal or ideological prejudices
	- All good and correct scientific ideas are recognized as such eventually
- There is a clear and unambiguous definition of what constitutes a capable scientist or science student
	- Numerical data constitutes objective and unambiguous fact
	- Intelligence is the predominant criterion in determining success in science
	- There exist ways to accurately and reliably measure intelligence, potential, ability, etc. 
- Demographic distributions in academia reflect demographic distributions in intelligence, potential, and ability.

(Group Discussion and Gather Responses)j

What factors may make these statements untrue. 

Objective metrics: IQ, Race, and Gender

An often unstated assumption underlying our work as scientists is that intelligence (variously defined) determines the success of a science student. And as scientists, we often believe in the importance of metrics and numbers, leading us to believe that IQ scores (or their proxies like SAT or GRE scores) tell us something significant about an individual. But while numbers do not lie, they can often mislead. 

There are a few problems with attributing “success differences” across populations to demographics.  Here are a few reasons. 

This is a fairly common topic in CMV. I'm guessing you haven't done a search for this? Most of these points have been addressed in other threads. Give me a moment and I'll look for some comments I've made in the past about this and edit this comment.
EDIT: I noticed you mentioned a few other things that I will need to address. EDIT2: You haven't provided the sources for your studies. I have seen adoption studies that have shown equal IQs between the races. I typically don't ask for sources, but because you are making scientific claims I am going to have to ask that you link them.
Simply put, if you take the IQ scores of blacks and whites, blacks score lower than whites by about 15 points.
This statistic of course, doesn't take into account anything other than race. Let's go through why most of the academic community isn't concerned about this.
1) The gap we see here is not at all unique. There have been many instances of populations of people with lower than average IQ that have closed the gap entirely.
For example, women used to score far lower than men on IQ tests. This is no longer the case since women have gotten more educated. In this case, we are starting to see the IQs of women surpass those of men (in general)].
Another example is the IQ data gathered from East and West Germany prior to unification. East and West Germans were / are genetically indistinguishable, but there was a gap between the two reaching 17 points in some areas. If you take IQ as being mostly genetic, these results are highly problematic.
A third example (and I could go on for longer but this is already long enough) is the Flynn effect. This is the well documented phenomenon that observes populations IQs rising as they develop economically. The average black person today gets the same score as the average white person did in the US in the year 1950. The average black person's score is 15 points higher than the average white person just 100 short years ago. Unless you think there was a major genetic change in whites in the past 50-100 years, the rise in scores (for both races) was due to environmental changes. Whites have simply enjoyed a higher standard of living (then and now) which leads to them having environments more conducive to learning.
I know I said that was the last example I'd give, but let me do one more because I think it illustrates my point. Another big difference in IQ scores can be seen between northern Americans and Americans in the South. In fact, there have been studies done where blacks in the north scored higher on IQ tests than whites in the south. Are northerners different genetically than southerners? If not, then why the difference? If we accept whatever that difference is, why are you not using that to explain the black - white difference?
The above examples give pause to the idea that IQs for groups are set in stone (they 100% are not and that's a fact), and that genetics are the primary determination of a persons cognitive ability.
2) IQ scores only measure one type of intelligence (poorly)
IQ scores can only measure one type of intelligence, and it doesn't even do that as well as we'd like. IQ tests don't accurately measure strategic intelligence, or even creative intelligence.
This is a huge problem since these forms of intelligence that the IQ tests cannot measure are some of the most important. Creativity lies at the soul of every major invention. It lies in the soul of every song, movie or play. Similar things can be said of strategic thinking.
Would we think worse of people like Jimi Hendrix and Ghengis Khan if we found out they scored low on an IQ test. If we would, we probably shouldn't.
3) IQ scores cannot measure potential
There are certain types of questions asked on IQ tests that you can get better at with practice. For example, pattern recognition and memorization are two things you can improve on drastically throughout your life (if you practice). This has two problems. One, it gives advantages to people who do similar kinds of thinking activities daily (this explains some of the Flynn effect we discussed earlier). Two, we may mistake someone had a low genetic limit based on someone not normally having to perform those kinds of activities, or not having as good of tools throughout their lives. Here is someone discussing this here.
4) At this point people will often say that when you control for certain variables the differences don't entirely disappear. For one, the differences fall away quite rapidly once you start controlling for things (income and neighborhoods mostly). Second, we have no way of controlling for other things that effect IQ testing scores.
One such example is Stereotype Threat. This is a phenomena that we've seen in not only IQ scores, but in math, reading, sports and (essentially) any other area where a stereotype exists. Stereotype threat is the phenomena that shows people perform worse if there is a fear that they will further a certain stereotype about themselves. The presence of this cannot be totally corrected for (although it can be manipulated somewhat).
Another example is cultural differences. We know that there are many ways that different races raise their children that influence their cognitive development. I really want to wrap this up, but one such example is the word gap.


Also, successful researchers do not entirely believe that IQ is the most  salient factor in defining their success. 

[Quote from Laurent Schwartz]

[Quote from Grothendieck]

[Quote from Math so and sos]


There are problems with these definitions however. Sex is often conflated with gender, and race seems to be a social phenomena. And when you consider ethnic groups it is difficult to reconcile the fact that those of sub saharan African descent have low its with the fact that African immigrants are some of the most highly educated immigrants in America. (citation)

Men and Women IQ differences. 
Racial IQ differences. 

Demore conflates sex and gender. There has been much written in critique of the Bell Curve. 

The metrics that we use to measure ability are not objective and do not bear the objective features we claim they do. But let’s assume this were not the case. Let’s assume still that people can reason objectively. 

Let’s assume these were not relevant, and people simply had to evaluate candidates on the basis of their objective ability. What would they find? 

There have been a few studies in this direction.

Over the course of two days we have explored the idea of meritocracy, the concept of systems of prejudices and notions of objectivity. Now, how do these ideas relate to how we deal with students in our classes? 

Action Items


—————
Supplement —Just Asking Questions: Preserving the meritocracy:

In his defense of publishing a discussion of The Bell Curve, Andre Sullivan explained that he is willing to entertain all controversial perspectives. 

Airing taboo stuff and examining and critiquing it has been a running feature of this blog from its beginnings. It is an axiom of mine that anything can be examined and debated – and that the role of journalism is not to police the culture but to engage in it forthrightly and honestly. (Citation: http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2014/12/22/excuse-me-mr-coates/)

Similarly James Demore explained that there needed to be an open dialogue concerning how sex differences affect competencies and work outcomes. 

I value diversity and inclusion, am not denying that sexism exists, and don’t endorse using stereotypes. When addressing the gap in representation in the population, we need to look at population level differences in distributions. If we can't have an honest discussion about this, then we can never truly solve the problem. (Citation: )

These are both reasonable beliefs, but it itself requires some forthright and honest engagement. When people study whether IQ affects life outcomes, underlying the question is often an attempt see whether the correlation between demographics and social status can be explained without reference to social structure. This question takes it as a possibility that existing social structures are just and people’s perceived inadequacies are due to factors outside of unequal distribution of resources, acculturation, or systematic impediments. This, of course, is a fair possibility to entertain, but in the space of other possibilities and question framings it is a unique possibility that is explored with an intent to create ambiguities which justify existing socioeconomic inequalities rather than rectify them. 

In a way, the question is a leading one, hiding behind a frame of objectivity, but in fact presuming the relevance and truth of a conclusion the asker is apparently (but not really) calling into the question. A lawyer asks “So when did you decide to kill the sheriff?” and he knows that even if the answer is an unequivocal denial, the posing of the question has already established some presumption of guilt. 

This is to say the questions we ask, the questions we think are even worth asking, not only constrain the answers we find but also reflect our intentions concerning the utility of those answers.  That is we ask a question not only in some abstract desire to augment our knowledge but to do something with the answers we find, and hidden behind that intent is a framing of the world which constrains our ability to see what other questions underlie, contextualize, and perhaps obviate our initial one. 

There are other questions we can ask about IQ scores which exist outside the frame of preserving the sense that our nation is a meritocracy. Here are some of them: 

What is the correlation between IQ test scores and the prevalence of test taking in the history of the associated culture?

How do you give an IQ test to someone who is illiterate? How could such an IQ score be compared to the scores of literate individuals? 

What is the minimum IQ score necessary to make a creative contribution to an artistic or scientific field? 

If IQ scores should be stable over a person’s life, and are good measures of the general intelligence of the human race, why do they increase on average every 15 years?

One could perhaps sense the intent of these questions is to interrogate the validity of IQ scores themselves. This is fine. The intent is obvious here to provide the example that few questions about social structure are pursued innocuously. The more fundamental point is that underlying most questions is an intent which exists apart from an attempt to get at the “truth” of our world. 

Can’t this conclusion be applied to this discussion? Absolutely. It would be not merely inconsistent, but also disingenuous for us to claim otherwise.

Supplement: The Feasibility of Meritocracy
We have argued that meritocracy does not exist in America. The question is whether it is possible: Longoria argues that it is not:

As long as the family and class background have an influence on a person’s outcome, the distribution of social goods are not distributed entirely on merit. It its ideal, it is only after these factors are eliminated that the distribution of goods and positions can be based on merit. In short the correlation between one’s social origins and one’s outcome in life is zero in a meritocracy. (Richard Longoria)

So in a purely “meritocratic system” parents would not be able to bestow upon their children advantages which are not available to other children. Parents wouldn’t be able to pay to send their children to private school, pay for private tutors or standardized test courses. Parents would not be allowed to give students an inheritance or really any resource not available to all other children. (The Meritocracy Myth, pg. 238)

This is not (and should not necessarily be) possible in society as we have constructed. Thus, from birth origin alone, it appears that there will always be inequalities in opportunity which can later on manifest in difference in ability. What this means for your role as citizens of this country is up to you. What this means for your work as teachers is that student potential is not always reflected in success according to metrics which measure ability accumulated from cultural capital. Recognizing this can help you better evaluate your students. 

———————

Unless you assume that the lower social classes have a monopoly on lower ability, in a true meritocracy the correlation between the social status you’re born into and your adult social status would be zero.

What enters into the formation of ability? What determines the validity of evaluation? 




(The reason why we Academia does not bear these features is because it seems to have things we do not accept in a meritocracy)

Americans like to believe we live in a meritocratic society, and thus in the presence of clear educational and economic inequalities there have been many attempts to preserve the sense of a meritocracy. The intent is to minimize the influence of social status and wealth, and maximize the influence of ability (variously defined). But because ability must be measured, these two factors 


How deeply does it go? Are pure meritocracies possible?

Short Blurb for Permutation Glass

A Disordered System in the Space of Permutations

The work considers a new model of glassy systems in which a thermal system is subjected to the random energies of various orderings of a list. 

This work considers a disordered system in the class of spin glasses where, rather than the state space being the space of various possible spins, the state space consists of the various possible orderings of a list. 


 rather than the space of various possible spins, a space of various spins, or positions in a lattice, the system explores a space of various orderings of a list. 

 abstracted

This work considers a disordered system in the class of spin glasses where, rather than the state space being the space of various possible spins, the state space consists of the various possible orderings of a list.

Although materials scientists make extensive use of various kinds of glass, physicists do not understand glasses as well as they understand other systems like ideal gases or liquids. To build understanding of such glasses physicists construct models which bear some of the basic properties of glasses (like disorder) without some of the properties which make them difficult to analyze. In this category are spin glasses which consist of taking the interactions between spins on a lattice to be random. In this paper, the authors consider permutation glasses which are more abstract models of disorder consisting of a state space of permutations where the energies of each permutation are random much in the same way spin glass interaction energies are random. The main result of the model shows that this energy disorder can contribute to thermal disorder, thus making the system less tolerant of high temperatures. The results of this model expand our understanding of how disorder affects to systems with many degrees of freedom and also how such disorder can be manifest in abstract physical systems.

Notes from Group Meeting
-Michael’s suggestion: Your consideration of offset energy and protein dimerization is similar to the results of Stability and Protein Dimer constraints in Eugene’s 2008 Molecular Systems Paper
-Eugene (professor): In Sanchari’s paper, the number of a single type of DHFR was increased not really the total number of monomers in the system. It would be most relevant if you could write each monomer as existing distinctly from every other monomer so you could tune their abundances individually. 
-Eugene (professor): Combinatorial factor in front of partition function doesn’t change  really the energetics of the system. Simpl
-Eugene (post-doc): The binding energies of the dimers could be temperature dependent due to hydrophobic interactions. The hydrophobic interaction could be temperature dependent
-Michaels Suggestion: You only wrote down the conditions for critical points. You also need to check stability conditions on Laplace’s method
-Rostam’s claim: Estimate of the melting temperature is not exactly correct because you 
-Proteins in a Cell: Stupid calculation should not be mentioned: There are many types of proteins in the cell and all of the other reasons you mentioned. 


-Self assembly is the most relevant physical system for this analysis because you have a single copy of each subunit. 

Tips for permutation Glass Paper
don’t include the word "new" in the abstract. It should be understood that the work is "new". 
Use "paper" instead of "work"
Don’t italicize ansatz
Section labels should be shortened to be "Sec."

Notes from Jean Luc Dumont’s Clear, Accurate, Concise Writing Lecture

The goal of structure in a paper is to allow easy access to the content of the paper. To make the content easily accessible requires paying attention to three things. 
- Paragraphs that convey a message. 
- Sentences that express ideas
- Word choice allowing you to say more with less

For scientific writing, it is not always true that you should always write in passive voice or always write in active voice. Your choice between active or passive voice should follow from the main subject of the paragraph. 

Effective communication entails conveying a message. The message consists of interpreting the information of a study. The information is the "what" of the study, and the message is the "so what." Often, the "so what" constitutes a full declarative sentence. 

The "so what" is not only necessary in text. It should also be included in figure captions and titles. For example, having a picture of a mouse, and then stating "this is a figure of a mouse" would be an ineffective caption. A more effective one would be something like "furry four legged animals with long noses and a tail are often naively categorized as mice, but they are more generally considered to be part of the rodent family." 

A paragraph referring to the title of the section or to previous paragraphs are weak paragraphs because they are either redundant or they confuse the reader, who is likely reading them out of order. 

For a paragraph, you state the main message and then you develop in in the sentences below. This structure matches that found in slides. 

Consequently, when outlining a scientific paper, you should write out the topic sentences first rather than writing out entire paragraphs in sequence. 

(For Presentations) When giving a presentation, especially a long one, it is useful to include roadmaps at the beginning. These roadmaps tell the audience how much content they will be expected to pay attention to, and, if you refer to the roadmaps, throughout the audience is better aware of where they are in your presentation. Telegraphing where you’re going before you go there also makes papers easier to read. 

(For Presentations) Paragraphs in presentations should be read out loud, or you should stop speaking momentarily to allow the audience to read them. If you do not read them yourself or stop speaking, then the audience has to choose whether to listen to you or read your passage. 

One way to get a sense of whether your prose is convoluted or difficult to read, is to read it out loud. If you get lost in the train of thought underlying your sentences then likely these sentences would be hard to read on paper. 

The readability of a text is not about length but about sentence structure. Your sentences should be structured the way you structure your ideas. 
- One idea should be associated with one sentence. If the idea is complex, then the associated sentence will also be complex (i.e., it will contain many organized levels of sub-ideas)
- The subject of the idea should be the subject of the sentence in order to suggest that the idea is the most important thing in the sentence. 
- The main idea should be in the main clause of a sentence, while the subordinate idea is relegated to a subordinate clause. 

Eliminate or replace filler phrases that sound professional and formal but which actually add little to the text. For example, don’t write phrases like "We should note that…",  "From all these results it is possible to conclude that…", "It is exceedingly clear that…" because they use more words than necessary. In the first case you can eliminate the phrase entirely, and in the second and third cases, respectively, you can write "In conclusion,…" and "Clearly,…"

What the audience wants from content depends on who they are. Specialists want more details and are OK with technical terms. Non-specialists want more background and interpretation and need non-technical terms or technical terms that are defined. 

When using technical terms the purpose is to be precise and concise at the same time. This level of precision and concision is the opposite of how many politicians speak; politicians often try to say as little as possible in as many words as possible to protect themselves from blowback. 

Do not use jargon. Jargon consists of undefined technical terms or acronyms that the writer knows the audience does not understand. Jargon creates distance between the writer and the reader and also between the reader and the message. 

Clear writing (as opposed to writing which uses jargon) is immediate and unambiguous, that is it quickly get’s to the message and does so with out confusing elements. 

Accurate writing conveys the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. 
- Accurate writing also avoid using the words "this" or "that" by themselves. Either replace each one with a more specific noun or follow each one with a specific noun. 

When writing introductions, make the sections the subject of the work rather than the authors. For example, "Sec. II shows…" rather than "In Sec. II we show"

Concise writing is clear, accurate, and uses as few words as possible. 


January 18, 2018 — Thursday 1:44 PM
Dreams of Jiwon
Last night I dreamt of Jiwon. Before you get ahead of yourself, the dream was not like that. For some reason, Jiwon and I were sitting on a floor in a building with a small white child between the ages of six and ten. I do not know the connection the small child had to either of us, but for some reason he was with us. The child was talkative, energetic, full of a rambunctious spirit I don’t think I ever had as a child. But he did not know where the line was. What started everything was that he punched Jiwon in the throat. He did so playfully, but it was hard enough to concern me. Or rather enrage me. I asked him why he did it, and he could not come up with what I saw as a good reason. At one point Jiwon tried to push me away, telling me that I was being too hard on the child, but I disagreed. I sat between the child and Jiwon and asked him again what he thought he was doing, what he thought it meant. His answer was still unconvincing. At this point I decided that we were leaving. Apparently we had all come to this nameless place to do something and because of what this child had done, I decided we would not do it anymore. The child cried and protested, but I was adamant. I got up and the child and Jiwon got up as well. 

The next thing I remember is all of us outside in a dark and wet city scape. We were walking to start, but after some point that I cannot identify Jiwon had begun to jog lightly. When I caught up with her I asked her what was wrong. I had thought she was angry at the way I treated the child, but this wasn’t it. She said she thought someone had stolen her wallet and that said person was following her. I was confused by this but she did not further explain. She turned away and kept running to some destination I did not know. 

We eventually arrived at a subway station, and I at last realized that she was right: We were being followed. I decided to confront the person who was following us. We descended the subway stairs (a not terribly smart move in retrospect) and as the two of them stood on the middle platform I walked up the stairs to meet head on the perpetrator. But voices were coming from both sets of stairs leading down to the platform, many voice, too many voices. I realized I was outnumbered and only in some fantasy could I physically defeat whoever was coming to meet us. 

The people who showed up surprised me as well. They were all black women in their late tweens and early twenties wearing undershirts, basketball jersies, or stay at home clothes. And they all carried weapons: a baseball bat, some chains, and a screw driver. They explained what we had done wrong. "We don’t like what you did," they told us. Apparently, earlier in the night, we had purchased something from the wrong store in some invisible division of the city and had thus violated an unstated norm. Now we were to be punished. 

I tried to prevent this. After providing the proper segue, I told them that I came to this city after working many hours and many days as a Ph.D student. I also told them that I worked so hard because I was a black student, and as they surely knew when one was black in this world one had to work so much harder than otherwise. "I’m sure ladies such as yourself recognize what I’m talking about," I said. This transparent ploy of racial solidarity seemed to have appeased them. They commiserated with my situation and decided to let us off with a warning. Then I woke up. 

It is strange that the event which precipitated the events of this dream were similar to how my father often saw my own childhood behaviors. My father was constantly telling me that I did not understand the line between play and something more violent and was always crossing that invisible bounday with my sister. I think of myself as a well behaved kid, but to be honest I’m not sure if my father thought I was so convivial. 

And the "unstated" line that I crossed? Is it a coincidence that in the dream I was with a Korean woman and a white child and faced with potential black women attackers? The symbolism seems so transparent as to make the dream appear fabricated, but then maybe I am not interpreting the events appropriately. Perhaps there are layers of meaning I cannot intuit because my insecurities have made me default to the easiest and seemingly most dangerous explanation.

Lessons on Self-Assembly of Dimer System Project

I have not completed the project yet but I can still write down two lessons I have learned. 

Reconnaissance Questions and Describing the Territory
The first lessons concerns a different way to think of completing investigations or solving problems in mathematics and physics. The standard depiction is that you have a question which is as precisely stated and demarcated as possible and you then go finding a solution within the constraints dictated by the problem. In this depiction of an investigation, the only new thing you learn from the solving the problem is, besides the answer or solution itself, an algorithmic or heuristic approach to solving similar questions. Largely, by the end of the investigation, your sense of what the important question is and thus what indeed represents a solution has not really changed. 

But what I have found in this work is that many of the interesting answers emerged from posing and then exploring sort of reconnaissance questions. These reconnaissance questions were open-ended because I was not entirely sure what I would or whether what I would find would exhibit any consistency worth mentioning. To be specific, for the self-assembly of dimer systems paper, I eventually sought to describe the spectrum of possible <k> and <m> versus temperature plots. I was not sure what kind of plots I would see, but I hoped that they could be categorized in such a way to suggest a theoretical explanation. After some work I realized there were two kinds of plot and four phases between them. I went through about three iterations of naming these phases and characterizing the thermal behavior of each one before I settled on categories and descriptions which seemed accurate. 

I had expected to see phase behavior, but I did not know what phase behavior I would see and so I had to do a bit of exploring before I could adequately describe the plots I was seeing. I think this kind of work is foreign to physicists who often feel they are working within fixed constraints. These constraints are such that what the physicist seeks and the properties it must have are clear and the physicist need only apply proper heuristics to find this hidden thing. Here I did something different, something more akin to a naturalist exploring a mountainside: I began my search not entirely sure of what I would find, not entirely sure if I would find anything, and this led to an open mind which allowed me to see and more accurately describe what I eventually observed. 

The lesson is that questions that lead to this kind of exploring are good questions even if they seem so open-ended as to feel unsafe. These good questions are those that lead you to characterize, name, label, or more generally just identify and describe properties of a new system. 

Takeaway: Even for concrete investigations, it is good to formulate open ended questions which would lead you to characterize various classes of system relevant to your investigation. Questions like
— What are the possible properties of solutions to this system?
— Can solutions be organized into various phases? 
— What would be a good name for the properties I’m observing?


Introductions for Investigations that are Concerned with Modeling
The second lesson concerns introductions, and I learned it—or was placed on the path towards learning it—by developing my group meeting presentation for the dimer system work. I was able to create slides to describe the "meat" of the work quite easily, but I found myself stuck when it came to building an introduction. Previously, I thought the system I was analyzing was quite general, and thus that it would be trivial to write an introduction identifying some specific biological system and citing a poorly-thought out reason for why this system should be studied more carefully. This assumption turned out to be quite far from the truth. Instead it took me almost 24 hours to work through, clarify, and ultimately abandon the assumptions I made about what biological system to which the postulated physical system was related. 

I’m not sure if there is a generalizable lesson here. Be careful about how you frame your introductions? Don’t underestimate crafting a sensible introduction? I’m writing this entry because I was so surprised by how difficult creating this particular introduction was. For my previous two papers, the introductions were more manageable because they were motivated either by the abstracted features of a computational problem or a mathematical question. But here I was trying to motivate the analysis with a specific biological system, and the many different systems I could choose from made the choice of a specific one rather difficult. 

Takeaway: Investigations which are motivated by a biological system may be difficult to write because it is not always clear that the properties inherent in the biological system are well reflected in the model. Thus, it may be necessary to write a somewhat artificial or poorly motivated introduction. 

This is problematic because introductions inevitably frame the way one interprets the subsequent investigation.

Lessons from Writing

Jigsaw-puzzle method of writing does not work
This week, I completed and submitted a version of the "One-body problem." Writing this story was more difficult than I anticipated it would be. My assumption was that since I had already collected many well written paragraphs and sentences, I only needed to assemble these pieces in the correct order to craft the necessary story. The problem was these individual paragraphs were written in disparate contexts and therefore did not seem to naturally flow together. At some point it felt like I was trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle with various pieces from different puzzles, or that I was crating a story which was the written equivalent of Frankenstein’s monster. Eventually, I had to abandon the idea that the story could be assembled from individual pieces and I instead had to try to write the story more organically, beginning with the first sentence and continuing on until I reached the first sensible resting point.

I think I took the initial approach I did partly due to how I write my physics papers. When writing a physics paper, I usually have a list of problems I need to solve, and I then solve them more or less independently of one another. Still all of these problems extend from a general set of questions I’m exploring and therefore they are all related. So when I compose the paper I can bring these problem-solutions together with the knowledge that their solutions are part of a coherent whole and that the logic of their connections could be made clear through some carefully chosen paragraph transitions. Largely, how well I write these transitions is beside the point because the meat of the "story" is contained within the distinct problem-solutions themselves which I know are solid. 

However, when one is writing, the "connections" are largely the brunt of the story itself. There is no clear division between a "problem-solution" and the thing which connects one problem-solution to another. It is all part of the larger story. All of these parts of a story conflate with one another, and I find that in order to effectively articulate one, I must effectively articulate all the others. 

The takeaway here is that you cannot write individual paragraphs and then put them together as if you were putting together a puzzle. The writing should (as much as possible) build organically from one sentence to the next. 

Let your audience be a sympathetic listener (maybe even a future version of yourself)
Another reason I found this writing so difficult is that I had an unreasonable standard for writing down a sentence. In my mind I had made it clear that I wanted to submit whatever I wrote to the Dudley Review, and as a result I prematurely evaluated my sentences according a standard which should only be relevant after many drafts. Usually when I am writing in this document, I write freely with the implicit sense that I am talking to a future version of myself. Consequently, the writing is clear and easy in a way that most of my writing for my MIT assignments was not. 

This difference in difficulty suggests to me that one’s sense of audience is incredibly important at every stage of writing. Picturing my audience as the editors of the Dudley Review I was paralyzed into writer’s block, but when I instead worked to visualize my standard audience (i.e., a future version of myself) my writing became easier. One could question whether this particular audience is a good one, but I think in general any conceptualization of an audience which allows you to write anything is (as a first step) a good one. 

Takeaway: When writing an essay, in order to get words on the page you need to visualize a sympathetic audience. Your default audience of a future version of yourself is good in this regard. 


Immersion allows the subconscious to resolve writing problems
This last lesson concerns something I learned about a year ago. 

When I was writing this story, my plan was to juggle this writing with work on my group meeting presentation. But I soon realized this was not possible. My plans for writing were difficult to enact, and so I found myself with a lot of down-time, not writing but immersed in thought about writing. When I discovered my jig-saw approach to the story would not work, I had to think more carefully about how to write the story better and also about what exact story I wanted to write. In the middle of the process, I had  three partially written story introductions and I was not sure which ones to pursue. 

The process of resolving these confusions looked like this. I would write a bit. I would get stuck. I would take a nap. I would write some more. Often times I watched Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, the type of distraction I previously advised against, but engaging (if only momentarily) in another universe helped to release some of the pressure in being unable to create one on my own. 

Ultimately, though, it because this writing was my only project that allowed me to complete it at all. I did not finish the two stories I wanted to finish, but I did manage to finish one. 

Takeaway: Writing projects require full and unilateral focus on the world the writing is attempting to describe. Immersion is necessary because much of your "writing problem-solving" occurs at a sub-conscious level in the time between bouts of writing. 

What does this immersion look like in practice? It means minimal investment in other world (i.e., minimal reading of new, minimal TV watching, minimal novel reading, etc.) I have conveniently not defined "minimal." In reality it would be preferred if "minimal" was replaced with "zero," but I’m not sure whether this type of exclusion is good for sanity.

Quotes from Math Girls Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems

On intuition clouding reasoning

"Because thinking clouds reason," Miruka said. "A proof performed in the absence of thought, one that utilizes only the form of previous definitions, has a better basis of rationale."
— pg 129

On reaching the boundary of existing knowledge

"When you think you’ve found an error, it’s no mistake to consider your current actions a failure and retreat. But what makes Dedekin a genius is that he turned failure into discovery. He took what looked to be a mistake, what looked like nonsense, and transformed it into something amazing. Sure, sometimes pulling back is the proper strategy. But keep in mind that what you’ve run into may actually be the boundary between what is currently known and a whole new concept, a boundary that’s begging to be broken through.

"When they say there’s no number you can add to 1 to get 0, tell them there is, and call it -1. 

"When they say there’s no number whose square is -1, tell them there is, and you call it i. 

"When they say you can’t create a bijection between a set and one of its subsets, tell them you can and call it the definition of an infinite set. 

"Extending existing concepts never comes easy. Genius lies in realizing that that difficulty is the necessary pause before you can leap into flight."

Notes on "Research mathematicians’ practices in selecting mathematical problems" by Morten Misfeldt and Mikkel Willum Johansen

This paper investigates the ways mathematicians solve and create problems in their research work. The authors aim to use the results of interviews to inform educational practices. They believe education can do more work to investigate how
— students select and develop problems
— work with multiple problems over a long period of time
— use solutions to support the development of new problems
The use of "more" seems like an understatement because it does not seem that current mathematics education really does any of these things. Students do not select their own problems; they work on multiple problems only over a short period of time (~1 week); and students solutions do not lead to the creation of any new problems. But I digress. 


State of the art

In an early section on the "state of the art" with regard to problem formulation and selection, the authors cite Brown and Walter’s The Art of Problem Posing (2005). In that work, Brown and Walter started with the observation that in educational settings, students are assigned problems by authority figures. Brown and Walter sought to expand on this original model and argued that students should work together and individually in both creating and solving problems. 

One approach to problem formulation that Brown and Walter propose is the "what if not" strategy. For this strategy, various aspects of a mathematical context are challenged and ignored, thus generating many new mathematical situations. This approach, however, is limited by the fact that it is not always clear whether the generated questions are worth answering or are too difficult to answer. The issue of determining which problems a mathematician should solve is the primary concern of this paper. 

Given the relevance of problem posing (and problem selection), Brown (in 1984) had previously argued that mathematics is more than a collection of algorithms for solving existent problems. Instead, he thought of mathematics as various ways to make meaning (through definitions and logic) of situations. Namely, mathematics does not merely consist of solving problems or proving theorems, but of generating meaning, although it is not clear what exactly "meaning" entails. 

The authors do not pursue a discussion of meaning. They also do not precisely consider how problem contexts are generated by mathematicians. Instead they focus on the process of problem selection: "the considerations and criteria for choosing directions for research rather than to the skill of stating a problem in a mathematical fashion." It is not clear to me that these two (creation and selection) can be completely divorced since how one frames a problem would surely affect how various criteria are applied to determine its selection. Still, for specificity (and perhaps as an outgrowth from the interviews) the authors focus on selection. 

Finally, the authors mention Burton’s 2004 book "Mathematics as Enquirers." In the book, Burton discusses the ways emotions affect mathematicians intuitions and decisions in problem solving. Thus, the authors infer that mathematics is not purely a rational exercise and emotions play a role in problem choice. 

Investigating Mathematicians Problem Choice

By interviewing mathematicians, the authors sought to determine how they solve problems and generally engaged in research. The mathematicians in the sample were between 30 and 60, all tenured, and all pure mathematicians. The authors justify their age and tenure filters by saying they wanted mathematicians who were mature in their careers and had experience with various mathematical work. They do not justify their exclusion of applied mathematicians. Also, it seems that all of the mathematicians are male. 

The initial interview guid was built from three main areas of concern
— How does a mathematician come to work on a new problem?
— What artifacts support this work and how?
— What is the relation between the investigated aspects of mathematical activity and the writing process?

After subsequent, interviews the authors found that it was better to start by asking "How do you find a suitable mathematical problem to work on". 

Choosing Problems is Important

The interviewer started by telling the mathematicians to describe how they start working on a mathematical problem. In this initial question, the interviewer seemed to be reflecting the belief that all mathematical problems appear precise and evident before they are solved, and thus the only diversity existing in these problems is in how one approaches solving them. However, when the interview asked this question, the interviewees changed the subject to problem selection: 

Interviewee2: Well, in fact I believe it all starts a bit earlier, because you also need to find the problem you wish to attack. There are so many problems, so you have to make some kind of selection. 

Another interviewer noted the difficulty in this problem selection: 

Interviewee12: It is not easy. The great art in mathematics is to find a problem that you have ideas about how to solve. 

Interviewer: Yes?

Interviewee12: And in fact have a chance of solving. [..] The greatest art is not to solve problems. The greatest art is to find the problems we can solve. 

Here "art" perhaps refers to the creative and aesthetic aspects of mathematics, echoing the same kind of "art" discussed in The Art of Problem Posing. 

Some of the interviewees mentioned having a mathematical problem for many years before solving it. The authors cite two reasons for this long period. One, it is often difficult to find the correct framing or idea that makes solving a problem simple. Second, sometimes problems develop and change over time as part of the problem-solving process. 

Interviewee1: Often the problem is not a given. It will develop along the way as you develop new methods, develop new angles of attack and get new questions that might shed new light on old problems. 

This sentiment seems to match what I hope to discuss in "The False Dichotomy Between Problems and Solutions." 

Another mathematician had long-term relationships with mathematical problems because rather than having the goal of solving the problem, he saw the problem as a motivation for new techniques which were his true goal, a sort of desire for the "means" justifying the pursuit of the "ends." The authors have a nice summary of this mathematicians attitude toward problem solving: 

His task as a mathematician  involves more than just solving problems; it also involves working with problems, developing mathematical methods to address them, and representing or refinding the problems in different contexts. In that sense, the mathematicians’ working process not only involves problem solving but also working with problems. 

This "working with" problems is different from just problem posing and problem solving because "working with" suggests a sort of dispassionate exploration of problems as a means to develop understanding. This perspective on mathematical problem solving is akin to Lakatos’s notion of the role logic plays in mathematics (see "Proofs and Refutations" by Lakatos)

Criteria for choosing mathematical problems

Personal motivation and interest

From the collected interviews, the authors found that mathematicians were rarely motivated by "pure interest" in selecting research problems. Instead they were influenced by what problems they thought they could solve and what they thought their colleagues would be interested in. Interviewee3, said "It has mainly to do with what I personally find interesting. When that is said, it has also to do with what other people find interesting." 

Basing problem choice partly on "what others find interesting" seems problematic to me. If the criteria for choosing a problem are grounded in community norms, norms that each individual researcher does not really accept but believes every other researcher accepts, then I think it’s possible to run into an "emperor has no clothes" phenomenon. That is, the community could evolve to a point where each individual researcher is pursuing a research direction, not because he or she finds it intrinsically interesting but because the researcher thinks others will. In this way you could have many researchers in a sub-field who do not even believe—or more practically, agree—with the basic tenets of the field. If the field is popular many people will publish in it initially to take advantage of the high citation accounts, but with a relative dearth of true adherents who question the premises of the sub-field and who thus push it forward, it will eventually stagnate and the boom cycle will be followed by a bust. The only examples of this that come to mind are Geoffrey Chews S-Matrix formalism and String Theory in the late 90s, but my guess is that this happens more often than it is pointed out. Such a feature lends much evidence to the idea that the practice of research cannot be divorced from the social forces which moderate the behavior of its practitioners. 

Problems of the right difficulty

With regard to problem selection, one mathematician referred to a sort of "Goldilocks" space of good problems. Inteviewee3 states that although there are many mathematical problems, most of them are so difficult that they are virtually impossible to solve. Another group is soluble, but is also largely uninteresting. In between, are a "tiny slice" of problems which are both interesting and soluble, and problem selection is all about finding the border of that slice. 

In finding this border, another mathematician contradicted the fable that mathematicians do not get better with age by asserting that he during his career he has improved in problem selection. 

Interviewee5: …Today I am much faster at determining whether I can do something about a problem or not. Is there a chance? […] I have a much better feeling for this today than I had maybe 20 years ago. 

Several of the interviewees noted that new problems were often continuations in some way of previous work. In particular they mentioned that the knowledge obtained from solving one problem naturally led to other problems. Or, less directly, solving one problem can lead the mathematician to see similarities to other problem contexts and recognize this new context could be approached with the right pieces only now seen. 

From their interviews, the authors group the way "continuation" affects problem selection into three categories:
1.) Applying a familiar method to a new area of work
2.) Addressing a question that comes as a natural consequence of an obtained result
3.) seeing similarities between prior research and other areas

Grouping the "Permutation glass" and the "Self-Assembly of a Dimer System" into these categories, it seems that the Permutation glass follows 2. (since it was a natural consequence of the symmetric group paper) and the Self-Assembly work follows both 3. and 1. since it is similar to the symmetric group work and applies some methods from that work to a new class of problems. 

The values of the community

The authors listed a few problem selection factors which were not considered important by the interviewees. 
— administrative management 
— applicability of envisioned results [likely because they were talking to pure mathematicians]
— collaboration with colleagues [again, pure mathematicians]
— funding possibilities

The one factor which was prominent in all the interviews was the values and interests of the mathematical community. One mathematician repeated advice given to him by his advisor: 

Interviewee4: [My supervisor] told me several times that it’s very important to think about what other people are interested in. Because that’s the only way anyone is ever going to know about the results you get. Because even if you do something and you get some results, it’s hard to understand them, nobody is going to invest time in them. They are not interested. And so you might as well not have done it. [Boldface mine]

It is hard for me to believe this, and it is even harder for me to believe mathematicians in general are so ruthlessly self-abnegating. The history of physics and mathematics has many examples of investigators pursuing projects of personal interest seemingly outside of the interests of the larger mathematical community. I’m thinking of Mandelbrot’s work with Zipfs law. Bachelier’s work with Random walks and the stock market. Or John Bell’s work with the consistency of quantum mechanics. These are of course the successful cases and they should not be the standard by which the utility of the principle is judged. Still, I think the principle is a good one, at least from the perspective of the individual’s life. It is generally better to work on things you’re interested in first, and only second consider what other people may find interesting. 

Perhaps, I feel this way because I have often wrestled with the fact that my work is irrelevant to a large portion of the human race. On what basis should I do this work if so many people are indifferent to it? My answer extends from the recognition that this "irrelevance" seems to be a feature of work in general. As a contrast to academic work, people often speak about doing something in the "real world" or something that "matters" to other people, but I think they assume too much about the import of their particular roles in whatever organizations they find themselves. The roles themselves can often be so constrained and regimented that the employee is more of a replaceable piece of a large machine than a crucial element without which the machine would not function. This is to say that even if the work itself is more grounded in the real world, one’s place in the work is less so because one’s contribution is not unique. If you did not exist, the work would likely go on the same way. 

This is my cynical reading of the reality of most people’s lives and it is a cynical reading likely taken on as a defense to the idea that my own work—unlike their own—is not relevant to the real world. But, of course, Their claims and my rebuttal do not reflect all dimensions of the problem of significance. Surely, between my seeming essentiality to my societally irrelevant work and their seeming redundancy in their societally relevant work their is a description which better acknowledged the challenges and supports each of our pursuits lend to our sense of the human condition. 

In any case, my claim that I work according to my own interest may be disingenuous. Before I published my last two papers, I thought carefully about where and how my work could fit into the larger space of the scientific literature. And yet, these questions of context were largely post-considerations, things I thought about only after much of the work was already complete. Before then, I was motivated by a not-entirely-consistent set of things I cannot easily articulate. At one time, I may be disgusted by purely mathematical arguments only to pursue them later as the sole reason to answer a question. At other times, I may disparage unrigorous approximations, only to later take such shortcuts when I need to develop a heuristic explanation. In any of these cases it is not clear what motivates me to complete an investigation, but by and large it does not concern what I think will be of interest to the wider community. 

But maybe this is disingenuous in another direction because it is not clear that I as a physicist who was educated within the community of American physicists will have a completely separate set of interest from my colleagues. This is to say, the things I find personally interesting are at some level the things I believe other people, with sufficient prompting, could find interesting as well. 

Back to the article!

As an explanation as to why the mathematician takes into account what he thinks may interest others, one interviewee stated that he is partly trying to get the attention of some of the leading figures in mathematics. Several other interviewees cited instances when they spent a lot of time working on something only to find that no one else found it interesting. Another had trouble publishing a result which was too niche and thus had to postpone it, even though he found it interesting. 

In all of these cases we see basic sociological forces (e.g., the approval of authority figures, peer acceptance/approval) affecting what mathematicians choose to work on. The authors interpret this in a rather generous light as reflecting the fact that mathematicians are responding to emotional desires to "belong to and resonate with a social group," but my less generous conclusion is that if mathematicians’ choice of problems is so decidedly sociologically implicated then so too is their practice of solving these problems, and they must admit they do not truly hold the mantle of most objective knowledge of the world. 

Another interviewee mentioned the relevance of community in determining how one frames a problem and how fervently one pursues applications. 

Interviewee4: Now that I’m here at this technical university, then I do think about it [applications], because I would like to find problems that students here want to work on [..]. But if I were working at the [a classical university], then I wouldn’t think about whether it was useful…

This statement resonates with my own experience in the Shakhnovich group. I have found that working around people who are interested in the evolutions and physical properties of proteins has led me to think more about how my statistical physics questions can be related to biological systems. Undoubtedly, I would never have started the "Self-Assembly of a Dimer System" investigation had I not been part of this group. 

Discussion

The authors summarize the results of their interviews and present some recommendations for how to incorporate more sophisticated characterizations of mathematical work into the classroom. 

As a first point the authors mention that teachers should help students "choose the right problems," but it is not clear in what contexts students can choose their own problems. The only contexts that come to mind are for research projects. 

The authors also state something I somewhat disagree with. They state that the "individual enquirer should subordinate his or her mathematical interest to an existing value system" such as one suggested by the course work, historical references, or determined by the class. Maybe it is my reflexive American individualism that is poking through, but I don’t see why the interest of a single researcher needs to be subordinated. Indeed it is the diverging interests of various members of the scientific community that provides science with a diversity of ideas and solutions. 

One thing I certainly agree with is the expanded notion of problems conveyed by these interviews. From the interviews, we find that the popular depiction of "problems" in the context of mathematical problem-solving is quite different from the reality of "problems" in research. For one problems in the latter context are not concrete obstacles which are only successfully navigated if they are overcome. Instead, because it is not always clear what exactly the problem is, the mathematician must "work with" the problem to tease from it better formulations and in turn better ways to choose the criteria for solution. 

In the authors words: 

Some problems can have the purpose of guiding a longer investigation into a mathematical area, and such a problem can be very valuable even if it is never solved in full. 

One educational practice the authors suggest is to teach students to see problems as a source for more problems by having them ask for new questions and applications whenever they obtain a mathematical result.

Finishing Parable of the Talents
I finished Octavia Butler’s Parable of the Talents an hour ago. I have learned that categorizing it as science fiction is inaccurate. By one account, science fiction involves the use of science and technology which does not yet exist and may not exist for centuries. Speculative fiction, on the other hand, concerns something more local. It concerns a world which is a natural consequence or evolution of the things which exist today. 

Parable of the Talents certainly fits this definition of speculative fiction, and in the semblance between the world it constructs and the world that I currently occupy it inevitably suggests something sinister about responsibility, agency, and institutions. Namely, if we deny the first, we will fail to make use of the second which would lead to the degradation of the third. In Sower and Talents, Butler depicts a world where degrees of income inequality have ballooned and violence has become so rampant that citizens are not safe from gangs or spontaneous seizures of private property. The police are not to be trusted as they are just as likely to behave as gangs themselves (e.g., extorting money to provide protection, engaging in violence out of boredom), except with the institutional authority of the state. Lauren Olamina, the main character of Sower, manages to survive by developing a makeshift community from strangers on the road and in cities. This community becomes larger and stronger in Talents only to be destroyed by Christian ideologues who seek to "make the country great again" (a literal quote from the 1998 book) by purging the nation of heathens. Lauren, her family, and her friends are conscripted into slavery for seventeen months before they’re able to kill their captors and escape. They’re all forced to scatter, and Lauren then goes through the long process of rebuilding the community she lost. Talents is told through a combination of Lauren’s journal entries and short introductions by Lauren’s daughter, Asha Vere, who was abducted when Lauren was made a slave. 

I am failing to mention a significant aspect of the story: It is shot through which discussions of religion. There is first the explicit presentation of the Christian fanatics. But there is also the quasi-religion called Earthseed created by Lauren her self. The principle tenet of Earthseed is that God is Change and that people must remain aware and ready for this fundamental fact. Later this tenet expands to assert that the destiny of the human race is to explore space beyond our planet and ultimately find homes in other star systems. It is strange how Butler balances her depictions of the harms of one fanatical religion with a demonstration of how another can be a unifying and inspiring force for people. 

In Talents, there is one character who is more than a little disturbing to me. Marc is Lauren’s only surviving brother. When she escaped her first community in Sower, she had believed he was dead, but in Talents, she finds him alive but enslaved. She buys his freedom, and she works to integrate him into the community she created, but he has his own interests. Their father was a preacher and Marc wishes to follow in his footsteps. He believes the President at the time, a man names Jarret who is the nominal head of the Christian fanatics who eventually destroy Lauren’s community, is what the nation needs and he preaches such to Lauren’s friends. They critique his message and he is embarrassed, eventually leaving the community. Shortly after this, Lauren and her friends are attacked by Jarret’s Crusaders and their community is converted into a quasi-prison where they are slaves in all but name alone. Lauren’s daughter is taken away, and after Lauren escapes she finds Marc to ask him for help. But Marc is following his dream. He is a pastor now in Jarret’s Christian America organization, and he cannot accept the idea that anyone associated with the organization would do what Lauren claims they have done.

Earlier, right after she saved him, Lauren noted that Marc seemed to have an obsessive desire to be important to something, to find some place where he could be recognized and valued. He had found this sense of importance as a itinerant pastor in the years before he was enslaved, and after he was freed he tried to find this purpose again. Lauren always loved her brother, even when he did not accept what his colleagues had done to her. But there was a limit to what she could tolerate. Marc eventually found Lauren’s daughter, but never told Lauren. Lauren only learned of her daughter’s existence when that daughter came to visit her in her community. It was then that Lauren learned of Marc’s deception; he had even gone so far as to have told the daughter that Lauren was dead. This was something Lauren could not and did not forgive. 

Marc tried to reconcile with his sister, but she would not see him. 
It is not exactly clear why Marc hid Lauren’s daughter from her. Asha says it was because he was lonely and wanted a family of his own. I read his behavior less generously. I think he was still attached to his identity as a leader in the noble organization of Christian America, and presenting Lauren with the daughter that said organization had taken from her would have been to explicit of an admission that he was a peon of a morally defunct community. 

And what did he get from such denial? I don’t know. His desire to maintain this sense of himself, this makeshift identity, was so blinding that it led him to hurt the one person who had saved him and loved him in spite of all of his vices. 

What is so troubling about all this is that I have felt such a desire in myself, and I have seen the consequences of having that desire frustrated or improperly channeled. The desire itself is bad enough for it makes one blind to so many things, especially the things which could free one from the desire in the first place. I had often assumed it was my place as a minority which made me feel so hugely the need to be better than I was, better than everyone else. But surely this desire exists in the men of this country who are not minorities, but who nevertheless feel they do not yet have the respect, influence, or power they deserve. 

And these feelings do seem to be specific to men. It is men who seem to have a need so deep and all-consuming to satisfy one’s sense of importance, that morality, integrity, and even vision itself are allowed to be sacrificed in its pursuit. 

The ending of the novel was a somewhat jarring jump. From the journal entries, the reader is taken from a journal entry in 2035 to one in 2090 when Lauren’s dream is being fulfilled and her followers are making their first forays beyond Earth’s atmosphere. This seemed somewhat like a copout to me, but after reading an interview by Butler I understand her decision to make this leap. She says she planned to write many more books in the series but had to stop when it became too depressing. 

It is true. These are not the happiest books I have read. By and large they detail the manifold ways humans can be cruel to one another and much less frequently they present examples of human decency. In the past month I have enjoyed reading Talents as a check on my sense of a beautiful and simple world. The world Butler depicts cannot be patently called beautiful and any simplicity one perceives must extend from a superficial reading. But of course, readings of history suggest this is how our world actually is, filled with pain and plunder and nuance and made truly beautiful only by a concerted effort to reconcile all those things. In this way Butler is telling a truth which is difficult to hear because she embeds it in a world at once foreign and recognizable. Unlike, other science fiction stories, it is apparent to me that the world Butler constructs is not at all a fabrication but a mirror to my own. This fact scares me, but it ages me too, forcing me to relinquish comforting narratives about myself and society. Hopefully with this relinquishing I can find the courage to take more responsibility for this world I occupy.

Quotes from "Conversations with Octavia E. Butler"  at the end of Parable of the Talents

The parable of the talents is one of the harsher parables of the Bible, but then, life can be harsh. We human beings will use our talents—our intelligence, our creativity, our ability to plan, to delay gratification, to work for the benefit of the community and of humanity, rather than only for ourselves—…we will lose them. 
pg 409

Sometimes the only thing more dangerous than frightened, confused, desperate people looking for solutions is frightened, confused, desperate people finding and settling for truly bad solutions. 
pg 412 

When I was a girl and the civil rights movement was in full stride, Mrs. Viola Liuzzo, a homemaker, a white woman of Detroit, Michigan, went to Alabama to help in the peaceful struggle for human rights for African Americans. For her trouble, she was murdered by the Ku Klux Klan. Memory of this incident has stayed with me because later in a women’s magazine, I read a number of letters to the editor in which letter writers insisted that it was Mrs. Liuzzo’s duty to stay at home and look after her family. She had no right, the letter writers said, to involve herself in a struggle not her own. She had no right to deprive her husband of a wife, her children of a mother. And, of course, she had no intention of doing any of that. She was murdered, after all. Interesting that not one of those letter writers condemned her murderers. They only condemned her. 
	Duty can be cast as a selfish and shortsighted monster. 
pg 414

I wrote the way I did about education in the two novels because I kept hearing or reading such contempt for public education, and at the same time such enthusiasm for the building and filling of more and more prisons. Shortly after I finished Parable of the Sower I read an L.A. Times story about convicts being forbidden to take college classes. Why? So they would not benefit from their crimes, so they would not learn in prison what others must pay to learn outside of prison. 

But, in fact, people will learn, no matter where they are. We are learning animals, we humans. College classes or no college classes, people will learn. The only question is what they will learn, and what choices they will see before them once they leave prison. 
pg 415

The problem, of course, with throwing people away is that they don’t go away. They stay in the society that turned its back on them. And whether that society likes it or not, they find all sorts of things to do.

Creating "Scientist"
Today I learned that the word "scientist" was coined by William Whewall in an 1834 review of Mary Somerville’s Celestial Mechanics text because her work represented an integration of so many disparate disciplines—mathematics, geology, and astronomy—that a more specific label seemed inappropriate. Here is the brainpickings post which references the source text: https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/12/26/mary-somerville-scientist/

Abstract for CCB Colloquium

First draft
Self-assembly refers to the process by which randomly oriented and/or distributed subunits combine, without external influences, into more ordered structures. Examples of self-assembly include the formation of virus capsids from their constituent proteins and the formation of micelles from phospholipids. One of the most interesting aspects of self-assembly is that in can occur in vitro and, hence, at thermal equilibrium. This fact suggests that it should be possible to completely understand self-assembly through a first-principle statistical physics analysis. We provide an example of such an analysis by considering a thermal equilibrium model of monomers which can form correct and incorrect dimers with one another. The model is "exactly soluble" in that the associated partition function can be written as a closed form integral, and thus is amenable to approximation techniques which define constraints on the system’s two order parameters—the mean number of dimers and the mean number of correct dimers. We find that we can group such dimer systems into two categories contingent on how the mean number of dimers and the mean number of correct dimers vary with temperature. Moreover, the system is characterized by two transition temperatures each defining deviation from complete and correct assembly and complete but incorrect assembly. In all, the model represents a good proof of concept of how combinatorics can be used in statistical physics to exactly calculate the partition functions of self-assembly systems.

 One of the most interesting aspects of biomolecule self-assembly is that in can occur \textit{in vitro} and, thus, at thermal equilibrium. This latter fact suggests self-assembly should be amenable to a first-principle statistical physics analysis. We make an initial step toward such a general analysis by considering the combinatorics of how distinguishable subunits form correct contacts with other subunits in a fixed volume. This study represents a first step, rather than a complete solution to the self-assembly problem, because self-assembly often involves the assemblage of large extended bodies from individual subunits. However, before these extended bodies can be formed, the individual subunits need to distinguish their correct contacts from a sea of incorrect contacts, and, moreover, must often do so under the mere influence of energy and entropy. Thus, building an analytical model which describes the conditions under which individual subunits form correct contacts with each other could lead to qualitative insight into the general properties of self-assembly.

Meeting with Eugene

I just left my meeting with Eugene. The meeting was a sort of "debriefing" from my group meeting presentation. My plan was to explain that, given the discussion during my group meeting, I had decided that my model was not applicable to protein-protein interactions and should instead be considered only as a toy model of self-assembly. Eugene agreed that the model was not currently applicable to PPIs, but he then suggested I generalize it so that it was. His argument was that the PPI system was perhaps a more interesting physical system than the self-assembly system and being able to generalize my model would make any mathematically derived partition function more relevant to a wider class of systems. 




Still, the systems were different and even if the self-assembly work was less interesting in his opinion, I still thought it deserved to be published. Would it make sense to split the work into two papers: one for self-assembly and another for protein-protein interactions—assuming I could find the relevant partition function for the latter? Eugene said that it would depend on how I wanted to strategize the work. 

I thought this was an interesting choice of words. He clarified that I could write individual papers for each physical system, but doing so might give the impression that the models were just a random collection of interesting, but disconnected, mathematical results. However, another option would be to begin more generally by first noting that there exists a class of combinatorial techniques which allow one to analyze biophysical systems that are defined by contacts between subunits. We could then state that the systems we will consider are ones of self-assembly, protein-protein interactions, and transcription factor-DNA interactions. The work would be mathematical in its use of combinatorics, physical in its use of statistical physics, and biological in its discussion of molecular systems. It would thus be of interest to a wider array of scientists and be more comprehensive (i.e., authoritative) than it would be otherwise. 

Eugene also said I could publish the derived partition function just as it was, but because there is only a very small group of physicists who are interested in exactly soluble mathematical models of physical systems, the work would only have limited impact on the physics community. However, by making the scope larger I could attract a wider group of scientists (physicists, chemists, and biologists) and thereby give the work more coverage. He was—consciously or not—appealing to my ego, and I must say the appeal was a successful one. Who doesn’t want to write a deep and definitive work on some topic in one’s field? Most people have to content themselves with more niche work, disparate solutions to disparate problems. But if you could somehow show that all of your various routes are merely tributaries leading away from some larger source, why wouldn’t you do so?

In a way, Eugene was reminding me of the ambition I had in my proverbial youth. I first entered physics because I was seduced by grand mathematical models in mechanics and electromagnetism, but after years training and learning how to train myself to become a physicist, I realized that the daily work is more humdrum, and in order to not lose resolve, one must often find satisfaction in short solutions to short problems. The issue is that once this small-scale satisfaction is cultivated and one at last finds enjoyment in the slow and steady beat of simple work, the short-game can become a habit and soon afterwards one even forgets that longer-term plays exist. In some sense, all the lessons I have unearthed about choosing problems, articulating research directions, and seeking solutions have made me so focused on the small steps of research that I have lost sight of the larger picture. I had always liked to believe I was someone of great vision and insight, but in reality I had been trapped in myopia, a myopia which an honest appraisal would suggest was cultivated by impatience and insecurity. So, I now realize that I am fortunate to have had Eugene here to remind me of what I had forgotten. 

This introduction is to say the focus of the work has expanded. I will try to derive a gendered partition function for subunits that can combine into correct and incorrect dimers where each subunit can exist in multiple copies. I will also try to derive a non-gendered partition function for a similar case. As far as I can tell the gendered case should be possible given what I have now derived, but the non-gendered case would require me to derive combinatorial results I do not have and do not know how to obtain. Perhaps I could guess them? Who knows. In any case, the current correspondence between biophysical systems and model is as follows:
— Self Assembly - Non-gendered and one of each type
— PPI - Non-gendered and multiple of each type
— Transcription Factor-DNA - Gendered and multiple of each type

During the meeting we also discussed the fact of authorship. Yesterday, Eugene sent me an email suggesting this be a joint collaboration. Today I asked for some elaboration as to why. He gave me two reasons: First, although I came to the group with the Permutation glass and Statistical physics of the symmetric group problems, my more recent work seemed to be a more unambiguous result of discussions I had within the group. I must admit this reason alone was not convincing to me. It is true that I was led to begin this work from discussions I had within the group, but I didn’t think this itself justified anything more than the appropriate acknowledgement. Eugene prefaced his second reason by noting that it was a  political one: It would look strange if I were to graduate without having any joint publications with my thesis advisor. For all my subversiveness, this reason made some sense to me. Eugene mentioned that such strange cases did occur but that they were atypical. I realize now I should have asked him about the circumstances of those cases. 

Still none of these reasons is sufficiently compelling to justify adding his name to work primarily done by me. In fact, however, these reasons were unnecessary because Eugene had already provided the best reason earlier in our discussion. He had suggested a larger framing for the work, one which if successfully pursued would greatly augment the quality of the resulting paper. 

In the end Eugene stated that it was up to me whether or not I wanted this to be a joint publication. I could just as well do the work alone if I wanted. I could not sense any subtext in this statement. He seemed to honestly believe it was ultimately my decision. 

I told him that I was appreciative of his previous comments and that it would be useful to situate the work in a larger context. In other words he had already contributed non-trivially to the project, and hopefully we could continue to work on it together.

Who was she thinking about when her eyes were closed and I was inside her? It was certainly not me. She wouldn't look at me the way she did during the day had she been thinking of me when we were together at night.

[Copied from earlier in notes]

The class of 2013 at Nu Delta was largely a class composed of fraternal outcasts. Very few of us integrated comfortably into the existing structure of Nu Delta but each failed at this integration in ways unique and yet ultimately predictable.

Settling In: It seems to take about two hours of metaphorically banging your head against the wall before you can get into the mood for writing. During these two hours you have to try to stay focused on your writing while not allowing overly high standards demoralize you and make you unwilling to continue on. It would not be inaccurate to say, getting through these two hours requires some amount of faith that something less frustrating lies on the other end. 

Headlights: It is not necessary to have a "grand vision" for your writing in order to be able to write. Instead, it is quite possible to experience your writing as a sort of Markov process in which you progress forward entirely based on where you currently are. In this way your writing can without an overall plan and instead only with attention to what you think should come next. 


Helpful Immersion: Writing an essay (and even more so a story) requires a large degree of mental space distinct from the temporal "space" you allot for the task. You can try to block out an hour or two for writing on the weekend, but often in order to resolve questions about structure and direction you need more than just time. You need to be working over the details of the writing even in your breaks. I think I've always experienced this but it became very clear to me while I was writing "The One-Body Problem."  I became stuck at many points and I was only able to make progress after putting the writing aside and thinking about the work from a larger scope. During such "large-scale" thinking it's useful to not have other narratives or other problems in your head. The immersion in your current project helps you think of less direct ways to complete it. 

Puzzle Pieces don't work for stories: Another lesson I learned when writing "The One-Body Problem" is that writing distinct paragraphs for the story and then trying to assembly them together doesn't really work. It kind of works for essays and it absolutely works for research pieces (at least I think it does!), but stories require a more seamless development which is disrupted by copy-paste editing. I am not entirely sure the scale at which this rule no longer applies. It might be possible to write chapters of a novel in distinct pieces, but I find it does not work for my ~2000 word pieces. A much better approach is to start from somewhere (preferably near the beginning) and write continuously until you reach the end. This way each section can respond to the mood established by the previous one.

Notes on Paradox by Margaret Cuonzo
I'm reading Cuonzo's book and I am finding it simple and insightful. Mostly insightful, that is. The first chapter provides a quantitative definition of "paradoxicality" which I don't think provides the use she claims. Rather than providing a clear ranking between various paradoxes, it seems to better reveal how the sense of whether something is a paradox is highly subjective. She does have one quote that I think is quite nice.

Paradoxes force us to question whether our intuitive understanding of the world is really accurate. 

Chapter 1: New way to think of paradoxes and solutions

1] How do paradoxes help us solidify our knowledge? 

Paradoxes are questions or problems which lead to contradictory answers or solutions after applying seemingly reasonable arguments. The fact that such contradictions are derived from antecedents and logical inferences which seem reasonable forces us to ask "What about our assumptions and the way we solve problems is flawed?" Asking such questions can help us to better understand the things we feel we already know well. 

2] What is the basic liar's paradox? 

The basic liar's paradox refers to the paradoxical statement: "This statement is false." The statement is paradoxical because we can argue that if it is true, then it must be false, and if it false, then it must be true. The paradox can be resolved by claiming that some statements do not fall into the exclusive categories of being either true or false. This solution is called rejecting the "principle of bivalence" 

The strengthened liar's paradox refers to the paradoxical statement: "This statement is not true." As opposed to the apparent acceptability of the basic liar's paradox resolution that something can be both true and false, the strengthened liar's paradox suggests that something can be both "true" and "not true". This later suggestion seems stranger because "true" and "not true" appear to be directly opposite. Specifically, the "law of the excluded middle" says that either P or ~P can be true and that P OR ~P is always true. The strengthened liar's paradox contradicts this law. 

3] What is the "enrichment paradox?"

The "enrichment paradox" is described as follows. Say you have a population of predator and prey where the predators consume the prey, and the prey consume some resource. Naively, one would expect the number of prey to increase in proportion to the amount of resource, and the number of predators to increase in proportion to the number of prey. Therefore, with more resources, our ecosystem should eventually have more predators. However, Cuonzo states, what is found in reality is that after an initial increase in the number of predators, the predator population becomes destabilized and risks collapse. 

This is an interesting result and it does run counter to what you would expect from simple predator prey models. 

4] What is the sorites paradox? 

Here is the basic formulation of the sorites paradox. A man with 0 hairs on his head is bald. A man with n hairs on his head has the same "baldness" as a man with n+1 hairs on his head. Therefore, a man with 100000 hairs on his head must be bald. 

5] How does Cuonzo define the paradoxicality of a paradox? Critique this definition. 

If a paradox consists of premises followed by an inference which lead to a conclusion, Cuonzo defines the paradoxicality by the equation

, 

where Pr(p1, …,pn) is the subjective probability that all the premises are true, Prnu is the subjective probability that the reasoning is valid, and Prc is the subjective probability that the conclusion is true; 1-Prc is therefore the subjective probability that the conclusion of the argument is false. 

Conversely, if the paradox consists of a set of statements, Cuonzo defines the paradoxicality by the equation 

,

where Pr(s1, … sn) is the subjective probability that all statements are true and Pr(i) is the probability that these statements are inconsistent. 

Subjective probability is the degree to which a rational observer believes something. We consider two examples. Say we have an argument where we believe that all of the premises are true, that the argument is valid, and that the conclusion is true. Then Pr(p1,…, pn) = 1, Prnu = 1, and Prc = 1. Thus the paradoxicality of this argument would be 0. 

But for the Sorites paradox, we have something like Pr(p1, p2) = .95 (this is the probability that someone being bald is true AND that n hairs and n+1 hairs representing the same baldness is true), Prnu = 1 (argument is valid), and Prc = 0 (someone with 1000000 hairs on his head is clearly not bald, so the conclusion is false). Therefore, we can conclude the paradoxicality of the argument is 0.95. 


My problem with Cuonzo's definitions is that they seem to replace a qualitative notion of paradox with a quantitative definition whose exact value is largely subjective. The use of subjective probabilities in these formulas reveals that how "paradoxical" something is depends on the assumptions the observer or problem solver brings into the evaluation of the paradox. Namely, different people can have different values for the various probabilities listed above. However, there is still something universal about paradoxes when they are used as a sort of appraisal of how a culture uses (and perhaps misuses) language. Cuonzo's definitions obscure this universality by making the evaluation of the strangeness of a paradox seem subjective, when in fact the strangeness comes from the fact that colloquial concepts derived from a particular culture's use of a particular language are not always rigorous or precise. 

6] What is the paradoxicality paradox? 

The paradoxicality paradox is a combination of the sorites paradox and Cuonzo's definition of paradoxicality. Here is Cuonzo's presentation of it: 

An argument with a paradoxicality rating of 0 is nonparadoxical. 
For any number n, if an argument with a paradoxicality rating of n is nonparadoxical, then an argument with a paradoxicalit rating of n+0.001 is nonparadoxical. 
An argument with a paradoxical rating of 1 is nonparadoxical. 

The final statement is contradictory because 1 is the highest paradoxicality rating and a statement with that rating should surely be paradoxical. 

One resolution to this paradox can be grounded in the argument that Cuonzo's paradoxicality definitions are not correct ways to get at the nature of paradox. Namely, I would claim that the paradoxicality paradox is not really paradoxical because Cuonzo's definition of paradoxicality is incorrect. What this paradox perhaps reveals is that any numerical definition of paradox would be too flawed to give us a consistent intepretation of paradoxes since we could always apply a sorites argument to it. 

Chapter 2: How to solve paradoxes

2.1 Solutions as reeducations of intuition

1] What is the Monty Hall Paradox? What is the resolution? 

The "Monty Hall paradox" or rather the "Monty Hall game" is as follows. You are a contestant on a game show and you want to win a car. To do so, you must correctly choose the single door out of three doors behind which the car resides. The other two doors hide goats, and the game show host knows what is behind all the doors. You make your first choice, and the game show host does not reveal what is behind your door. Instead, he always reveals a goat which is behind one of the doors you did not choose. Here are the questions: Is it better to keep your first door or to switch to a new one, and if you switch to a new one, what is the probability of your winning the car?

One answer is that it doesn't matter whether or not you switch. You would still have a 1/3 probability of winning the car. This answer is not correct because 1/3 represents the chance that you chose the car in your initial selection; in order to compute the probability that you select the car when you switch you have to do another calculation.

As a follow up answer one might say "OK, so the probability should be 1/2 for you to select the car when you switch." This answer is not correct either. The probability would be 1/2 for selecting a car if you only had to choose between two doors, independent of any of your prior actions or the actions of the game show host. But since you know what door you selected first, and the door the game show host selected—and, more importantly, that the game show host always reveals the goat—your information in these two situations is not identical. 

The actual resolution is most easily found by considering the perspective of the game show host. Note that there is a 1/3 chance that you chose the car in your initial selection, and hence a 2/3 chance that you selected one of the goats. Consequently, when the gameshow host reveals the goat, there is a 2/3 chance that he is revealing the remaining goat that you did not pick. Therefore, there is a 2/3 chance that the door you did not pick and the door the game show host did not reveal is the door behind which the car resides.

The "Monty hall game" reveals that our evaluations of the probability of events in a system are dependent on the information we have about the system and that when our information changes so too do our original probabilities. For example, one can construct a bayesian argument for the 2/3 argued intuitively above. 

The "Monty hall game" also could reveal some intrinsic narcissism in how people evaluate probabilities. The solution is quite simple when one considers the perspective of the game show host, but very few people do this even after they realize there is something incomplete about a naive appraisal. 

2] What are Cuonzo's six solution types for resolving a paradox. 

o Claim that a central notion of the paradox is flawed (Preemptive Strike)
o Identify a flawed statement or premise in the paradox (Odd Guy Out) 
o Deny that the paradox is inconsistent at all (It's all good)
o Show that reasoning in the paradox is flawed (You can't get there from here)
o Accept the paradox, but provide an alternative notion of something fundamental to it (Detour Solution)
o Accept the paradox (Facing the Music) 

2.2 Solution Type 1: Questioning the Paradoxical Entity

1] What is Rule V of Gottlob Frege's Naive Set Theory?

Rule V states that a set can be formed given any property that elements of that set must satisfy. For example, Rule V states you can from sets from properties like
o all the people in the state of massachusetts
o positive integers

Rule V is called the unrestricted comprehension axiom. It's formal statement (transcribed from https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/) is 

Given any formula  containing  as a free variable, there will exist the set whose members are exactly those  that satisfy . For example, if  stands for " is prime" then  is the set of all prime numbers. Or if  stands for "" then  is the empty set. 

2] What is Russel's paradox? Why is it a problem for Naive Set Theory?

Russel's paradox constructs a set of all sets which satisfy the property that the "set is not a member of itself". This is usually written as  so that . The question: Is  or is ? If , then by the definition of the set,  does not satisfy  and so . Conversely, if , then by the definition of the set,  does satisfy  and so . In all, if  is a member of , then it can't be a member of , and if  is not a member of  then it must be a member of . In classical logic, only one case can hold and so  gives us a contradiction. 

This is a problem for Naive Set Theory because the theory only states that one needs a property in order to form a set. We have chosen a property and yet we have found a contradiction. 

3] Give three examples of finite sets and three examples of infinite sets

Finite sets
o the set of objects on the surface of my desk
o the set of people in Physics 101
o the set of integers between 1 and 10

Infinite sets
o the set of real numbers 
o the set of natural numbers
o the set of all sets with two elements

4] In Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory what are the axiom of extensionality, the axiom of regularity, and the axiom schema of restricted comprehension? 

The axiom of extensionality states that any two sets are equal if they have the same members. Thus the set of even natural numbers below 10 is equal to the set of multiples of 2 below 10. 

The axiom of regularity states that every nonempty set A contains at least one element B that has no members in A. A valid set under this axiom would be  where ,  , and . We then have  and . Thus  contains an element with which it is disjoint. 

An important consequence of this axiom is that a set  cannot be a member of itself. We can understand this by forming the set . By the axiom of regularity the set  contains an element with which it is disjoint. However, the only element that  contains is the set . Thus we must have that . This implies that  and  have no elements in common. The only element in  is , so if  and  have no elements in common then  is not an element of  (i.e., ). In other words a set cannot be a member of itself. (See https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2537526/axiom-of-regularity-allows-for-this-set-be-an-element-of-itself)

The axiom schema of restricted comprehension states that given any set and any property (that may or may not characterize elements of that set), there is a subset of the set that contains all the elements that satisfy that property. For example, let's say we had the set X = {Bolaji, Ajoke, Barack, Gbadetole, Bosede, James} and the property "members of my family," then the set Y given the stated property would be Y = {Bolaji, Ajoke, Gbadetole, Bosede}. 

4a] Does the axiom of regularity still apply if a set only has elements which are not themselves sets? Why? 

According to an answer on math.stackexchange (https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/204865/axiom-of-regularity) "everything is a set". So if you have a set  then even though the elements 1, 2, and 3 are not denoted as sets, we interpret them as sets. The axiom of regularity states that one of these sets is disjoint from X. 

5] How does the set defining Russel's paradox violate the axiom schema of restricted comprehension? 

Naive set theory states any property defines a set, but the axiom schema of restricted comprehension (SRC) states that only properties which can also define subsets of sets are valid properties. The property "all sets that are not members of themselves" is simply a property (without regard to the larger set) and thus Russell's set is not well founded. 

Namely for ZF theory, given a property  and a set , we form a new set according to  and not merely according to . We can then redefine Russell's set so that there is no paradox. Say we have the set Then if  and , then we reach a contradiction. We also have a contradiction if we assume  and . Thus, we can only conclude that . What is ?  is a set which we know to exist and which we have constructed through unions of other simpler sets. This construction of Russel's paradox essentially asserts that R cannot be a subset of any such valid set and therefore R is not itself a set. 

*This latter point that sets are constructed from other valid sets is particularly important, otherwise we could consider the existence of a universal set (i.e., the set of all other sets). Such a universal set would contradict the axiom of regularity anyway. 

6] Give a list of three sets (or rather three properties) that violate the axiom schema of restricted comprehension and explain why they violate this axiom.

Sets violate the axiom schema of restricted comprehension when they are defined by properties alone without reference to other sets which we know to be valid sets. So the set of all english words, the set of all people who were ever born, and the set of all sets violate the axiom schema of restricted comprehension. (The latter set violates the axiom of regularity because the set of all sets contains itself)

2.3 Solution Type 2: Pointing to the Flawed Assumption

1] What is the unexpected examination paradox? What is the resolution of the paradox? 

The unexpected examination paradox is presented as follows: One day in class, a teacher announces that an unexpected examination will occur on any day at noon during the following school week. The students decide that this cannot be. They reason that if the exam were to have not arrived by Thursday mid-afternoon, then the students would expect to have the exam on Friday. Since the exam would be expected to occur on Friday, then it cannot occur on Friday (because it is an "unexpected" examination). Thus, if the exam were to have not arrived by Wednesday mid afternoon, then the students would expect to have the exam on Thursday because the unexpected exam could not fall on Friday. By iterating this reasoning, the students conclude that the exam does not occur on any day and they choose not to study. Next week comes and, much to the dismay of the students, the exam falls on Wednesday. 

The resolution to the paradox comes from recognizing the students incorrect interpretation of the word "unexpected". By "unexpected" the teacher could be seen to have meant "random", that is the exam would occur on a day of the week that the students would not be able to determine. However, the students interpreted "unexpected" to mean that they would not "expect" to be taking the exam on whatever day they do eventually take it. However, since they know the exam will be occurring on some day of the week they will always be expecting it in this sense, and so this interpretation of "unexpected" is incorrect. 

In general paradoxes seem to stem from two sources
Unqualified and unarticulated assumptions 
Vagaries in informal use of language. 

The unexpected examination falls into the latter category

2] What is modus tollens (i.e., the hypothetico-deductive model)? Make sure to include the logical axiom that Cuonzo does not mention. 

Modus tollens is constructed as follows
1- If P, then Q
2- If not Q, then not P [Logical Contrapositive of 1]
2a- not Q
3- not P

3] How is modus tollens used in scientific hypothesis testing? 

We construct the hypothetico-deductive model as follows. 
1- If H, then e
2- not e
3- not H

In scientific hypothesis testing one tries to test P by testing whether its implication Q is satisfied. When Q is not satisfied, we can conclude that P is not satisfied because P directly implies Q. This argument is the foundation for all tests of models in science. 

4] Explain why "not e" and "H -> e" are not perfect steps in actual scientific hypothesis testing.

When one tests a model, one is often testing a prediction of the model. If one finds that the prediction does not manifest in one's observations, then one could reject the model. However, it is not always clear why the prediction is not manifest in one's observations. One reason (outside claiming that the hypothesis itself is invalid) is that the observations were not performed correctly.

Also "H -> e" is not a perfect step because deriving a prediction from a model often requires making many subsidiary assumptions. How we choose these assumptions could lead to various predictions thus allowing "H" to be connected to multiple "e". 

5] What is the simple Quine/Duhem Paradox?

The paradox is states as follows

1- No hypothesis can be isolated from an indefinite set of auxiliary hypotheses. 
2- In order to show that a particular hypothesis is incorrect, it is necessary to isolate it from its set of auxiliary hypotheses. 
3- No hypothesis can be shown to be incorrect.

6] What is Bayes theorem? How do Bayesians resolve the simple Quine/Duhem Paradox?

Bayes theorem states/shows how subjective probabilities are updated by evidence. The formal statement of Bayes theorem is 



Bayesians resolve the simple Quine/Duhem paradox by making the acceptance or rejection of a hypothesis probabilistic. Cuonzo states "According to the Bayesian model, evidence e  confirms a hypothesis H to the extent that a scientist's degree of belief H is higher given evidence e than what it was or would be without this evidence." If the posterior probability is higher than the prior probability then the hypothesis is confirmed according to the difference between the two (in some undetermined fashion). 

Bayesians reject the second premise of the simple Quine/Duhem paradox. They claim that as long as the prior beliefs in the auxiliary hypothesis are known, then it is possible to determine when they should be rejected. 

7] What problems does Cuonzo cite for this resolution of the simple Quine/Duhem paradox?

Cuonzo states that the main problem with the Bayesian resolution is its dependence on subjective probability. This probability is highly variable from person to person, but also from time to time for the same person. This variability is due to the fact that the probability depends more on the scientists confidence in his or her hypothesis rather than any prior evidence that said hypothesis is true. In this way, Cuonzo's critique of the Bayesians is similar to my critique of Cuonzo's quantitative definition of "paradoxicality". 

8] Write out explicitly the computation given at the end of 2.3.3

[Follows the discussion in the notes to Cuonzo's book. I do not understand her discussion]

This computation gives an example of how Bayes theorem can lead to the rejection of an auxiliary hypothesis and the preservation of a main hypothesis. Say that we are testing whether drinking coffee causes cancer. This statement is our hypothesis H. The auxiliary hypothesis (our A) of our test is that the people we consider have similar health histories. Say that we observe not e, namely that drinking coffee does not seem to correlate with increased occurrence of cancer. Do we reject A or do we reject H?

By our model we take P(e | H and A) = 1.0 and P(not e | H and A) = 0.0. We have a strong prior probability for H (that drinking coffee causes cancer), so we take P(H) = 0.9. We have a weaker prior probability for A (that everyone in the sample has similar health histories), so we take 0.6, which is just above neutral. 

We want to calculate P(H | not e) and P(A | not e) and compare both of these quantities to their prior probabilities. By Bayes we have 



but 



In the text, we take  (i.e., the probability that the hypothesis is we get no difference in cancer occurrence given that the hypothesis is true and the auxiliary hypothesis is false)  to be 50x where x is the small quantity 0.001. Computing these quantities out we find 



Similarly, we have 

.

Here we take  to be x where x is 0.001. Comparing this result to , we see that we have made the assumption that is much more likely to observe no difference in cancer occurrence when the hypothesis is not true and the auxiliary hypothesis is true, than it is to observe no difference in cancer occurrence when the hypothesis is true and the auxiliary hypothesis is not true. One could claim that this choice is circular because it in a way assume what we are trying to prove (namely that the hypothesis is more robust than the auxiliary hypothesis). 

We also take  = 50x, which is another assumption. Computing this out, gives us 




And so 



Similarly, we have 



where 



and 

,

so that 

,

Because P(A | not e) is much lower than P(A), but P(H | not e) is essentially the same as P(H), we would reject the auxiliary hypothesis in this scenario. 

I don't think this example is very convincing. For example, why can we assume  = 0.001? Assuming this leads to  = 0.999, which asserts that if the hypothesis is true we expect to observe a difference in cancer occurrence even if our sample of people DO NOT have similar health histories. This assumption exists as the less perfect case relative to . Apparently, having the auxiliary hypothesis violated only slightly reduces the probability that the model makes the stated prediction. Why can we make the assumption?
Moreover, why can we assume ? This condition seems to assume that taking the hypothesis to be invalid more likely results in not seeing any difference in cancer than does taking the hypothesis to be valid. In other words, we are assuming that the validity of the main hypothesis is more central to the observance of cancer than is the auxiliary hypothesis. But isn't this what we're trying to prove?

9] What is Zeno's dichotomy paradox? What is the resolution?

Zeno's dichotomy paradox is as follows. Say that a man is traveling a distance L, but to do so he first travels a distance L/2, then a distance L/4, followed by a distance L/8, and so on with his displacements decreasing by powers of 2. Because he must make an infinite number of such steps, he never reaches his final destination L in a finite amount of time. 

The resolution comes from the fact that it is in deed possible to make an infinite number of steps in a finite amount of time, if the time for each step decreases in the same way as the distance for each step. In essence, requiring that the time t_n decreases in the same way as the distance d_n is simply stating that the velocity v_0 is constant. Namely, we have  and , thus  for all n. The total distance traveled by the man is still L as can be shown by summing the appropriate geometric series. 

2.4 Solution Type 3: Denying the validity of the reasoning

1] What is the example Cuonzo gives of the skeptical?

Cuonzo's skeptical paradox is as follows. I can only know that I am in Boston if I know that I am not dreaming. I cannot know that I am not dreaming, therefore I cannot know that I am in Boston. 

2] What is the contextualist solution to Cuonzo's example of the skeptical paradox?

Cuonzo's contextualist solution to her example of the skeptical paradox is to assert that although we cannot know something on the level that we know that we are not dreaming, this level of knowledge is not what we mean when we say "I know I am in Boston." Namely, our interpretation of the word "knowledge" is contextual and "to know" in the first premise means something different from "to know" in the second premise. 

3] What is an invalid argument form? How can we phrase the "Unexpected Examination" paradox as an invalid argument form? How can we write the skeptical  paradox as an invalid argument? What is a third example?

An invalid argument form has the following structure 

P, only if Q
Not R
Therefore, not P

Since premise 2 has no bearing on premise 1, the conclusion reached in 3 is not valid. The difficulty in establishing that an argument matches the above structure is showing that two premises refer to two different uses or interpretations of the same phrase. 

We can write the unexpected examination in an invalid argument form as follows

Students will have their exam on next week, only if the exam occurs on a random day.
Students will always expect to have their exam next week.
Therefore, students will not have their exam next week. 

We can write the skeptical paradox in an invalid argument form as follows 

I can only know for sure that I am in Boston only if I know that I am not dreaming. 
I cannot be absolutely certain that I am not dreaming.
Therefore, I cannot know for sure that I am in Boston. 

4] What is fuzzy logic's truth conditions?

Fuzzy logic's truth conditions are as follows. We will take /P/ to signify "the value of P". 

1) /~P/ = 1- /P/
2) /P and Q/ = Min(/P/, /Q/)
3) /P or Q/ = Max(/P/, /Q/)
4) /P -> Q/ = Min(1, 1- /P/+/Q/)
5) /(for all x A(x)/= the greatest lower bound of the values /A(t)/ for each name t
6) /(there exists x A(x)/ = the least upper bound of the values /A(t)/ for each name t

5] Explain each row of the truth table in the conditions "P -> Q"

ANSWER ME!

6] Why, in fuzzy logic, does the conditional "P -> Q" require a new definition besides "not P or Q"

In classical logic, the conditional "P -> Q" is short hand for "(~P)  or Q". If we were to take Q = P, then classical logic gives us "P -> P = (~P) or P" which is always 1. But by 3) in the fuzzy logic truth conditions, "(~P) or P" is Max(~P, P) which is not always 1 unless P = 1. In order to preserve the fact that "P -> P =1", fuzzy logic introduces the definition /P -> Q/ = Min(1, 1- /P/+/Q/). This would give us /P -> P/ = Min(1, 1) = 1 as desired. 

It is interesting that fuzzy logic works to preserve the conditions P -> P. Why does it preserve this conditional in lieu of other ideas in conditional logic? Are we to take this conditional as more fundamental than the other ideas like the idea that statements are either true or false? 

7] What is the fuzzy logic solution of the sorites paradox? 

Fuzzy logic provides a sort of incremental solution to the sorites paradox. It rates as completely true the premise "A man with 0 hairs on his head is bald" and it rates as slightly less true the conclusion that a man with 1 hair on his head is bald. In this way the truth values of consequents decrease until 0 after which the truth values of conclusions remain at 0 as we add more hairs. 

Here is the short mathematics 
1) A man with 0 hairs on his head is bald (Truth value= 1)
2) If a man with 0 hairs on his head is bald, then a man with (0+1) hairs on his head is bald (Truth value = 1- 1 + 0.95)
3) A man with 1 hair on his head is bald (Truth value = 0.95)

8] What is a conjunction and a disjunction? How does fuzzy logic run counter to our traditional notions of conjunctions and disjunctions?

A conjunction is a statement of the form P and Q. A disjunction is a statement of the form P or Q. Fuzzy logic runs counter to our traditional notions of conjunctions and disjunctions in how it handles the case where Q = ~ P. 

For example, in classical logic, the statement "This patch is red AND This patch is not red" is always false. However, in fuzzy logic, if "This patch is red" has a truth value of 1/9 then the truth value of "This patch is red and This patch is not red" would be 1/9. 

Also in classical logic, the statement "This patch is red OR This patch is not red" is always true. However, in fuzzy logic, if "This patch is red" has a truth value of 1/9 then the truth value of  "This patch is red OR This patch is not red" would be 8/9. 

In short, fuzzy logic makes conjunctions of opposites not always false and the disjunctions of opposites not always true. 

9] What is the law of non contradiction? What is the law of the excluded middle? 

The law of non-contradiction states that "P and not P" is always false. The law of the excluded middle states that "P or not P" is always true. 

10] How does "fuzzy logic" not resolve the essence of the sorites paradox? 

Fuzzy logic does not resolve the essence of the sorites paradox because it still does not define what exactly "baldness" is. It associates incremental values of truth with various numbers of hairs on a person's head, but it does not tell us what truth value we should take as definitive of baldness. 

2.5 Solution Type 4: Arguing all parts of the paradox are fine

1] What is disjunctive syllogism? 

A disjunctive syllogism is an argument of the form 

Either P or Q
Not Q
Therefore, P

It is often used to show how contradictions allow anything to be true. 

2] What is paraconsistent logic?

Paraconsistent logic is a type of logic which seeks to effective deal with contradictions such that these contradictions do not imply explosions. Paraconsistent logic does this by eliminating disjunctive introduction (that if A is true/satisfied we have A or B as true/satisfied) or by eliminating disjunctive syllogism (described above). 

3] How can contradictions show that anything can be true? (Give an example)

The formal presentation of how contradictions entail anything as true is as follows 

1) P and ~P [Starting Point]
2) P [Conjunctive Elimination from 1]
3) P or A [Disjunctive Introduction from P]
4) ~P [Conjunctive Elimination from 1]
5) Therefore, A [Disjunctive Syllogism from 3 and 4]

For example, let's say P = "Statement X is true," and ~P = "Statement X is not true." If we have P and ~P as both true, then P is by itself true. Let A be the calculation 2+2 = 5. Then, disjunctive introduction we can claim that Either "Statement X is true" is true or 2+2 = 5. Since we know that "Statement X is not true," is true and hence that Statement X is false, we can conclude that 2+2=5 by disjunctive syllogism. 

4] What is key in accepting contradictions in a logical system? i.e., what is essential in paraconsistent logic?

In paraconsistent logic, one must make the above proof invalid. This entails eliminating one of the reasons for moving from one step to the next. Thus we must relinquish conjunctive elimination, disjunctive introduction, or disjunctive syllogism. 

6] Can mathematics be done with any logical system other than classical logic? 

I don't know. ANSWER ME!!

7] What is the paradox of taste? What is the resolution of the paradox of taste? 




2.6 Solution Type 5: Creating Alternative Notions 

1] How is the "Detour" solution type different from the previous solution types? 

The "Detour" solution type does not seek to lower the subjective probability that any of the premises or conclusions of the paradox are correct. Instead, this solution type seeks to work around the paradox by creating definitions of terms and phrases alternative to the definitions used in the paradox as stated. 

2] What is Tarski's distinction between object languages and metalanguages? 

Object language is language that is used by the speakers of the language to describe objects and events. Metalanguage is language that is used to talk about the language itself. Informal uses of english do not distinguish between these two levels of language. 

3] What is meant by satisfaction? What are its requirements? 

Satisfaction is Tarski's precise notion of truth. Satisfaction relates objects and "sentential functions". For example, a sentential function would be x is a nephew where x is a free variable. Once the free variable x is replaced by an object like "Anthony" the sentential function becomes a sentence as in "Anthony is a nephew."

4] What is Convention T for Tarski's notion of language? 

Convention T is the assertion that a statement in a language is only true when the statement is true when used by speakers of the language and not merely when the statement is described. For example the statement "book is blue" is only true if in fact the book is actually blue. 



5] What is the Grelling paradox?

Grelling's paradox is a self-referential paradox concerning the words heterological and homological. Heterological refers to words that are not true of their own names. Homological refers to words that are true of their own names. For example, the word short is a short word so it is homological. 

The paradox arises from a question: Is the word heterological itself heterological? If heterological is heterological than it is true of its own name and hence it is homological. If heterological is not heterological then it is not true of its own name and hence it is homological. 

6] What is the Definability paradox?

The definability paradox is one in which a concept is defined in a way that leads to a contradiction. 

For example, if we let A be the set of all positive integers that can be defined in fewer than 100 words, then there must be some integer n that requires more than 100 words to define it. But then, we could just define this integer as "the smallest integer that requires more than 100 words to define it" and we have just defined this integer in less than 100 words. 

7] How does Tarski's Convention T resolve the Liar's, Grelling, and Definability paradox?

Tarski's Convention T resolves these paradoxes by pointing out that they are conflating two different levels of the language. Tarski would say 

"This statement is false" is true if and only if indeed this statement is false. However, since the latter object does not occur in any real circumstance it is improperly formed and has no truth value. 
*Further reading states that Tarski's Convention T has hierarchical levels of truth and the problem with the Liar's paradox is that it conflates both levels and is thus a poorly formed sentence. 

Similarly, one would say that "The word heterological is heterological" is true if and only if heterological is heterological. But again the latter object does not occur in any real circumstance so it has no truth value. 
*Further reading again suggests that one could establish a Convention H which has hierarchical levels of "heterological" in which the word can only apply to objects on a different level. 

This resolution is not necessarily Tarski's: The Definability paradox conflates two levels of what we mean by definition. Quite reasonably we would expect the positive integers which are described in 100 words or less to be described in a way altogether different from the description given by "the smallest integer that requires more than 100 words to define it." Being imprecise about what we mean by "definition" is what makes the paradox permissible. 

(*This discussion is somewhat muddled*)

8] What is Kripke's objection to the Tarski's solution to the Liar's paradox? 

Tarski claims that natural languages are inconsistent because they can be self-referential, but Kripke claims that there are some self-referential phrases or pairs of phrases that are perfectly comprehensible in English. Cuonzo gives the following example

Imagine that a reporter says of the disgraced and imprisoned Bernard Madoff, "All of Madoff's claims about his investment company are false," and Madoff responds, "Everything that reporter said about my investment company is false." By Tarski's account, there is something wrong with both statements, because each violates the metalanguage/object language distinction. Yet as Kripke claims, we often not only understand such claims but can assign truth values to them.

 We can clearly state that the reporter is telling the truth and that Madoff is lying, and there is no inconsistency present even though the sentence is self-referential. 

9] What is a natural language? What is a formal language? Examples? 

A natural language is a language which evolved conventions through its use and extension by people. All spoken languages (that I know of) are natural languages. A formal language consists of a set of strings and symbols and a set of rules for manipulating them. Programming languages are formal languages. 

Tarski's definitions of truth are said to apply to formal languages and not natural languages. 

2.7 Solution type 6: Accepting the Paradox

1] What is the Dollar Cost Auction? How does it lead to a seemingly contradictory result? What is Constanza's rational solution? 

The Dollar Cost Auction is described as follows: Say that two players are each given $2.50 and are allowed to bid on $1 in an auction sale. The dollar will go to the highest bidder regardless of how high or how low the bid is. However, the second highest bidder will be required to relinquish his or her bid and will receive nothing in return. The game allows sequential bids in increments of 5 cents. What is the optimal strategy? 

If cooperation were allowed, the best strategy would be for one player to bid 5 cents, for the other player to bid nothing and for the two players to split the 95 cents surplus. 

If cooperation were not allowed, then the best strategy for each player would be to attempt to outbid the other player in increments of $0.05 cents. That is player 1 bids $0.05  so he could claim the dollar, then player 2 would bid $0.10 cents to beat the first bid, and then player 1 would bid $0.15 cents to beat the second bid and so on. Each player, would continue raising the bid in an attempt to win money as the game continues up until the second player reaches the $1.00 mark. After wards, the first player would bet $1.10 even though such a bet would place him at a $0.10 loss because such a loss is preferable to the $0.95 he would have faced if he had bet nothing. From here on each player continues to raise the stakes of the bid in an attempt to lose the least amount of money. The game continues until one player exhausts his funds. In one ending situation one player leaves with a $1.50 loss and the other player with a $2.50 loss. This end result coupled with the reasonable steps that led to it is what is contradictory: both players in effect lose the global game by employing perfectly rational local strategies. 

Costanza's rational solution is that neither player should have started to play the game at all. 

2] What is Dummet's "Motion paradox"? What is the resolution? Why are some of the descriptions of the paradox intrinsically inconsistent?

Dummet's Motion paradox is described as follows (on pg 125 of Paradox)

I look at something which is moving, but moving too slowly for me to be able to see that [it] is moving. After one second, it still looks to me as though it was in the same position; similarly after three seconds. After four seconds, however, I can recognize that it has moved from where it was at the start, i.e., four seconds ago. At this time, however, it does not look to me as though it is in a different position from that which it was in one, or even three seconds before. How is it possible for the object to move while not be moving? 

The paradox comes from being unable to perceive local changes while recognizing the existence of global changes above some scale. A realistic example is the melting of glaciers which occurs so slowly that it is impossible to see with the naked eye, but because evident over the course of months. 

I think the resolution comes from noting that the paradox has a built in inconsistency through its implicit reference to an absolute "origin of time." The fact that there is no t=0 point in time from which all other times are measured means that any point in time can be taken as starting point for our observation. Thus we could try to envision  a scenario where an object has not appeared to move as we wait a time t1 to t1+3, but has indeed appeared to move by t1+4. However, such a scenario contradicts a shifted origin in which we start observing the object at t1+1 and have seen that it has moved only by t1+5. 

Here's another way to describe this resolution: The object being at position x1 at times t1+1, t1+2, and t1+3, and only shifting to position x1+d at t1+4, contradicts the object being at position x1 at times t1+2, t1+3, and t1+4 and only shifting to position x1+d at t1+5. Either scenario is possible, because if the object is truly moving too slowly to perceive any difference in its motion, beginning at t1+1 should be as good as beginning at t1+2. However, the assumption of the prompt makes the beginning time crucial to the observation of a difference in position. Thus the prompt is inconsistent. 


2.8 Which Solution types to Use and When

1] What is a folk concept? What does Cuonzo see as a main source of paradoxes?

Folk concepts are ideas such as baldness, truth, and beauty which have informal definitions and meanings and thus admit paradoxes due to their lack of precision. Cuonzo sees these folk concepts as the main source of paradoxes. 

February 20, 2018 --- Tuesday 10:43 AM
Understanding Stereotype and Prejudice

I recently listened to an episode of the podcast "Code Switch" which discussed the various ways people incorrectly use the word racism. A speaker in the podcast (whose name I can't remember) provided a very good outline of the terms that people misuses and what the correct definitions of those terms are. Here is a summary of his outline 

Stereotype: Associating a behavior or set of traits with a particular group. 
"Black people are good at basketball, but bad at math."

Prejudice: Having negative attitudes about particular group of people for whatever reasons
"I don't trust people from the Middle East"

Bigotry: Prejudice + stereotype; Having negative attitudes about a particular group of people due to behavior you think is associated with them

Discrimination: Actions taken on the basis of prejudice
"No Blacks allowed"

X-ism: A pattern of behavior (at the institutional, interpersonal, cultural level) that uses differences in power to make discrimination an operating principle of a society.

Can occur at multiple levels

"Reverse Prejudice" exists and perhaps even "Reverse Bigotry" but "Reverse Racism" against white people has never existed in America because people in power have never codified into law bigotry against white people.

Hi Phys 101 Students

By now the class has gone over many standard derivations in physics and mathematics. 

Hi Phys 101 students, 

By this point, the class has gone over many derivations in physics and mathematics. Efficiently learning all of these derivations can be difficult because it is not always clear the details to which one should pay attention. To that end I've written notes on best practices for working through a derivation not only so that the derivation is understood, but also so that it can be used to extend a theory in new directions. These best practices essentially boil down to interrogating the larger question that frames the derivation in addition to the standard practice of asking "why?" about the derivation's specific steps. Many of you engage in these practices anyway, but the notes explain why such practices are good even beyond this class.

Question 1: Describe your previous experience in science communication and how that experience is innovative, unique, or impactful.
Describe one or more science communication efforts you've been involved in, and what you believe may be particularly impactful or innovative about those efforts. These could include participation or leadership in student organizations, contributions to science outreach programs, blogging or other writing for the general public, activity on social media, or other experiences. Try to focus on activities outside of your regular duties as a graduate student. 
Write no more than 750 characters (includes spaces).

Last summer I taught physics to high school students. Teaching a physics course may not typically be considered "science communication" proper, but the course was originally geared toward sophomores at MIT and yet was being taught to incoming high school seniors from across the U.S.. Consequently, many of the practices of science communication (i.e., using analogies, qualitative arguments in lieu of technical details) were needed in order to impart the essence of the subject without extensive mathematics. Moreover, I tried to communicate the peripheral aspects of scientific inquiry in physics outside of the subject matter itself, namely what physics' intimate relationship with mathematics suggests about how the subject should be learned. 


------------------------------------
Question 2: Please describe your research as you would to the general public.
Imagine you are asked about your research by a member of the general public. Please give an example of how you would describe the work that you do in an accurate, but exciting and engaging way. 
Write no more than 500 characters (includes spaces).

Imagine you're in a dance hall filled with 100 dancing people. Each person entered the hall as part of a specific couple and would prefer to dance with the person he or she entered with but is also willing to dance with anyone else. Each person can also dance alone, although he or she would prefer to dance in any couple. This system of dancing people is statistically similar to a system of biomolecules which can exist alone or together according to probabilities defined by their binding energies. 

I study the thermodynamics of systems containing large numbers of proteins and strands of DNA that interact according to their binding energies. We can study such systems by considering a dance hall filled with many dancing people who can dance alone but would prefer to dance in a couple and would prefer even more to dance with one other specific person. The statistical physics of this "dance hall" system can be analyzed exactly and can then be used as a model of how biomolecules interact. 

------------------------------------
Question 3: How will attending ComSciCon help further your goals as a science communicator?
For example, consider one or more of the following questions: Are there new efforts you are hoping to launch or get engaged in through the connections you would make at ComSciCon? How would attending help or influence your ongoing projects and your future career? How would you bring the things you learned at ComSciCon back to your home institution? 
Write no more than 500 characters (includes spaces).

I hope ComSciCon will allow me to participate in science workshops and meet science communicators that provide unique insights and ways to communicate science to an interested public. 

I hope that ComSciCon will give me new perspectives on how to communicate science to an interested public, and also on how to manage such communication while remaining a research scientist. Attending the conference, and meeting various science communicators would also give me a better sense of the spectrum of non-academic science careers available to any other students I advise in the future.

One intriguing quality of intracellular processes is the ability of biomolecules to bind together in specific interactions while existing in a sea of other biomolecules that could lead to spurious interactions. 


 We do so by considering various combinatorial models of interacting biomolecular dimers. 

For the purposes of solubility, we focus our attention on dimers and analyze the way combinatorics constrains the conditions under which gendered and non-gendered biomolecules match up with their correct partners.

 This distinguishing exists within a sea of many other biomolecules. 

Combinatorics 

Hi Jacob, 

From my office hours this week I have two sets of comments: One on the solution set and the other on the students. 

Comments about the solution set: 

HW#5 2(a): For the simple harmonic oscillator as it is discussed in the notes, the potential energy near a stable equilibrium q_eq is given by
This potential energy is the most general form for motion near a stable equilibrium. The problem asks us to take q_eq =0 which reduces this potential energy to 
However, there seems to be no good reason to eliminate the V(0) term, especially given the subsequent parts of the problem. (Such a constant term is typically rendered irrelevant by conservation of energy since it would appear on both sides of the equality, but this problem does not involve conservation of energy.)

Using the above potential energy in the subsequent parts of the problem (and assuming only the energy is discretized) we find the solution
which suggests that it is perfectly possible for the harmonic oscillator under Bohr-Sommerfield quantization to have an offset energy. What are your thoughts on this derivation, or on the possible motivation for excluding the V(0) term when we're considered general potential energies?

HW#5 4(d): The yo-yo begins to slip when the condition
(modulo a sign) is no longer true. And the condition cos(theta) = r/R gives the angle at which the yo-yo does not roll and does not translate (i.e., where a = alpha R = 0). But why is cos(theta) = r/R also the angle at which the yo-yo begins to slip? My own explanation is that when a = 0 we have a situation where the yo-yo is barely touching the surface and is thus spinning (i.e., with non-zero alpha) without translating (i.e., with zero a), or when alpha =0 the yo-yo is translating (i.e., with non-zero a) without spinning (i.e., with zero alpha), but this explanation is not terribly satisfying to me. 

Another way to phrase this question: Why is a=0 the point at which the no slipping condition is violated?
I am interested in an explanation for my own edification, but I think the solution set should include an explanation as well. 

Comments about students 
Questions of Purpose: A lot of students had questions concerning the "Why?" or the purpose of the assignment problems. For example, the purpose of the Bohr-Sommerfield* question was particularly unclear for some of the students. As were the purposes of the perturbation theory and wedge product questions from a few assignments ago. Many of them felt they were doing mathematical manipulations but at the end of the problem it wasn't clear to them why these manipulations were not arbitrary and what larger purpose they were directed towards.

Questions of Meaning: Related to the question of purpose, some students had questions about meaning. The mechanics problems were easy to interpret, but at least two students asked what was the physical meaning of the spatial integral of momentum* in Problem 2. My guess is these questions will remain and expand as the course continues. 

*For the questions about Bohr-Sommerfield problem I said the meaning boiled down to taking the integral and quantization condition as a principle of "old quantum theory" and the purpose was to show that one can derive the quantized energy levels of the harmonic oscillator this way (I directed the students to the wikipedia page for the quantum oscillator). 


Best,
Mobolaji

Edits for "Missing Curriculum in Physics Problem Solving Education"


From Second Reviewer: Article is interesting but doesn't seem to be saying anything new about problem solving. Article is also missing some important references from the general problem solving literature. Some examples of references you can use. 
Training for unknown by means of known: Bowden, J. and Marton, F. The University of Learning: Beyond quality and competence in university education
General overview of problem-solving literature in physics and in general: Hsu, L., et. al., (2004) Resource letter RPS-1. Research in problem solving. American Journal of Physics, 63(1), 17-32. 
Context Rich Problems: (Relevant to your "let students construct the problem given a situation" questions)
Jeopardy Problems: (Similarly relevant to your "Let students construct the problem")
Problem Posing: (Similar to your "let students suggest a different problem" question)
For overview of research in learning problem-solving in physics: Reif, F. (1995) Millikan Lecture 1994: Understanding and teaching important scientific thought processes. 
For solving context rich problems: Ogilvie, C. (2009). Changes in students' problem-solving strategies in a course that includes context-rich, multifaceted problems.  
From Third Reviewer: The article is not a research essay and requires extensive changes as a consequence. (Why is it not a research essay? Perhaps because it doesn't make sufficient reference to an existing body of literature.)
Line 31: Reviewer sees Notre Dame Physics as mischaracterizing "liberal arts". This section needs to engage more substantially with where physics fits in today's conceptualization of science. 
This could be possible with more than a single reference of how physics is useful/used in science.

Why do physics where does it lead https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/IISME/article/view/6325 
39: The claim that physics majors must market themselves is consistent with reviewers experience, but it is suggested that I use and make reference to undergraduate advising literature in order to substantiate my claims. 
Adapting to a Changing World---Challenges and Opportunities in Undergraduate Physics Education: http://biblioteca.ucv.cl/site/colecciones/manuales_u/18312.pdf 
46: I state "it is not clear that such a specific type of problem-solving knowledge is at all transferrable to less artificial contexts outside or even inside academia." The review says this strong assertion requires support from existing literature
You should change the word "transferable" to "relevant". 
I know of some studies about graduate education suggesting the type of students who succeed and don't succeed. I think it's by someone whose last name is Lovitts. 
The reviewer suggests I look into "the transfer of learning" problem in the education research. 
Some of the studies listed above might be helpful. 
62: The reviewer claims that this argument should be retoned to be seen as personal account, or I should cite some memoirs to bolster my claims. I think citing memoirs (presuming I could find them) would be preferable since the personal nature of the account is revealed in the following paragraph. 
Where would I find such memoirs? Practically, any one who is writing a memoir in science is doing so because he or she is famous in science, and is often so famous because they found much of their beginning research work easy to contend with. 
Emanuel Derman is an exception to this. Who else? 
84: The reviewer disagrees with the claim that physics courses are not supposed to prepare students for research. 
I think here it will be necessary to be precise by what I mean when I say "prepare". Yes, a course in electrodynamics will teach you the what an electric field is and how to calculate it for various simple charge distributions (and this moniker of simple is used independently of how complicated the resulting calculation is), but such skills are not all of what is necessary in actively contending with the initial steps of confusion in an electrodynamics research problem. [I know what you're saying but this isn't particularly convincing.]
116-126: Reviewer says that my experience differs radically from his or hers. He or she did very well in their physics work straight from undergrad. 
Instead of using anecdotes, I should look at research on student outcomes. 
147-149: Textbook citations are strange. You should state the titles and you should explain why these textbooks are chosen as examples. 
Problems Solving: Inside and Outside the Classroom - There is (supposedly) a vast literature on scientific practice. The reviewer suggests I make contact with it in order to better describe how scientists solve problems. 
Discussion of Poorly Defined Problems - There is apparently a literature on poorly defined problems I should make contact with. Or at least I should look for such a literature. 
188-209: Where does this set up of problem solving come from? 
I need to make sure I explain that it is a wider framework for understanding problem solving and that it is justified by the later examples. [I do explain this somewhat in the relevant paragraph]
420: The reviewer has the interesting idea that this section should be about assessment. Namely, that physics courses and problem solving reforms are assessing the wrong things for students and thus courses are geared towards teaching them limited and sort of artificial skills.  
477: The reviewer states that "it is no longer adequate to pose curricular and pedagogical ideas without deeper rationale," meaning I shouldn't just state the new types of problems I think will improve physics education but I should cite reasons (grounded in the literature) for why these problems are better. 
Commenting on the ability to abstract a toy model from a more complex problem as a necessary one for all scientists is also probably a good tack. 
The author suggests I look at Kaiser's work: Pedagogy and the Practice of Science. 
The article "Changes in students' problem-solving strategies in a course that includes context-rich, multifaceted problems." may also be a useful justification. 

Action Items
Correct Textbook titles and justify their choices

 

"Is your research experience typical?" Maybe search for: Do people typically struggle with research when they enter graduate school? Why do they struggle? (Lovitts' work would be useful in this regard)

"Is your industry experience typical?" Maybe look at data on how employers view undergraduate physics majors and what these undergraduate physics students feel they are prepared for. 

Need to better justify your problem framework. You can perhaps use examples of scientists solving problems, or the reviewer suggests I make contact with specifically historical literature on scientific practice. 
Bransford and Stein presented a similar problem-solving process in XXX. Called the IDEAL model, it considers problem solving to consist of (a) Identifying the problem, (b) Defining and representing the problem, (c) Exploring strategies for solving, (d) Acting on the strategies, and (e) Looking back and evaluate your results. Thus Bransford and Stein's scheme is similar to that in XXXX. However, the scheme proposed in (FIGURE REFERENCE) differs from the IDEAL scheme (and most other characterizations of the problem-solving process) in that it incorporates the intellectual state which precedes the identification or definition of a problem. Ever before a problem is recognized to even exist, there is a state of confusion or incompleteness which is only acknowledged and responded to upon the decision to define a problem framework. It is these dual steps of  recognizing and then articulating one's initial state of confusion as an appropriate problem framework which are rarely considered in most characterizations of the problem-solving process.  The scheme in (FIG REFERENCE) consolidates steps (a) and (b) of IDEAL problem-solving into "formulating a problem framework" and the steps (c), (d), and (e) into "searching for a solution". Hidentifying an inconsistency or need" existing prior to both stages.
Look for literature on ill conditioned problems; I cannot remember the section this would be relevant to 
David Forstus: "The importance of learning to make assumptions" Forstus, by studying the way BA physics graduates solved three well-defined physics problems and one real-world problem, attempted to answer the following questions: "Does skill at solving well-defined problems in Newtonian Mechanics imply skill at solving a real-world problem in the same domain, and in what ways do strategies for solving the former differ from strategies for the latter?" 
Quote: "The goal of K-12 physics education is not to prepare students to be able to solve the sterile kinds of problems typically found in most textbooks. If talented high school graduates are not able to deal with problems that involve the need to make assumptions, which is typical of many real-world situations, something is amiss with the education they received."
The real-world problem was defined as such because it was not couched in the standard technical language of physics and instead used colloquial every day language. 
Forstus sees making assumptions as the principal difference between well-defined and ill-defined problems, and that while the ability to solve ill-defined problems suggests the ability to solve well-defined problems the converse is not true. 
Consequently he suggests, as have many others (Mazur, WISE design for knowledge integration, Reif and Heller, Shin and Jonassen and McGee), ill-defined problems should be incorporated into problem solving curriculum. In this article, I am arguing for something more expansive: Not merely the incorporation of ill-defined problems into a curriculum, but incorporating contexts in which students have to decide on the problems for themselves. 
Schoenfield distinction between problems and exercises:  A problem is a task that is difficult (in a non-algorithmic way) for the individual who is trying to solve it. An exercise can be solved straight away using a well-practiced procedure, even if that procedure is technical and long. Calculating loop diagrams is an exercise of quantum field theory. 
In a study concerning problem solving strategies for astronomy students, (Predictors of Well-Structured and Ill-Structured Problem Solving in an Astronomy Simulation), Shi, Jonassen, and McGee noted that ill-structured problems relied on case-based reasoning and applying previous experiences (Jonassen), and thus students without those experiences found ill-structured problems too ambiguously defined to be soluble. Moreover, for unfamiliar contexts, such ill-strcutured problems greatly required students to plan and monitor their progress, metacognitive strategies not typically applied for problems with less open solutions. 
Milbourne similarly found (Self-Regulation in the Midst of Complexity: A Case Study of High School Physics Students Engaged in Ill-Structured Problem Solving
) found that integrating content knowledge and self-regulattaroy were both needed by advanced high school students in tackling ill-structured problems in the context of research. 


a similar one suggested by Bransford and Stein There is an intellectual state which precedes the identification of a problem and this state




Talk about assessment in the section "Reasons for the missing curriculum." Review mentions constructive alignment which revolves around testing students according to what we want to teach (rather than teaching them according to what we will test). Assignments about preparing students for tests, so if you have a problem with the assignments you perhaps have a deeper problem with the tests themselves. 
Chapter 7 of the Learning University has interesting points on the constructive alignment problem.

The Revival of Lamarckian Evolution
I'm currently reading Salvador Luria's autobiography The Slot Machine and the Broken Test Tube, and I am gradually working through an understanding of the experimental work he did with Delbruck which eventually made both of them famous. Quite strangely I apparently understood the experiments to some extent because I have a six year old Mathematica file where I simulated some of the essential ideas behind the experiment. But I now have no recollection of ever having done that problem! Such is the standard casualty of the fire hose of MIT's education. 

Anyway, I was listening to a RadioLab podcast today which discussed the history of the CRISPR-Cas9 genetic editing tool, and one important event in that history was the discovery of virus DNA in bacteria. The standard explanation for why such DNA exists in bacteria is that long ago some ancestral bacterium survived a virus attack and incorporated the DNA of the virus into its own genome so that it could be recognized later one. This explanation was interesting to me because it seemed to contradict the Darwinian hypothesis established by the Luria-Delbrück experiments. The experiments seemed to show that if you have a bunch of bacteria and then you put a virus into the midst of that bacteria, the surviving bacteria would not be the ones which have immediately evolved a defense mechanism to said bacteria (the so called "Lamarckian Hypothesis"), but rather the daughter bacteria of other bacteria that generations ago acquired mutations which are now favored in this new environment (the so called "Darwinian Hypothesis"). Luria and Delbrück won Nobel Prizes for this work, and yet the mechanism they postulated does not seem to be the universal way bacteria develop resistance to viruses. [I've checked this online and it seems that the microbiology community does accept that the CRISPR genes do support the Lamarckian hypothesis.] 

At another point Luria states that he (or people he worked with) were responsible for understanding the way bacteriophages infected bacteria. But I read in Root-Bernstein's discussion of Alexander Fleming's discovery of lysozyme that this was already well known when Fleming was doing his experiments in the early 1920s (decades before Luria had even started studying bacteriophages). 

[I've done some reading. Apparently there was contentious evidence for the existence of bacteriophages before Luria and Delbrück's work, but a that time scientists did not know how viruses killed bacteria or even that bacteria had genes and chromosomes. It was not until the work of Luria and Delbrück that both the replication mechanism of viruses and the genetic structure of bacteria was known.]

Notes on "The Origins of Dalton's Atomic Theory" by Leonard Nash

The objective of these notes is to understand Dalton's conflicting accounts of his atomic theory and to see if these conflicts arose because he was interpreting his previous work in terms of what he ultimately understood about his work. 

First what is Dalton's Atomic Theory? A list which is akin to Dalton's original formulation is as follows: 
1 Matter consists of elements which themselves consist of extremely small particles called atoms. 
2 Atoms of a given element are identical in size, mass, and other properties. Atoms of different elements are different in size, mass, and other properties.
3 Atoms cannot be subdivided, created, or destroyed. 
4 Atoms of different elements combine in simple whole number ratios to make compounds
5 In chemical reactions, atoms are combined, separated, or rearranged. 

Nash (1956) Comments that Dalton gave three mutually contradictory accounts of the origin of his theory and none of these accounts were consistent with information available from other sources. 
	- All of these accounts seemed to concern not the development of the origin of Dalton's theory in its entirety, but specifically the development of his axiom that atoms of different elements combine in simple whole number ratios. (This axiom is called the law of multiple proportions)

In one account Dalton claims to have arrived at the law of multiple proportions through his analysis of methane and ethylene. However, Dalton's notebooks reveal that he performed these analyses about a year after he first published his work based on that very law of multiple proportions. 

After the development of his theory, Dalton told a colleague (William Henry) that the atomic chemical theory came to him while he was trying to understand an experimental table published by the German chemist Jeremias Richter. However, there is no reference to Richter's work in Dalton's own notebooks and Dalton's own published table did not contain the acids and and bases which were the focal point of Richter's work. 

Finally, in an account published about seven years after the first glimpses of theory were published, Dalton gave a lecture at the royal institution of science where he claimed that the theory arose in 1805 when he was contemplating how gases consisting of different elements diffused past one another, and how such diffusion could depend on the sizes of the particles making up the elements. Later review of Dalton's letters affirm that he was indeed thinking of gases at this time (i.e., 1805). However the beginnings of Dalton's atomic theory are dated for September 1803, a full two years before he was contemplating the properties of the mixed gases which purportedly led to the atomic theory.

Ultimately Nash argues that the true origin of Dalton's atomic theory were his investigations of the solubility of different gases in water, and Dalton developed the atomic theory directly as an attempt to study this problem, rather than prior to and independently of this problem. 

It does not seem the Dalton was trying to be intentionally misleading in all of these accounts. Rather it appears he was interpreting his initial investigations retrospectively and reasoning backwards to how such investigations could have led to the more general and inclusive theory he ultimately found. Throughout all the prior work described in his conflicting stories, it is clear that Dalton was working to solve some problem, but the exact problem (determining how atoms to form compounds) did not seem to be clear to him until he hit upon the insight that atoms form in whole number ratios, that is, until he found a solution which allowed for a clearer interpretation of all his previous results.

Research Experience Drafts for "Missing Curriculum in Physics Problem Solving Education"


My first project concerned R-axions in multiple supersymmetry breaking. I had not known enough supersymmetry to be able to begin the project proper so it was suggested that I first work on a toy problem. In the R-axion problem, my task was to investigate the phenomenology of R-axions in theories where supersymmetry is broken multiple times. The idea was that such theories could serve as playgrounds in which to study models of dark matter. 

It thus concerned a somewhat niche area of high-energy particle theory, 

Supersymmetry. Physicists say that supersymmetry is a "broken" symmetry because although one can construct supersymmetry although it may be mathematically true of our world (and increasing evidence shows that it is not), it is not physically manifest. 

Supersymmetry is a postulated symmetry of nature which states that for every boson (fermion) in the universe there is a fermion (boson) with the same mass and interaction properties . Physicists say that the symmetry of a theory is "broken" when the dynamical equations of the theory satisfy the symmetry, but the solutions to those equations (i.e., the physical observations) do not. Therefore, if our world is indeed supersymmetric—meaning that it is invariant under appropriate exchanges of bosons and fermions—supersymmetry must be broken at every-day energy scales because it is clear that the world around us is not manifestly supersymmetric. Theories of broken supersymmetry can include a particle called the "R-axion" (provided other symmetries are broken in the theory), and R-axions were once predicted to be light enough to be seen at the LHC. It should be noted that supersymmetry is a conjectured symmetry and has not been physically observed. 


When physicists say that "supersymmetry" must be a "broken" symmetry they are saying that the dynamical equations of particle interactions can satisfy supersymmetry even though our observations of the world reveal that supersymmetry is not manifest in the solutions to those equations. (Weirdly worded)

 it is broken 

For my very first research project, I was tasked with investigating the physical consequences of a supersymmetric theory containing hypothetical particles called R-axions. Supersymmetry is a symmetry 

In much the same that the magnitude of a vector is unchanged upon rotation, a supersymmetric theory of bosons and fermions is unchanged upon appropriate exchanges of the bosons and fermions. 

R-axions are

Usually for a new research student, the most surprising aspect of a first research project is how unstructured it is, the shear degree of fumbling and meandering you have to go through before you can merely define the question you're trying to answer. False expectations concerning the nature of this inherently ill-defined process are the primary sources of frustration for many beginning researchers. 

I was no exception. My first research project concerned R-axions in theories of multiple supersymmetry breaking, a somewhat niche area of high energy theoretical physics (The details of the work are not crucial, but see footnote XXX for a short description of a R-axions, supersymmetry, and supersymmetry breaking). The task was to investigate the physical properties of such theories and to determine the masses and ultimately the experimental signatures of the associated particles. However, multiple supersymmetry breaking was a fairly new topic, and I did not have the requisite background in supersymmetry to even begin the project. Therefore, as a first step, my advisor suggested I work on a toy model of the problem which only required quantum field theory. 

Unfortunately, even this toy model proved intractable. During the first months I worked on the problem,  I would begin and end my work sessions in confusion. I knew quantum field theory and had previously spent many hours computing decay rates, cross sections, and loop diagrams, but in studying this toy model it was not clear how or where such techniques could be useful. It was not even clear to me what questions I could generate in this toy model which could serve as reasonable analogs to the questions I solved in the standard quantum field theory texts, or even whether these questions were the ones I needed to answer in order to develop a framework which could be extended to the supersymmetric case.

Having been culled on well-defined problems whose solutions were tacitly carved into the problem statement itself, I was unprepared for a situation in which I had to do a large amount of unstructured thinking on my own in order to both define my own problems and check whether these problems moved me closer toward a larger objective.

In the end I was able to determine the masses of the particles in the toy model—a success which was just small part of a much larger investigation which was never completed—but what allowed me to make what little progress I did was an abandonment of the habits which were so instilled from traditional education. I had to learn to engage in a problem solving process much deeper than the one to which I was accustomed and learn how to ask myself questions when confused and explore a subject area beyond the confines of my central question.

I had not even yet reached the point where interaction properties could be inferred from the equations of the theory. 

did not even seem Each night, I would go to sleep believing I had failed for the day because I was apparently no closer to a solution to this toy problem than I was when I had started. 

At the start of my sophomore year in college, I began my first research project. The technical details of the project are not of specific importance, so I will just highlight the general structure. The research problem was in a rather obscure area of particle physics and dealt with an extension to a research paper my adviser had completed the year prior. The formal project was to work on this extension, but because I didn't have the requisite background to fully understand the problem, my advisor suggested I work on a toy model of the problem while I was learning the prerequisites for the main problem. 
Unfortunately this toy problem also proved to be rather difficult. During that first semester, I worked on the problem on and off during week nights after I completed my regular course work. The work session would usually begin and end in confusion, and in between would consist of flailing attempts to find some way to make progress. Consequently, most nights during that semester I would go to sleep thinking that I had failed for the day because I was apparently no closer to a solution to this toy problem than I was when I had started. 
These bouts of frustration were particularly unnerving because they were both atypical in degree and kind. Of course I had before felt the irritating sense of confusion which comes from not being able to make progress on a textbook problem or homework assignment, but these feelings were often short term, confined to a week of less, and were more psychologically manageable because I knew that an answer must exist for these tasks. On the other hand, the frustration incurred during this first research project, last for months and I 

there must be some answer or way out of my confusion. On the other hand the frustration I felt during this first research project lasted months and there was no indication that anything would or could resolve it. 
Moreover I had been deluded by a false sense of confidence built up from years working through physics textbooks. The problems in those textbooks sometimes took many collective hours of work to figure out, but rarely did they ever require you to attempt to define as well as solve a problem. Even for the problems which one could consider to be 'partially defined', there was still ample enough contextual discussion that the remaining problem definition could be easily filled in. In none of these problems was their any question as to the availability of an answer. The answer was there and you simply had to find it. 

As a result, I was quite psychologically and tactically unprepared to meet the working challenges of a first research project in which the I had to not only solve but define the problem for myself. This is of course a retrospective analysis. 


At the time, as I was struggling to make sense of the research problem, I felt that the fault lay not in my skills but in my intellect. I never considered whether my prior preparation and experience in problem solving had cultivated habits of analysis which would make transitioning to the ill defined practice of research especially difficult.

Notes from "What did mathematics do to physics?" by Yves Gringas

Gringas has many arguments. I'll mention two salient ones. 

He states that mathematics made the access to physics research difficult and time consuming, and ultimately led to the institutionalization of physics in ways that isolated previous amateur practitioners. The time frame over which this mathematization occurred and began to affect physics was from the early 1800s until its near completion in the late 1800s. In this sense Faraday was an anomaly in the group of prominent electromagnetism researchers in that his work was primarily qualitative. In 1857, after Maxwell sent his paper "On Faraday's lines of forces" to the eponymous natural philosopher (Gringas's phrase), Faraday mentioned being intimidated by the mathematics and later wrote 

There is one thing I would be glad to ask you. When a mathematician engaged in investigating physical actions and results has arrived at his conclusions, may they not be expressed in common language as fully, clearly, and definitely as in mathematical formulae? (The scientific letters and papers of James Clerk Maxwell (Cambridge, 1990), 548)

thus imploring Maxwell to provide qualitative explanation for his mathematical work. However, the field was already moving in a different direction. As Gingras states (pg. 397)

…over a period of nearly two centuries, the progressive mathematization of various domains of physics had the effect of excluding as legitimate practitioners most of the readers (and sometimes contributors) of the scientific and literary magazines who used to talk about natural phenomena without using the language of mathematics. 

This makes me wonder if something similar is occurring in high energy theoretical physics today. Many physicists outside the discipline (author included) have reacted negatively to the abstraction and heavy emphasis on mathematics in high energy theory. There are good reasons for this reaction. For example, Sabine Hossenfelder claims that the high energy theorists interest in beauty is not a useful constraining principle because it is highly subjective and there is no rational reason why the physical laws of the universe must be consistent with human ideals of beauty. 

But one could claim these reasons are beside the point and don't really respond to the value that the high energy theory community sees in their work. Faraday stated that "mathematics cannot of itself introduce the knowledge of any new principle" ("On the conservation of force", Philosophical magazine, 4th ser., xiii, no. 86, April 1857, 225-39) and although this is true, taking it as a categorical rebuke of using mathematics in physics would be a mistake because it would suggest the only thing of value in physics is introducing new physical principles. Rather, mathematics has shown its utility in its ability to deduce interesting consequences of principles which are not manifest in bare statements of the principles themselves. Perhaps a similar argument can be made for the theoretical apparatus of high energy theory and the aesthetic justifications physicists in these fields make for their work. "Your work is not based on reality and is driven by concerns for beauty which are not objective, universal, nor shown to be useful constraining principles of true models," says one physicist. "True, but with my work I am able to understand in new ways the models which are true to reality," responds the high energy theorist. In a sense, what we are experiencing is the development of a new field of physics, one which exists between theoretical physics and mathematical physics, and which is neither concerned with modeling reality or imbuing physical laws with mathematical rigor. Rather this new field is concerned with exploring the mathematical consequences (regardless of their reality) of the frameworks and laws established by theorists. 

Perhaps the deeper lesson here is that all scientific communities are value-based in the sense that what is considered legitimate scientific work is grounded in values which cannot be said to be rational. The values of scientific communities can change over time so that work during one decade may appear to be responding to a focal question in the field, while the same work during another decade may appear to be tangential to the principal concerns of the field. I should emphasize that this is different from Kuhn's notion of incommensurable paradigms. Various works can exist within the same paradigm and yet have differing worth according to how well they align with the values of the field. 

A second thing mathematics did to physics was to change what it meant to "explain" a phenomena. Gingras states this change became prominent in the debate over Newton's "explanation" of gravity. Newton provided a mathematical account of gravitational forces but many authors criticized him for not providing what they saw as a necessary "physical explanation" of what gave rise to gravity. Many authors saw mathematics as distinct from physics and that although the former could be worked through with logical proof, the latter required more verbal account grounded in ideas. On the reactions to Newton's work, Gingras writes (pg. 398)

This episode shows that the evaluation criteria for what was to count as an acceptable 'explanation' (of gravitation in this case) were shifting towards mathematics and away from mechanical explanations. Confronted with a mathematical formulation of a phenomenon for which there was no mechanical explanation, more and more actors chose the former even at the price of not finding the latter. This was something new. For the whole of the seventeenth century and most of the eighteenth, to 'explain' a physical phenomena meant to give the physical mechanism involved in its production. Hence Descartes could still reject Galileo's law of free fall because it was not based on a mechanical explanation of gravity. 

All of this is very interesting to me. I am constantly debating the utility of my work beyond the time and place in the scientific community in which I find myself. It seems that this debate is even more fraught than I thought it was because the scientific community is governed by values both explicit and implicit all of which are more inductive guesses of what works and is important rather than more concretely justified principles of practice. To a certain extent, all we have are these inductive guesses in deciding what a science is or should be, but I wonder if I should allow (or can even prevent from allowing) my work to be judged according to "inductive guesses of what is valuable" made by other people.

Modeling the skills
I am seeking to justify: 

Confining our examples to scientists may appear to be an unnecessary limitation, but if the problem-solving education of science students has any universal value, it is primarily a value in the direction of simulating the knowledge and techniques actual scientists use to solve problems. 

So why is this? I had previously thought the reason was obvious, but of course I am a scientist and the skills that science students are building (or the skills I think they should be building) are consonant with my value system. Can I more precisely justify this value? Why shouldn't the value be in the direction of simulating the knowledge and techniques of engineers, bureaucrats, or doctors—all professions that many physics students eventually pursue.  

One argument extends from the purpose of a liberal arts education. Essentially, students are taught statistics from statisticians, mathematics from mathematicians, and history from historians not merely because the academic practitioners of a discipline often have the best grasp of the discipline and thus satisfy the necessary condition for being able to convey the relevant knowledge. But also because engaging with the discipline, either outside or inside academia, requires employing tacit skills and knowledge which only practitioners can model and eventually impart to students. 

Thus, the student of statistics learns not only how to compute linear regressions and correlations, but also of the manifold ways that statistical data, without an account of the underlying analysis, can mislead and thus be misused. The student of real analysis learns not merely the standard proof that differentiability implies continuity and the fact that the converse implication has no proof, but also of the unreliability of intuition and the larger necessity of justifying claims, both mathematical and not, with rigorous argument.

 The student of U.S. history only learns not only about America's mid-20th century excursions into foreign statecraft, but also that there is a larger context to existing cultural norms and political relationships, and that a country's modern conception of itself exists as just one point in one narrative that is still being lived and written.

All of these habits of thinking are the residual lessons students walk away with when they conclude their education, and exist as surely in physics as they do in other academic disciplines. 

—————
Miscellaneous

- Thus the student of calculus learns not only how to take derivatives of trigonometric functions, but also hopefully learns how instantaneous rates of change can more generally give precise definitions for all spatially, temporally, or otherwise varying systems in the world and also how to deconstruct quantitatively technical problems into manageable parts which are solved individually and threaded together to obtain a final solution. (This at least is the hope).  

- This imparting of tacit skills is the explicit purpose of a graduate apprenticeship in a subject but it also exists as an often unstated but nevertheless crucial purpose of undergraduate instruction in the subject. Although they are learned within the context of specific academic disciplines, all of these tacit skills are the residual lessons students walk away with when they conclude their education. 

- Thus, the student of statistics learns not only how to compute linear regressions and correlations, but also of the manifold ways that statistical data, without an account of the underlying analysis and a qualitative understanding of the systems to which it is applied, can mislead and thus be misused.

- The student of biology learns not only of the central dogma of biology, but also the way structure of biomolecules determines their function and that the organization principles of life have been finely tuned in a slowly losing battle against the 2nd law of thermodynamics. 

Confining our examples to scientists may appear to be an unnecessary limitation, but if the problem-solving education of science students has any universal value, it is primarily a value in the direction of simulating the knowledge and techniques actual scientists use to solve problems. For example, students are taught statistics from statisticians and mathematics from mathematicians, not merely because the academic practitioners of a discipline often have the best grasp of the discipline, but also because students engagement with the discipline, either outside or inside academia, requires employing tacit skills and knowledge which only practitioners can model and eventually impart to students.

Thus, the student of Statistics learns not only how to compute linear regressions and correlations, but also of the manifold ways that statistical data, without an account of the underlying analysis, can mislead and thus be misused. The student of Real Analysis learns not merely the standard proof that differentiability implies continuity and the fact that the converse implication has no proof, but also of the unreliability of intuition and the larger necessity of justifying claims, both mathematical and not, with rigorous argument.

Much in the same way that statistics, mathematics, and history courses simulate for students the best practices for engaging with data, quantitative arguments, and current events, physics courses simulate how best to analyze the underlying physical laws of a phenomena and—considering physics' role as a cultivator of problem solving ability—the best general practices for solving problems.

In 1900, Max Planck, in an attempt to explain the spectrum of the frequencies of light produced by a perfectly emitting heated body (i.e., a “black body”), gave an ad hoc derivation of what is now known as the "black-body radiation formula". Seeking to better justify this result through combinatorial methods that had been employed by Boltzmann, Planck re-derived the formula this time from the assumption that the total energy of the light consisted of integer multiples of h nu, where…in this assumption, historians recognize the beginnings of a theoretical quantum description of nature, but at the time Planck made no such recognition; the discrete energy assumption was introduced more out of an aesthetic desire for an improved derivation rather than out of any deeper physical insight, and thus Planck was reluctant to interpret physically the implications of his formalism.

frequency of light multiplied by what is now known as Planck's constant.  was statistical methods emplheuristic derivat posited that the energy  of light emitted at each frequency  was quantized in amounts given by  where  was the numerical quantity we now call Planck's constant (Mehra & Rechenberg, 1982) . From this postulate, Planck was able to provide a physically grounded derivation for the spectral density of a perfectly emitting thermal body, and thus obtain what is now known as the “blackbody radiation formula”. However, because his postulate of energy quantization was introduced more so out of pressing need to find semblance with experimental results than out of any deep physical insight, Planck was reluctant to interpret physically the implications of his formalism.

Stability Conditions
At last I have been able to compute the trace and determinant of the hessian matrix for the free energy of the non-gendered dimer model. Both quantities can be argued to be positive for <k> > 1, and hence for the physically interesting ranges of these parameters the steepest-descent derived equilibrium conditions are not only stable but represent good approximations to the true partition function. I had originally aimed at finishing this calculation by the beginning of March, so I have in fact taken twice as long as intended. My estimate would have been woefully optimistic even in the most ideal circumstances, but further complicating the problem were my endless series of algebraic mistakes. Difficult sticking points were the calculations of the equilibrium conditions in the first place, the calculation of partial_x^2 F and the proof that it was positive, and the calculation of the determinant of the hessian matrix. What propelled me forward was a recognition that in the history of physics much more difficult calculations had been completed in the past, and what kept me from totally lambasting myself for all the errors was the knowledge of Kepler who had painstakingly calculated the orbits of the planets and had made many errors himself. 

I must say this achievement feels great even though it mostly amounts to a more rigorous justification of what I had already known to be true. Although this work had taken me, proportionally, the longest to complete it will certainly be relegated to the appendix of the forthcoming paper and will be read by virtually no one. Such is the status of rigor in physics literature today. 

With this calculation done, the next steps are to return to the new equilibrium conditions and to try to tease from them the thermal conditions for "self-assembly". I am currently quite stuck in trying to achieve these thermal conditions, but I think plotting the solutions to the equilibrium conditions would be a good first step. Afterwards, I'll try to pin down the phase behavior, the characterization of Type-I and Type-II dimer systems, and then finally the properties and implications of dimer ellipse (presuming it exists). Maybe, I'll also calculate modifications to the ideal gas law.

Learning about Planck's derivation of his eponymous law
For the "Missing Curriculum Paper",  I'm reading various references in the history of quantum theory. One of these references is Thomas Kuhn's history of blackbody radiation and of Planck's derivation of the black body radiation formula. Apparently my informal knowledge of this history is quite wrong. I had previously thought Planck first derived his law by assuming that the energy of the electromagnetic field is quantized. In fact he made no such assumption and first derived the law phenomenologically by guessing an expression for partial^2S/partial U^2, integrating it twice to find S(U), differentiating with respect to U to obtain T, and then inverting to find U as a function of T. Planck only later introduced the postulate of energy quantization when he was seeking a more physical explanation of the formula he already obtained, an explanation better grounded in the statistical mechanical methods of the day. And even then he saw this postulate as a mathematical convenience rather than one which suggested something about physical reality. It was only Einstein who completely committed to the idea that Planck's postulate suggested something about the quantization of light. 

All of this is really quite fascinating. Physics students do not really learn the history of their subject unless they seek out this knowledge. And even then, colloquial presentations can give a false sense of the whether scientists of yesterday were working according to the assumptions we take for granted today. It requires a deeper dive into the detailed history of a scientist's work and thoughts in order to get an accurate sense of what he or she was doing and why.

Myths and Misconceptions about glasses
A glass is an amorphous solid distinct from a crystal in that the bonds of the molecules which make up the solid are not arranged in a regular pattern. For example, if we were to place the chairs in a classroom in a rectangular arrangement such that there was equal spacing between a chair and the chairs to its front, left, right, and back then this situation would be akin to how molecules are arranged in a crystalline solid. Conversely, if the chairs were placed randomly around the room, then there would not be equal spacing between a chair and its adjacent chairs, and this situation would be akin to an amorphous solid (i.e., a glass). 

Some people think of glasses as liquids that flow very slowly, and they take antique window panes as an example of glass's liquid-like properties given that such window panes are thicker at the bottom and hence the glass must have "flowed" under the force of gravity to become that way. In fact the glasses have non-uniform thickness due to their an inability to create perfectly flat disks in the production process, and after cutting the glass, the thicker side was purposefully installed on the bottom to improve stability and to keep water from accumulating at the bottom of the window. 

A particularly important glass that most people do not consider as such is ice cream. In creating ice cream, one must rapidly cool the cream and sugar mixture so that it does not assume its absolute lowest energy state and become a crystalline solid. This process of rapid cooling is called quenching and it is essential to how all glasses are made. In analytical calculations involving glasses we always assume there is a quenched distribution of a particular parameter which is to say that we take the distribution of parameter values to be fixed with respect to the time scale of equilibration. To say that the values of this parameter are fixed relative to the time scale of equilibration is not to say that the parameter is fluctuating so slowly that it appears to be constant, but rather that the parameter has relaxed so quickly that it is already time-independent by when all other variables are fluctuating. 

There is a particular analytical representation of quenching in equilibrium calculations. It involves averaging the logarithm of the partition function over the possible values of the quenched parameter. This averaging raises a basic question: Why do we take this averaging? How does the analytical representation of quenching follow from the fact that the system is rapidly cooled?

Partition Function of a Black Hole
Almost a decade ago, the physicist Jarmo produced a derivation for the partition function of a black hole. I don't know if it is correct but it is certainly not highly cited. I would like to review the derivation and include it as a problem in my document. The phrasing of the problem would be something like

Derive the partition function of a black hole? What about the partition function of two black holes? (Use the derivation in \cite{makela2011partition} as a model.)

Short Summary of the History of Entropy 
The concept of entropy was first discovered/developed when engineers realized that the energy released in combustion reactions could not be completely converted into useful work. There are a number of important figures in the history of entropy. Clausius, Carnot (both son and father), Boltzmann, Gibbs, Von Neumann, and Shannon. It probably warrants a more detailed historical investigation.

Entropy, Sun, and the evolution of Life
Life consists of highly ordered structures which are ostensibly entropically unfavorable. This fact raises the question: How is life able to maintain such an entropically unfavorable configuration? The short answer is that life is not at thermal equilibrium and is instead getting a continuous influx of energy from the sun. Apparently it is possible to show that given the amount of energy which is conveyed to organisms on earth such organisms are comprise structures with much more entropy than the possible minimum. 

General Relativity and the Energy of the Universe
In Jacob's lectures (or one of them) he noted that by general relativity, the energy of the universe was not necessarily conserved. This seemed to be a strange statement to me. Looking online it seems to relate to the fact that although the covariant derivative of the energy momentum tensor is zero, this does not in turn imply that the surface integral of the energy momentum tensor is zero.

Hi MITES 2018 Physics III students, 

I hope the last months of your senior year are treating you all well!

I will be teaching MITES Physics III again this summer and I'm thinking about changing a few things. In particular, I'm planning to teach a course on Mathematical Biology/Theoretical Biophysics and transitioning to a course structure with less lecturing and more group discussion on problems (akin to what we did during the last few days of last summer's class). 

I've compiled a short (and anonymous) questionnaire about last year's course and would appreciate your feedback on how the course was structured and what you think we can improve upon. The questionnaire is anonymous, but you can also email me directly if you would like a direct response. 

Finally, I remember the month of April being extraordinarily busy during my senior year so no worries if you don't get a chance to complete the questionnaire. 

Best,
Mobolaji

The point is that, increasingly, cognitive science is coming to a shocking conclusion—a conclusion so important in its ramifications that it deserves to be set apart: Intelligent people perform better only when you tell them what to do. [bold in original]— Keith Stanovich What Intelligence Tests Miss pg. 99

There's this idea that intelligence represents more of an ability to function optimally within a prescribed set of rules and structures rather than the deeper ability to determine what rules and structures are correct and then function accordingly. I can't remember exactly where I first heard this (perhaps in Disciplined Minds) but it certainly seems consonant with our general depiction of intelligence in school. Students who make good grades are seen as intelligent, a characterization which reveals more about the society supplying the label than about those to whom it is applied. In his book Stanovich is making a seemingly provocative claim. Performance (variously measured) and intelligence are only correlated when intelligence is supplemented with explicit instructions. Without such instructions intelligent people only perform marginally better than those who are not considered intelligent. 

The metric of performance which preceded Stanovich's quote above was whether question askers could recognize and inconsistencies in personal positions on an ethical problem. When test takers were told to be aware of such inconsistencies, they were able to avoid them but otherwise all people (even those on the higher end of the IQ spectrum) were susceptible. Continuing the above claim, Stanovich states

I am referring here specifically to the domain of rational thought and action. If you tell intelligent people what a rational requirement is—if you inform them about a particular structure of rational thought (avoid intransitivity, avoid framing, do not be overconfident in your own knowledge, etc.)—and then give them a task that requires following that stricture, higher-IQ individuals will adhere to the stricture better than individuals of lower intelligence. However, if you give people tasks without warning them that a particular rational principle is involved—If they have to notice themselves [italics in original] that an issue of rationality is involved—individuals of higher intelligence do little better than their counterparts of lower intelligence. — Keith Stanovich What Intelligence Tests Miss pg. 100


I am forced to wonder what implications this claim has for graduate education. The undergraduate students who become Ph.D students are those who managed to excel within the structures created by many dozens of courses, and as such students work through their Ph.Ds they are again asked to operate within the framework supplied by a Ph.D advisor or a general graduate program. Success in the Ph.D would thus depend on a number of factors not all of which stem from characteristics of the student: How clear of a structure the advisor can provide; How skilled the advisor is in helping the student navigate that structure; How scrupulous the student is in attending to the structural cues provided by the advisor. It is a woefully dependent depiction of graduate education. It is a caricature, undoubtedly, but it is one which to zeroth order matches the experiences of many graduate students: The advisor chooses the project and the framing question and the student works out the details. 

My problem with this mode of education was—and still is—that it makes science seem too professional and too utilitarian as if one were training the scientist to provide a service to some future overlord. Why can't the student choose the project for her or himself? Cynical possibility: it would require the advisor to relinquish control over the student's work and future. Less cynical possibility: it would mean the advisor couldn't provide detailed guidance if the student were to get stuck. Least cynical possibility: the advisor has more experience in choosing projects and would be much more capable than the student in selecting an appropriate one. Maybe, but this does not seem to be universal. The first projects Jesse and Ariel assigned me were both busts. Everyone's graduate experience is individual and different, but my experience within the institutions of education has led me to have a profound distrust of systems which are ostensibly meant to cultivate in me the qualities I will need in the future. There are those who have existed placidly and comfortably in such systems their entire lives and thus might be led to believe there is some assurance in abiding by the associated strictures. My past suggests different and thus I live differently.

Being a good theoretical physicist
What makes someone a good theoretical physicist? I ask because I was recently reminded of Baldwin's quote at the end of his introduction to Notes from a Native Son. In the last sentences, Baldwin said he wanted to be a good person and a good writer. If I were writing something similar I would want to be both of those things, and I would also want to be a good physicist. But what does it mean to be a good physicist. (I could also ask what does it mean to be a "good person" and a "good writer", but I'll focus on physics at the moment). The question of physics in general is hard enough, so I'll focus on something ostensibly easier: What does it mean to be a good theoretical physicist?

I don't think there is an absolute definition. In the history of physics, what has made someone a good theorist has varied from person to person and from context to context. Einstein was not a superb mathematician, but he was still a good theorist because he was constantly able to reduce a question to its foundational elements, interrogate those elements, and then build new theoretical structures from the simple answers he found. 

Feynman once noted (correctly) that much of his own most famous work did not involve the development of a new physical model for some unexplained phenomena, but we still consider Feynman to be a good theorist because he was able to develop useful alternative mathematical formalisms for existing models. 

Freeman Dyson moved from mathematics to physics, and in one of his early forays into theory he worked with Feynman. He once said (in Disturbing the Universe, I think) that his ability to solve problems was dependent on how well-defined the question he was given was. Thus, Dyson felt that he had disappointed Oppenheimer, who had seen great things in him, because he was not like the great theorists of the past who were able to find and solve problems for themselves. But Dyson was a great unifier of formalism. He recognized the semblance between Schwinger's, Tomonaga's, and Feynman's individual approaches to quantum electrodynamics and was able to show why they were all equivalent. Thus he led the physics community to see the utility in Feynman's idiosyncratic (but calculationally easier) methods. 

Chandrasekhar is most well-known for his work on the collapse of white dwarf stars, and  I imagine he would not appear on any (undoubtedly ill-conceived) list of the 20th century's top theoretical physicists. Chandrasekhar was a rather independent physicist and his work does not track well with any larger historical arc shared by his contemporaries. It seems that he worked on what he wanted when he wanted and was not greatly influenced by trends in his field. Thus, (as far as I know) he never swooped in like a superhero to rescue his colleagues from some thorny theoretical problem that they could not see their way through. Such an act seems part and parcel with the life histories of those we consider the best theorists. However, Chandrasekhar's work was prolific and comprehensive. He remained in astrophysics all of his life but he would spend a decade researching a topic like radiative process, stellar structure or magnetohydrodynamics, would write a textbook on the topic, and then would move on to a new topic. He repeated this cycle throughout his life, so that he eventually worked in many of the major areas of astrophysics. 

I notice that this list of good theorists is lop-sidedly gendered (not to mention racial). The question one could ask is "Why are there no "good" women theorists from the 20th century?" but this seems to be a loaded question. There is another question which is founded on different assumptions: "Why are "good" women theorists not recognized?" The only 20th century women theorists I know are Emmy Noether from the early part of the century and Ann Nelson and Lisa Randall from the end of the century. My ignorance in this regard does not portent good things for my supposed egalitarianism. How could I learn more about the unrecognized women theorists of this century?


These characterizations suggest that one cannot conclusively and as precisely as possible define what it means to be a "good theorist" and hope to capture the traits of all theorists who have existed and who will exist in the future. Einstein, Feynman, Dyson, Chandrasekhar, and Emmy Noether were all good theorists in unique ways. They did, however, have a few general traits in common. They all completed work that their community (sometimes after many decades) found valuable. Also, each of them seemed to have a unique aesthetic sense of what was interesting in their discipline a sense which they pursued in all of their work. This aesthetic sense was neither completely shared by their colleagues nor absolutely reflective of the physical world they sought to model, but it was nevertheless foundational to these physicists contributions to their scientific communities and to the models they constructed of the world. Indeed the fact that this sense was not shared by their colleagues is perhaps what made their contributions so valuable since it was something the community could not develop without them. 

The lesson from these stories is that if one wants to be a good theorist one should have personal values about what is interesting about the physical world, your discipline, or knowledge in general and make those values manifest in the work you do (while not begrudging your peers for not emulating your values). It seems that many physicists do not do this, and instead seem to emulate the values of their advisors or of the luminaries of their field. The work these physicists produce can be technically good, but  is perhaps undistinguished from the works of their colleagues. 

Still, I recognize that in spite of having personal values, one should not become trapped by these values but should try to augment them by finding new ways to appreciate the work of one's predecessors and contemporaries. It seems every generation of physicists disparages the philosophical values underlying the work of the subsequent generation, and thus this older generation misses out on new ways to study the world. We should thus learn from their successes as well as their failures. 

Now, we are led to a different question, perhaps the question we should have asked in the first place: Why? Why do I want to be a good theorist? Is it because of some nascent insecurity which has left me looking for validation in my current work? Is it because of some desire for pride in existing in the higher echelons of some intellectual hierarchy? Or is it because I want to be as faithful as possible to the good practices of my discipline so that I do not disrespect it or myself by doing poor work? 

I'm not sure I could say conclusively what my motivations are. In my life, I have seen evidence for affirmative answers to all of the previous questions. So perhaps I am motivated by a complex of things. The black wolf and the white wolf (in the apocryphal Indian legend) and all the shades of grey in between. One's motivations certainly change how one pursues one's objectives. Such motivations affect the means one chooses, and even how such means are implemented. I like to believe, however, I can recognize when darker forces are directing my path and that I have the ability to stop, think, and direct myself otherwise.

On Teaching: Importance of Fundamentals
In being a teaching assistant for Physics 101, I have learned (or relearned?) many important lessons about teaching. One recent lesson concerned providing answers to students. Often if a problem called for a long calculation, Jacob would provide the answer to the problem so that students could check their results. However, in assisting students, I have found that the provided answer was often a distraction rather than a supplement. When given the answer, students would work to reproduce the answer rather than internalizing the objective of the question or trying to find the answer themselves without the crutch of what it "should" look like. It seemed like in the students head, they were solving a puzzle in which they started with the given equations and then had to reproduce, using valid rules of algebra and calculus, the stated result. In other words, to the students, the question that framed the problem often appeared to be peripheral to their focus. There were two sets of consequences associated with this behavior. First, if students obtained a correct answer with correct logic, they would usually be unable to interpret what they found. They would thus be incapable of applying the answer to the subsequent parts of the problem which called for it. I noticed this trend for the Hawking Temperature problems (where T_H was given) and the quantum harmonic oscillator problems (where the action of the number operator and raising and lowering operators were given). 

Alternatively, students would be so focused on the final answer that they would "break" the rules of algebra and calculus in an attempt to obtain it. This observation leads me to the main point of this essay: Understanding the fundamentals of mathematics is incredibly important in university level physics education. Most of the mathematics that students apply in physics consists of just higher-level manifestations of calculus and algebra, and so if students do not learn the basics of either subject well they will be unable to contend with the mathematics in physics. 


Moreover, in basic calculations, a lack of knowledge of these fundamentals would lead students to being bogged down by algebraic mistakes they simply should not make. And unlike with writing in which one can compose a fairly coherent essay without being completely faithful to the mechanics of grammar, it is not possible to compose a logical derivation of a mathematical result without being completely faithful to the mechanics of mathematics. For example, I think it is reasonable to get stuck in a 20 line calculation because one forgot a factor of two in transcribing line 7 from line 6. But, I do not think it is reasonable to get stuck in a calculation because one believes that e^(ab) = e^(a+b) or because one thinks that the solution to df/dx = bf is f(x) = e^(bx) + C, both of which are mistakes I saw from more than one person this semester. 

Less flagrant is an analytic myopia which leaves students being unable to get from A to B because they lack flexibility in applying the mathematics they supposedly know well. Yesterday I spoke with a student who was somewhat distressed that the answer they found did not match the one quoted in the assignment. Comparing the student's expression and the one on the assignment I realized the two could be made equivalent through an application of sin^2x+ cos^2x = 1 and a division, both of which the student dutifully executed when I pointed it out to him. At another time, I saw many students get stuck on the first part of a derivation of Hawking temperature because when given equations relating energy to mass, mass to radius, radius to area, and area to entropy, they could not express the energy of a black hole in terms of its entropy. 

On my part, I have never paid as much attention as I perhaps should to the fundamentals of mathematics. I was always enamored by the next sexy thing I could learn. Multivariable calculus! Differential Equations! Differential Forms! It all seemed so wonderful. But I of course was blessed with having  good mathematics teachers during my K-12 education and I had spent a lot of personal time in high school building my mathematical knowledge in new directions. So the fundamentals were never really a problem for me. My mistake was believing they were also not a problem for other people. 

I think I doubled-down on this mistake in the Physics III course I taught last year. I will ask Ife and Anastasia about this tomorrow, and I should carefully read through my course reviews again, but I suspect that I conveyed to my students less than I thought I had. I had thought the best thing I could give to students was the experience of working through difficult material and being able to making it out to the other end. Now, I think that the best thing I can give to students is extensive practice in the fundamentals of mathematics. I think the Art of Problem Solving books were greatly beneficial in this regard because they showed me new and non-traditional ways that simple mathematics could be applied. Working through these books thus made me much more adept at manipulating analytic expressions. I have been meaning to write an essay about whether such skills are still useful in this modern computational era, but even if they have less absolute importance than in the past—for example, in the same way Faraday was a great physicist because he was a great experimentalist even though he was quite ignorant of mathematics, I can imagine someone today being a great physicist by being a great computationalist even if they are somewhat ignorant of analytic methods—such are still relevant to understanding the formal presentation of physical theories. 

Outside of these hard skills, I think the other important thing I should try to teach students is how to monitor and articulate their own confusion. Such is a skill that few students try to learn often because courses do not explicitly require it of them. In Physics 101, if a student did not know how to do something, they would sometimes fail to recognize they did not know how to do it and would instead attempt a (typically wrong) procedure. Now, guesses in the face ignorance are fine, but such guesses should be checked and calibrated against established knowledge and the formal ways such problems are already solved, something these students never thought to do. (Perhaps because they did not realize they were doing something wrong?)

Self-monitoring is a hard enough skill to cultivate in myself, so I am not sure how I would cultivate it in the students I teach, but one practice that I know is crucial to such cultivation is writing. Algebraic manipulations can obscure thought and lead one to believing one understands more than one does. It is often only when one writes out an explanation of what one is doing and why one is doing it that the logical gaps and inadequacies become clear. 



Miscellanea 
- I would often find students who did not know how to do something, but would not recognize that they did not know, and thus would end up implementing an incorrect procedure. Students were not good at recognizing what they did or did not know about mathematics

- Part of the issue is that students are not really trying to answer the question as stated, but are unconsciously trying to guess what the instructor wants from them. 

- I also recently realized the importance of the fundamentals of mathematics. I was blessed with having a good K-12 education and I also spent a lot of personal time building my mathematical knowledge in new directions. So there are some algebraic mistakes that I simply do not make. Now, I do make many many transcription mistakes due to inattention (such as forgetting powers of two in moving from line to line in a calculation). But I would not make the mistake of thinking e^(ab) = e^(a + b). 

- Perhaps it is because students do not understand why the rules they learned are good rules, and thus they commit them to memory superficially.

Learning derivations and new subjects in physics
Ever since I entered university, learning new subjects in physics has been somewhat difficult for me. I initially thought that my first few years spent learning on my own biased my value system so that although I can understand the individual steps of a derivation in a new subject, I often cannot appreciate the overall objective the derivation seeks to achieve (i.e., why the inciting question is asked in the first place). Now, I think that if I read through a derivation and that is the only thing I read, I am focusing on the superficial products of a much longer line of reasoning. All disciplines have their own value systems, their individual senses of what is a good question to ask, what is a good investigation to undertake, and thus learning a subject entails not only learning the methods of the subject but also what kinds of questions those methods are applied to and why those questions are asked in the first place.  

I think my past mistakes in learning stemmed from being too focused on technical apparatus and not sufficiently aware of the larger value system which informs those methods. So, I am devising a new framework for learning a new subject or just a derivation within a subject. There are four important practices in this framework: Connect to what you know. Commit to the foundations. Learn the history. Understand the values.

Connect to what you know: When learning something new, find ways the work can be connected to what you already know. All knowledge exists in a well-connected network, so it should be possible to situate this new knowledge within the knowledge you already possess. 

Commit to the foundations: All subjects in physics have foundational elements upon which the more technical applications are built. Impatience might lead one to quickly pursue the sexier technical domains, but this would be a mistake for such domains inevitably rely on methods and epistemic mindsets built in the foundations. Moreover, the foundations are more likely to be connected the most well connected to your existing knowledge, so focusing on the foundations will lead the work to being situated in your network of knowledge. 

Understand the values: The archetypes which form the canon of a subject exist within a value system that privileges certain methods and questions are over others. At the very least one should understand what this value system is, and beyond this one should try to understand why the subject has this value system. Understanding the value system would give one a better context for the questions a subject answers and understanding why said value system exists would provide a better sense of how the subject relates to others. 

This is to say you should situate the value system within your network of value systems. For example, the value system of mid-century theoretical physics was geared around predicting phenomena at extreme scales. The value system of early 21st century high energy physics is geared around studying the mathematical properties of the theories which describe physics at extreme scales. The value system of the community evolved into the latter due to the rapid pace that theory progressed relative to experimental science. 

Learn the history: Informing both the foundations and value system of a subject is the subject's history. My interest in physics began along a historical front because it was through reading the autobiographies of Feynman and Dyson, that I was led to study physics. The benefit of this reading was that long before I studied quantum electrodynamics I had a sense of what one calculated in the subject and why. Thus, due to my prior reading of history, one epistemic hurdle was partly cleared ever before I studied the subject. 

The history of a subject is also quite interesting, and provides greater context for the new developments in the subject. For example, I recently learned that the partition function was developed by Planck in the 1920s and not by Gibbs or Boltzmann in the 19th century. However, the history of modern subjects is still being written so one must turn to review articles to find useful summaries of a subject's history.  

The above framework is for learning subjects at large. If one is trying to learn a derivation or understand an argument in a paper, learning the history of the problem is perhaps less important, but it is still important to understand the values that underly the derivation and to connect the derivation to what you know. We can reduce the above framework to two practices: 

Step-outside derivation: Step outside the derivation and, using your existing knowledge, build up the derivation's starting point and auxiliary assumptions. The author of a derivation often begins from an epistemic framing quite different from your own, and accepting his or her framing as a starting point can be quite confusing. Instead it is better to start from a place you understand and build up to the author's starting assumptions. Often such work makes it easier to understand the subsequent steps of the derivation. 

Articulate question: Articulate (for yourself) the question the derivation answers and try to understand why the question is being asked. Authors do not always clearly state the first and almost never state the second. But it is of crucial importance for you to know the question that is being asked since all steps in the derivation are chosen n an attempt to move closer to an answer to that question. If one doesn't recognize the larger question, the individual steps of the derivation can seem arbitrary and unusually inspired. 

I will add this to my ongoing list of helpful articles for students.

Lessons in Education 
I once claimed that there were three main problems in education: 1) There is undue focus on the teacher; 2) Learning is tied to evaluation; 3) There is no voice for the students in terms of what they learn. These problems undermine students learning by making these students too dependent on the teacher to provide needed information, focusing the students on getting good grades rather than walking away with something deeper, and cultivating passivity in learning. I listed these problems about half a dozen years ago, so I should supposedly know them well. And yet when I was given my first opportunity to teach I made all the mistakes I claimed teachers had made in the past. I lectured for 95% of the time. I assigned problem sets which were difficult and graded. And I did not give students an opportunity to tell me what they wanted to learn. 

In my work as a TF for Physics 101, I see Jacob making many of the same mistakes. He enjoys lecturing and he is good at it, but I'm not sure how much the class, on average, gets from his lectures. Students sit in their chairs, see Jacob write out a derivation or a discussion of the topic, and then they transcribe his words and his board work. The students walk away with a written record of what was covered in class, but could that time not have been better spent with the student working through the material for him or herself? I realize my experience learning physics is unique. Not everyone learned the basics of the subject on their own, but I think trying to work through a topic on your own, rather than getting it pre-digested from a teacher, goes a long way towards cultivating the independence necessary to build an individual understanding of the subject. I made this mistake last summer as well. I spent too much time trying to compose well-written and clear lecture notes, and too little time thinking about how to best convey the requisite information to students. My evaluations made this rather clear. In them the students told me the lectures were well-done but ultimately deficient because I did not teach them how to solve problems like the ones I assigned.

I can correct that this summer. If I cut down the lecture material by 1/3, I can spend the rest of the time, discussing problems with students. I can write shorter problems with earlier problems more like exercises and later problems more like the mid-level problems I assigned last year. I can also make the midterm and final exams grounded in group work. This would relieve the stress of the class. 

I'm not sure if these changes would work, but I think they are a good first step towards incorporating my educational philosophy into my teaching. 

Feeling Lost and Being Found
I have felt lost many times at Harvard, lost in the sense of being in some place at some time but not knowing what I was doing here or what I should do with the ample opportunities which had been laid at my feet. Many of these opportunities were unrequested and thus appeared more like burdens, responsibilities to future versions of myself, yet to be even contemplated if not merely yet to be realized. But not all of our responsibilities in this world, the first of which was being born and living on earth at a certain place and time, are ones we asked for. And even if we cannot optimize our actions in the moment, we must still act dealing with the consequences of suboptimal decisions as we go on. I did not always realize this. I had always a wanted to perceive a certain solidity in my future. I wanted to be able to see my way forward. But this can only work for so long, and even if it always works by some metric, it is inevitably limiting. If we held to true to the principle that steps must be taken with clarity and certainty then our world would be static, boundaries between ideas and people would not change, we would never be surprised. We can only project ourselves so far before we hit clouds of uncertainty and ignorance, and if we choose not to enter this cloud because we do not know where or how we might land, then we circumscribe our potential, making it less likely that even our conservative projections will take us to where we want to go. 

But faith, judiciously applied affords us with the ability to move beyond the limitations of our vision. With faith we can go to places we have never before known existed.

I am not talking about faith in a religious sense. Or perhaps I am? This is not a faith in a deity, but rather faith in identity constantly changing, in life, in a universe which is, without interpretation, meaningless but nevertheless rational. It is religion in a deep sense, something I think which exists at the basis of all religions. The belief that life is worth living even if it may not always appear to be.

Miscellanea
- Not all of our necessary responsibilities are one's we asked for. None of us chose to be birthed on this planet at this time, but there is a latent responsibility with that birth, one which is manifest if only latently in each second we pass on this earth. 

- This is why faith is important. You will not always know what exactly to do next, but often you still must step forward and continue on.

Add to "What does it mean to understand?" 
It is perhaps easier to define the markers of understanding according to negative criteria rather than positive ones. We cannot say for certain that someone understands a subject, but there are certain things said person would not be able to do if they did not understand the subject.

This is perhaps a logical problem. Someone who has property A can do a_1, a_2, a_3, …. But someone who can do a_1, a_2, a_3,… does not necessarily have property A. Thus, at best we can take the contrapositive of this claim and say that someone who cannot do a_1, a_2, a_3,… does not have property A. However, this appear to be too black and white, too much like Popper's definition of falsifiability in science, a definition which was so stringent that applying it rendered virtually all modern theories of science falsified and thus all modern scientists as irrational for engaging with them. Rather, what we need perhaps is not criteria for whether understanding absolutely does not exist, but criteria to distinguish between different levels of understanding. 

Some course graining would be necessary to define various levels of understanding. Fortunately this was mostly done for us by Bloom in his discussion of knowledge.
 
Understanding is too metaphysical a phrase, too difficult to pin down. Besides when people refer to understanding they are often referring to a specific set of actions that can be performed by someone with understanding. Thus, it would prove easier to drop the word itself and deal directly with the actions for which it is a proxy. However, because these actions are specific to our interpretation of understanding we would need to be explicit in stating that these are not universal actions defining whether or not someone understands.

Who deserves empathy?
Who deserves empathy? It is a question I contend with constantly although I always do so indirectly. There are people who are in pain all around me, a pain which I cannot see, but which I nevertheless know is there because these people, like me, are human. How do I choose to respond to this humanity? How do I choose to connect with it? Often my decision is grounded in self-preservation, a desire to protect myself from pain regardless of if such protection hurts others. And so I learn the language of my oppressors, communicating to them the same disdain I feel they communicate to me. 

People can be quite callous to those who they think have no interior lives. Why be empathetic to those without emotion? This is how I imagine women see men in this society. Men are taught (or at least told) to be strong and stoic and many men are able to display the facade so well that women are deluded into believing it is real. And thus men's spartan emotional acculturation has come full circle to make them vulnerable in ways they could not foresee. You deny the existence of an inevitable emotion like sadness and fear, and you not only open yourself to being harmed and controlled by said emotion in ways you cannot anticipate, but you also make it possible for others to subtly use the claim that you do not exhibit real emotion as reason enough to deny you compassion. In other words, it is easy to disregard feelings which you do not believe are there. And so I can walk through the halls of the Harvard physics department and be ignored by women I greeted the day before and they can go on believing they are good people. 

But what am I doing by claiming this? The people who "drove me out" (so to speak) of the physics department were few relative to the people who welcomed me. And it is not true that it was only women who pretended like I didn't exist. But it is true that I felt the sting more intensely when it came from a woman. There are reasons for both of these distortions, for why the few rejections felt more impactful than the much more frequent sentiments of acceptance or indifference, for why when a woman looked away from me I felt an anger and frustration I did not feel when a man did so. This cultural moment has no explanation for the former, but for the latter it would be said that I as a man in American society have been taught that women owe me attention and kindness and when these things are withheld I consequently react in the way all people react when stolen privileges are revoked: like a child who is denied a lollipop. Thus, it might be said, my anger at female rejection is simply my mind impinging upon a new reality in which women need not feel beholden to the happiness of men, and men are being forced to realize that women are not inanimate pieces of candy to be picked up and fondled at will. 

I appreciate the simplicity of this story. It is a convenient one for those who navigate through the waters of conquest and redemption and who like to believe there is a karmic justice to the world: Men feel pain from particular experiences but this pain is invalid (and thus need not be responded to with empathy) because it is due to these men failing to confront their internalized sexism. I only wish I could find some honest way to apply this story to my life. Because, when I look internally and inspect why I feel the way I do whenever I lock eyes with a woman, I see a personal history of loneliness and vulnerability and impotence. And thus when I see a woman, my heart rate increases and my breathing becomes shallow not because of anything I see in her but in what I see and feel in my own history. And it is not a history associated with the belief that women owe me anything. Rather it is a history which started at a time in my life when I was particularly sensitive to acceptance and rejection, sensitive to what exactly my role in society was, sensitive to the new hormonal urges that made women seem completely unlike men. These early desultory experiences were scarring to extents that have yet to heal. And what I have walked away with is a feeling that I was taken advantage of, that women had power over me and they used this power irresponsibly with no regard for my feelings. And my conclusion, unconsciously rendered and unarticulated, is that on some level these women and women like them do not deserve empathy because they had no empathy for me. 

Thus, my true question is revealed: Do those who do not exhibit empathy deserve empathy in return? My telling should reveal this question to exist on top of another whose answer is presumed to be known but which can never in fact be known. How do you know when someone is exhibiting empathy? How do you know when someone is making a conscious decision—perhaps the only kind of decision to which you can hold a person to account—to supply empathy or to deny it? What even is empathy? 

If we claim that empathy is compassion, rendered as recognition of, patience with, and salubrious response to another person's pain, then it seems that empathy requires a number of factors not all of which are under conscious control. Recognition requires clarity. Patience requires peace. And the appropriate response requires agency and power of the kind which is at the very source of the question of who deserves empathy in the first place. 

And so, on one level, I realize I can frame my personal story in terms of monolithic identities and thus come to a simple explanation for why I asked this question and for what the answer is: Women believe men do not deserve empathy because men's pain comes from entitlement and misused power.  I believe women do not deserve empathy because women believe (and act on the idea) that men do not deserve empathy. 

On a deeper level, I realize there are problems with this framing. Problems concerning claims of who has power, who is misusing power, and how should the supposedly bereaved party respond (i.e., with freely given empathy or with its withholding). One thing to be clear of is that my own sense of impotency in my interactions with women was and still is self-fabricated. Simply because one feels that one has no power does not in fact mean that one is powerless. And in fact claims of self-impotence often lead to perpetration rather than victimization, for if one believes that one has no influence over one's life, then acts of self-preservation need not be regulated against how such acts affect others. You unilaterally paint yourself as the victim and you thus free yourself from the standard social lens through which people realize they must be accountable to people other than themselves.

So in ways similar to how I see my own apparent victimization, I see these stories aligning women with perpetual states of victimization as problematic. In these stories, the tellers (often women) constantly substitute a personal sentiment of female impotency with the reality of impotency. And thus if anything negative were to happen between a man and a woman, the woman need not take responsibility for she had no power to control the situation in the first place. But of course there are differences of degree and differences in kind, and I think we are better than the black and white dichotomies we might feel pushed to employ to render the world simpler than it really is. Sexual encounters which go wrong (a state which in of itself requires definition) are not inevitably the responsibility of any single party, and claims to the contrary, indeed claims by one kind of party that it is primarily the fault of the other kind party, should be viewed with suspicion. 

But, no. I've heard that in male-female sexual encounters there is always a power differential and that differential always favors the man. Perhaps it is akin to the claim that white people of today, who had no direct participation in the racism of 60 years ago, are still beneficiaries of that racism and thus are responsible for dismantling it. But said racism has a socioeconomic refraction in a way that sexism does not. Wealth, and its concomitant power, can be passed on from generation to generation within a racial group in ways that the two are not passed on within a gender group. Men do not pass on their wealth to all men in the next generation, but white people (at least those who have the wealth to do so) certainly do. 

However this perspective makes significant the so called "intersection"—so called because an intersection is predicated on the idea that two sets have a logical difference in definition and not merely one built from histories of conquest and subjugation—between gender and race. Because although wealth may remain within a racial group, the gender politics of a culture can lead that wealth to be concentrated in the males of that group thus leading to the generational power disparity between genders that I claim does not exist. But then what we  would have is a specific cross section of the population where power and influence are relevant. In this sense, only white women would be able to claim to be impotent relative to white men. (And how exactly would you define whiteness is something I will not event get into). The claim that white women are impotent in the face of black men would require too specific of a cultural analysis to yield fruit. And what of black women and black men, neither of whom had the opportunities to build wealth or exercise power of the kind held by their lighter contemporaries? And what of those of south American, central American, east Asian, south Asian, middle eastern, eastern European, and western European dissent? Would the complications of ethnicity, race, and gender force us to constantly look into the cultural and social history of the ethnic group's of the relevant parties before we could claim who had the most power and thus who was ultimately "responsible" for what ever occurred?  

This is to say I think this talk of power in the realm of sexual encounters is misleading and perhaps even beside the point. If power was such a unifying element in cases of sexual assault then it would be deployed in much the same way in all of these cases, and it is clear that it is not. People focus so much on the sexual assault accusations of movie executives and politicians that they forget such accusations exist on more mundane planes. Freshman men and women meeting on a college campus do not have such a large power differential between them that the man could really be "getting off" on his control over the career and future of the woman. And yet the language surrounding these two cases—the case of the lascivious movie director assaulting the neophyte actress and the male student fumbling his way through a new sexual encounter—are the same, and the solid sense of who is the victim is smeared between the two such that men are rendered as inevitable perpetrators. 

I still not have answered the question that began this section: Who deserves empathy? This meandering was meant to contextualize the fact that I do not know the answer. I do not know who deserves empathy. I do not know if I believe that anyone really deserves anything. But I do know that humans float so constantly amongst the states of victim and perpetrator and something in between that these terms cannot ever define useful metrics to ascertain who is the aggrieved and thus who deserves emotional solidarity. And I do know that the myopia of individual experiences makes it difficult for people to recognize as real the pain of another especially when they themselves have experienced pain at this other's hand. And I do know that compassion, patience, and recognition make life easier by providing emotional lubricant to situations which might otherwise ignite under accumulated friction. But knowing all these things does not release me from the question; it only complicates my attempt at an answer. 

The question is perhaps not the correct one. I ask "Who deserves empathy?" when in fact I'm wondering how I should respond to the people who cause me pain. So far my policy has been to avoid such people and escape the casual slights which they intentionally or unintentionally inflect. But I've learned this approach slowly circumscribes the spaces in which I navigate. Why should my world be limited by the pain they have caused me? 

You open yourself up to people by revealing something real and true to yourself about them, and you open yourself up to a rejection of that truth. Does this mean that you should never be open again? Or rather does it mean you should write another story surrounding the ultimate end goals of that openness? You had believed that you were so open because you wanted to create authentic opportunities to connect with others. Perhaps it would be better to be open simply because it is preferable to hiding closed away from the world and ultimately yourself. 

There is one view that you should give empathy freely and continuously with the hope that you can heal whatever pain was the impetus for someone else hurting you. Maybe you give enough, you act as a sufficiently admirable archetype for compassion and both you and them (and the proverbial world) are changed. But now, I don't know about this. It seems it is too tall an order and can lead to disillusionment if one's unarticulated expectations on when the conversion should occur are not fulfilled. I think it is better to place the metric of success not in others but in oneself. Other people do not deserve empathy because of some change that might occur in them. Who knows how they would respond to your compassion? Who knows if they will even recognize it? Who knows if their world view is sufficiently expansive to even see you as a person worthy of receiving empathy from? Too many variables to found any reasonable notion of faith. 

You give empathy to others in order to induce a change in yourself. In order to release yourself from anger and hatred and frustration. In order to wake up without the weight of pain from yesterday and without prematurely taking on the anticipated burdens of tomorrow.  

I do not know how others will respond to my empathy. But I know that how I will respond to the empathy I give others is much better than how I would respond to the spite I send their way as a means of revenge. Who was it that said hating a person is like you swallowing poison and hoping the other person dies as a result? Maybe loving a person is like swallowing an elixir and hoping the other person is healed. Both are delusions, perhaps, but only one has the possibility of healing you, and thus only one is sustainable.

On Monday of this week I had an interesting conversation with Ariel Amir. I had made the infrequent trek to the third floor of Pierce in order to visit Michael Brenner. He wasn't in his office and as I was walking back towards the hallway Ariel was leaving his office and we saw each other. I gave a cordial greeting and he gave one as well, but then a thought seemed to have occurred to him. He asked me if I had a minute for a meeting. I went into his office thinking that he wanted to discuss my recent "Permutation glass" paper, but my egocentrism had gotten the better of me. 

He said he had noticed that I was doing well and putting work on arxiv and publishing it in the physical review, but that he was worried because my publications were all single author. He said that single author publications might seem like a good idea at the time, but that it is important to work with an advisor and receive input and assistance from him and her. Ariel mentioned his own experience as a Ph. D student and stated that advisors can provide guidance which is only appreciated years down the line. 

I was taken aback by both the content and the source of this advice. It was so reminiscent of what Jesse Thaler had told me years ago. Back then he had said that his most interesting work during graduate school was a single-author publication on hidden local symmetry, but since he was an unknown in the field that paper was rarely read while less interesting papers he wrote with his advisor were more highly cited. Jesse's claim was that working with an advisor (particularly a well-known one) was, career-wise, the better choice because it ensured that your work was read. Now, Ariel was saying it was better to work with an advisor because said advisor could provide necessary guidance. 

I only later wondered why specifically Ariel was telling me this. Why did he all of a sudden care about my career when two and a half years ago he had seemed indifferent? Where was this concern when he was telling me that he would not take me on as a student? Where was this concern when I was struggling to schedule a meeting with him in the months after he told me this? The deep irony in Ariel's advice is that my desire to work independently of an advisor was without a doubt motivated by my past experience working with him as my advisor. My experience with him revealed the consequences of the power-differential at the source of the bargain between advisors and graduate students and had made it clear that advisors rarely navigate that differential responsibly. 

And yet here he was suggesting I re-enter that bargain because it was "good for my career". What happened to make him so interested? I think the change started after I published the statistical physics of the symmetric group article. Fall of last year, I saw him at the Greater Boston statistical physics meeting and he congratulated me for the publication and told me that I did a good job with it. I was surprised that he had read the work and that he had even thought it was interesting enough to comment upon. By that point I had thought that we mutually agreed that our previous attempt at collaboration was a failure and that all that was left was for us to give polite greetings to one another whenever we couldn't avoid each other in the hallway. There had been times when I could have sworn he had seen me during a talk and yet he pretended he had not. Admittedly such an incident was sufficiently trivial as to be misinterpreted and I know that personal insecurity, deeply set, is often reflected back by the world. But still, even without considering this incident, my earlier work experiences with Ariel were cool and distanced. The project he gave me was intractable and uninteresting and I felt largely alone in making it work. And these conditions felt all the more devastating after he said he wouldn't take me on as a student. Everything ultimately worked out for the better, but sitting in his room I could not shake feeling that there was something strange about someone expressing concern for a career that they themselves had earlier put in jeopardy. 

Ariel did have a point though: An advisor can help you in ways you may not immediately appreciate. I realized this in my first meeting with Eugene when he seemed to immediately intuit the relevance and importance of the permutation work. In the HBO series Westworld there is this concept of "the cornerstone". When the engineers in the story were building the hosts (i.e., the androids) that populated the theme park, they gave each one a memory that the host returned to again and again. The memory formed the foundational element (the cornerstone, so to speak) of the identity of the host and ultimately shaped how the host saw and experienced the world. All people have such "cornerstones" and such things can just as well retard identity development as they can foster it. My own experiences learning physics and working at MIT had solidified the sense that I could only ever be successful by fiercely protecting my independence. I was also lulled by historical narratives of century-old scientists and mathematicians, narratives which depicted them as towering intellects who had single-handedly cleared vast swaths of cognitive jungles. I began to see their lives as proxies of my own and began to downplay the ways I had been helped, indeed the way I had been saved, by others. Coming to Harvard a fear that my identity would dissolve so easily in the toxic solution of casual racism and hostility, I held fast onto what was left of an eroded sense of self. I had to become strong again, supposedly on my own. 

But of course Matthew Reece helped me. Felix and Po yi helped me. Jacob and Lisa helped me. I had survived that first year through a mix of patience and focus, but this survival was made more attainable through people I now only rarely acknowledge. 

We forgive and we provide empathy, not merely because someone else needs it, but because we need it. Because providing such things quells hate, begins to free us from it, and thus makes it possible to face the pain which had erroneously demanded retribution. Retribution is merely a constant return to pain, a reliving of it again and again not only in our own life but in the lives of others. We can become trapped by the conditions that precipitated the pain, believing they are an immutable facet of life and must be responded to even if such conditions do not seem to be apparent in new environments. I still question Ariel's new found concern, but he is right about the assistance another person can provide.

We like to believe that the truth will eventually win out, that truth can be derided and denied but will ultimately emerge unscathed and whole. But the practice of science suggests the truth we find is not completely independent of our perspectives during pursuit. In other words, our answers are inextricably linked to the questions we ask. Ask one question you get one answer and ask another sufficiently different question and you may get an opposite answer.

Introduction to "Missing Curriculum in Problem Solving"
Going through a physics course (not to mention an entire physics undergraduate curriculum) requires solving many problems. The main goal in tasking the student with so many problems is to develop a deeper knowledge of the principles underlying physical phenomena. A secondary goal—and a common reason for why physics majors are even for those who don't intend to become physicists—is that solving physics problems cultivates problem solving ability in general. In this paper I argue that the nature of the problems most commonly assigned makes this latter goal unlikely.

Myth making and Mathematics 
Yesterday I completed Andrew Hacker's "The Math Myth". When I first picked it out of the library I imagined the book would criticize the myth that there were "math people" and "non-math people", that regardless of how much one practiced or worked during his or her life, one's ultimate ceiling of mathematical ability could not be raised. Such thoughts had always came to me whenever I felt outclassed by mathematical luminaries both contemporary and past. To combat these thoughts I sought out egalitarian messages like Lauren Schwartz's comment on how slow he was and how that in the end his processing speed was not fatal to his career. But Hacker's egalitarian message was different. His problem was not with the narratives of mathematical ability but with the way the education system tried to develop mathematical ability. 

He claims here that he did not advocate doing away with algebra, which may be true within the referenced article but is not at all true for this book. "Doing away with algebra" is largely the thesis of his book. 

Hacker's contention is with the onerous mathematics requirements for high school graduation and for the first years of college. One may guess that he disagrees with the current trend of requiring students, who have no intention of majoring in physics, chemistry, or engineering sciences, to take geometry (both euclidean and analytic), trigonometry, and calculus. This guess is somewhat true because Hacker indeed believes these courses are not necessary for the vast majority of students. However, he thinks they are are so unnecessary that he hardly bothers to argue against them. Instead he focuses on the main pre-requisite to all these courses: algebra. At the level of choosing a focal point of an argument, this is a solid strategy. If he can successfully argue requiring students to take algebra does not necessarily fulfill the larger objectives of education, then all the courses that follow algebra are vanquished as a matter of course. But then again if he fails in his argument, although such a failure further solidify an algebra requirement, it does not in turn imply that the later requirements are safe. 

What is algebra? In the K-12 education system, it is the subject concerned with solving for unknown quantities in terms of known quantities. Simply, algebra exists in anything that makes use of the famous variable "x" or its other manifestations. 

Hacker sees algebra as unnecessary because most careers do not require it, but beyond being merely unnecessary, Hacker thinks algebra is actively harming students. In his view, the algebra requirement acts as some arbitrary "great filter" culling from a set of willing and able career aspirants those who cannot do calculations which ultimately have no bearing on the day to day work in said career. The process: To become a [insert credential professional], you (likely) need to graduate from high school and college. To graduate from high school college you have to pass all of your required courses, which often include algebra. Therefore, if you cannot pass algebra you cannot graduate from high school or college and hence you cannot become [credential professional]. The logic seems facile, but Hacker's stories and statistics are damning. 

In determining why students in the Los Angeles Unified School District had such an alarmingly low four-year completion rate (48% of first time 9th graders in the years 2001-02 graduated four years later), David Silver and other researchers found that 63% of the students ultimately failed Algebra I, and students who failed algebra were half as likely (35% vs 70%) to complete high school on time. 

A 2006 CUNY task force on student retention found that 27% of freshmen entering associate programs and 44% entering baccalaureate had graduated six years later. In the task force's view, "Failing mathematics at all levels affected retention more than any other academic factor." Here is a quote from the study [CUNY Task Force on Retention Hunter College]:

Of the 86 courses with the highest fail rates at the senior colleges, 36 of them are math courses (nearly 42%), with the highest numbers in calculus and algebra. Roughly 34% of the “killer courses” at comprehensive colleges are in mathematics (20 out of 59, with the highest number in algebra), and at the community colleges that number is 30% (most of them algebra as well). Out of the 265 “killer courses” identified University-wide, 92 of them are in mathematics, representing 34.71% overall. 


An unstated irony in Hacker's analysis is that much of the data he employs to argue that algebra and its more arcane follow-ups are unnecessary was curated by statisticians for whom algebra was foundational to the more abstruse methods of their discipline. Hacker later decries academic statistics as focusing on Chi-square analysis, linear regressions, and p-values to the benefit of largely no one, and yet much of the data he cites is grounded in such statistical concepts.

Hacker also argues that algebra requirements exacerbate the de facto tracking of students from poor socioeconomic backgrounds into adults of poor socioeconomic status. Both students from wealthy and from poor families struggle with mathematics requirements, but it is only students from wealthy families who are afforded the resources (higher quality schools, tutors, SAT prep camps) that allow them to overcome these hurdles. The students who cannot overcome the mathematics requirement (many of them from families in the lowest quartile of the income distribution) may leave college or high school altogether, thus condemning them to a lifetime of wage servitude and economic disenfranchisement. 

I must admit that before I saw these statistics my personal experience led me to have little identification with Hacker's argument. I took Algebra I in 8th grade (more than a decade ago!), so the idea that Algebra could be a major hurdle to completing high school, let alone college, was rather strange to me. Algebra is much more conceptually simple and immediately applicable to the "real world" than calculus and trigonometry (which themselves are simpler and more immediately applicable than the pantheon of more formal mathematics), so much so that, in my opinion, requiring students to take Algebra I was no more onerous (and no less necessary) than requiring students to take an American History course. But, then again, I went to a technology school for my undergraduate education, a school which requires all students to have finished single and multivariable calculus by the end of their first year. In order to be able to survive such a curriculum, students would have needed to be well prepared by their high school education, many of them having taken single-variable calculus before they set foot on campus. Being able to take calculus in your senior year would mean that one had taken Pre-calculus, Algebra II, and Geometry (in some permutation) in the previous three years and had done sufficiently well in those courses to move on to the next in the sequence. Not everyone has such positive (or at least not-negative) experiences with their mathematics education, so I can acknowledge that my own experience is not representative.

 separating those who can make it past this pointless requirement from those who cannot and only inducting the former into sought for careers, careers in which the requirements ultimately never proves useful.

But while I can acknowledge the statistics, I find issue with other parts of Hacker's argument. In addition to the way algebra adversely affects graduation rates, Hacker sees algebra (and much of higher mathematics in K-12 education) as unnecessary because contrary to popular belief, learning mathematics does not cultivate some general cognitive ability which can be applied to domains outside of mathematics. Hacker cites somewhat dubious evidence to argue this. At one point he uses a list of the top scoring countries in the 2013 International Mathematics Olympiad 

1. China 2. South Korea 3. United States 4. Russia 5. North Korea 6. Singapore 7. Vietnam 8. Taiwan 9. United Kingdom 10. Iran

to argue that mathematics does not improve critical thinking because countries with authoritarian governments (China, Russia, North Korea, Iran) are often amongst the top scorers.  

So what can we conclude about mathematics when its brand of brilliance can thrive amid onerous repression? One response may be that the subject, by its very nature is so aloof from political and social reality that its discoveries give rulers no causes for concern. If mathematics had the power to move minds toward controversial terrain, it would be viewed as a threat by wary states. [pg. 88]

I don't agree that success in the mathematics olympiad is a proxy for all types of mathematical ability. The olympiad tests well students' ability to solve difficult problems quickly using techniques learned from hundreds of previous hours spent practicing such problems. In order to become adept at solving such problems requires a level of forced discipline typically not chosen by students willingly without the coercive efforts of some authority figure, institution or otherwise. So it is perhaps not surprising that authoritarian governments frequently appear in the top scorers list. Moreover, a better proxy for how well a country fosters creative mathematical ability would be how that countries researchers are viewed by the wider mathematical community. Something like Fields medals awarded might be a useful measure, but then someone would have to write a carefully worded essay about the impartial politics of choosing awardees. 

When only considering the black-plus-white population of students taking the SAT (to control for English as a second language issues, Hacker didn't include Asian and Hispanic American students for whom only 30% stated English was the first language they learned), Hacker noted that of the students who scored at least a 700 on the mathematics section, 36% of them also scored above a 700 on the reading section, while in the reverse case the percentage was 44%. His tongue-in-cheek conclusion: "Humanities scholars might well argue that if we want to improve agility in algebra, more time should be spent discussing novels and poems."

I think it would be difficult to use SAT score statistics to establish a causative relationship between mathematics and general cognitive ability. Even if one had found that a high (i.e., +50%) proportion of the 700+ club of mathematics students scored above a 700 in the critical reading section, rather than the reverse, the most we could establish is a correlation between the two scores. In order to prove some causative relationship, we would need some temporal ordering for the scoring. That is we would need a before and after snap shot of critical reading scores where between the before and after the students learned some mathematics. And then even if one did not observe a score increase, the most one could conclude is that learning mathematics did not increase one's critical reading scores in the SAT. Cognitive ability is too large of a domain to say conclusively that learning mathematics improves upon no part of it outside of mathematics. 

For my part I have always believed the "general cognitive ability" argument to be true mostly because I believed I experienced it in my own life. During my sophomore year of high school, I kept a notebook where I practiced writing essays. Over that time I wrote maybe two dozen essays (each  less than 600 words) and although I noted some improvement in my writing during that year, I noticed the largest improvement after I started teaching myself calculus from Apostol's rigorous introductory text. Developing a mathematical subject from principles to techniques using proofs and logical argument was novel to me and ultimately changed how I experienced the world. As I continued to write essays I noticed previously invisible logical gaps in my reasoning. My writing became tighter and I became better able at using dispassionate reasoning to work through a rational question. In other words, learning calculus had improved my writing in ways that Hacker and others say does not occur. 

Now, I realize my story story bears the unreliable flavor of anecdote, and of course simply because I felt as though I experienced a general increase in my propensity for logic and in the tightness of my arguments does not mean such improvements actually occurred. But I think believing these increases occurred certainly counts for something. In a similar sense, it may be difficult to prove that reading literature actually increases the reader's empathy for others, but it is still valuable for a reader to see literature through this lens because doing so raises in the reader the question of when and where empathy should be applied. This empathy may not have been gained from what one has read, but believing it has may lead one to be more cognizant of it in other parts of one's life and thereby lead to it being built in other ways. I think general logical reasoning and mathematics can function in the similar ways. 

With regard to careers, Hacker states that most jobs do not use any mathematics beyond extended arithmetic. His conclusion is that for these jobs students should not be required to learn anything beyond algebra, and should instead obtain more focused coursework in "numeracy", reasoning with numbers. From my own conversations with people who have graduated from college, it appears to be true that most jobs do not require algebra or anything more abstruse. However, I don't think as many people as Hacker believes always knew from high school what careers they wanted to pursue. Having students take algebra is not 

The K-12 education requirements have the dual purpose of preparing students for the workforce and ensuring that future doors of career opportunities are not closed. Not all students decide at 15 to avoid all careers that require higher math, but if one catered to such students by instituting a curriculum limited the mathematics requirement to "numeracy", many less conscientious students who just follow the stated requirements and who have no premature aversion to math (but no premature inclination either) may be cut off from future careers they might ultimately enjoy. 

Must there be a tradeoff between the traumatic experience of one student who never becomes a graphic designer because she fails algebra in one dogmatic curriculum and the lost opportunity of another student who never becomes an engineer because a conciliatory curriculum never required her to take algebra? Maybe. Currently the educational system is bending to cater to the latter student, and Hacker believes this is so problematic that the situation should be reversed. But perhaps a compromise could be achieved? 

Hacker's rebuttal of a rebuttal Edward Frenkel made of his argument reflects the main problems with it. 

The following—which I've slightly abridged—was written by Edward Frenkel, a mathematics professor at University of California's Berkeley campus, shortly after an article of mine appeared. (For the record, I supported retaining algebra, but proposed that alternatives also be offered.)

In a recent op-ed, Andrew Hacker suggested eliminating algebra from the school curriculum and instead teach how the Consumer Price Index is computed. 

What seems to be completely lost on Hacker is that the calculation of the CPI is in fact a difficult mathematical problem which requires deep knowledge of all of the major branches of mathematics including advanced algebra. 

So indulge me for a moment while I show how I show how I used the Consumer Price Index with my own students. I took my cue from Richard Scheaffer of the University of Florida, a former president of the American Statistical Association. "The key to statistical thinking," he has said is in the context of a real problem and how data might be collected and analyzed to help solve that problem." 

Comparing CPI findings for 1994 and 2012, my students and I focused on how and where households in those years were spending their money. We looked at forty-five categories, ranging from fresh fruits and vegetables (down 36 percent) to 'personal care' (up 118 percent). The goal was to deploy numbers to analyze personal and social changes. In our class discussions, a ground rule was that you had to cite figures to support your interpretations. Thus, on one side they found less spending on alcoholic beverages (down 40 percent). On another front there, was a rise in mostly sugary soft drinks (up 18 percent). Now that we knew the figures, how to explain these shifts? 

As we saw, Frenkel sees the CPI in an entirely different light. What interests him are the complex equations used to create the data in the first place and to keep it up to date. Thus in his article he printed out:

[I actually never found such an equation in the referenced Frenkel article, but I'll take Hacker's word that it appeared in some original version.]

This equation, he explained, is used to factor in inflation rates for items ranging from frozen foods to home mortgages. In his view, one can't begin to use the Consumer Price Index without first absorbing enough algebra to parse equations like this one. 

Here's the issue. Frenkel is talking about the mathematics used to setup the CPI and keep it updated. While I acknowledge and appreciate those efforts, my aim is to use CPI's figures to sharpen out understanding of ourselves and our society. I cannot see what's gained in making undergraduates master advanced equations before they can start discussing why Pepsi-Cola is replacing Budweiser. No one would say we can't use out laptops without first studying the chips and circuits behind the screens. 


Hacker wants workers to be critical and responsible in their use of numbers, but limiting their skills to simple numeracy limits their ability to be critical. Knowing how the CPI is calculated does amount to understanding what the CPI measures and without an understanding of the formula and by only manipulating the outputs of the formula (as Hacker claims he teaches his students to do) one is left susceptible to working only within the world created by those who made the formula in the first place. Numbers are not the only things which need to be critiqued: the models which generate those numbers must be analyzed as well. Thus even in analyzing statistics one must be aware of how these statistics were obtained and be prepared to analyze the algorithms used to obtain them. 

As Cathy O Neil, states in weapons of math destruction "Algorithms are opinions embedded in code." The same can be said of formulas, and understanding algebra makes it more likely that one could critique such veiled opinions.

More thoughts on The Math Myth
The more I think about it the more I am enamored by one philosophy of mathematical thinking suggested in Hacker's book. In his view, being able to do complicated algebraic calculations lends no more to increased cognitive ability than does learning the various conjugations of Latin verbs. In this sense mathematicians are no more intelligent than the rest of us; they are just in a profession that requires specialized skills like plumbing or underwater basket weaving. 

I like this philosophy because it forces the person with the supposedly rare mathematical abilities to recalibrate his or her sense of identity. In the space of the rather large number of people who cannot perform the intricate calculations of calculus or formal proof, those who can do such things might develop a sense of superiority. Especially since everyone around them is telling them how incredibly clever they are for being able to understand such an arcane body of knowledge. But if we posit that understanding this body of knowledge does as much to increase general cognitive capacity as any intellectual activity—that is it does not do much to cause such an increase—then we have to admit that those who have this understanding are not any more intelligent. 

This would in turn require them to find a foundation of identity outside of this false sense of superiority. Indeed if you no longer believe that abilities you've acquired with little effort makes you "better than" a vast majority of the population, then you are less likely to enter into the deep sleep of complacency that comes with all spontaneously given privileges. Moreover, you work no longer functions as this thing which separates and distinguishes you from much of humanity. It is instead your own preoccupation, different in kind but not different in personal attachment from the preoccupations of others.

Language and Math
OK From Pinker we can admit that thought precedes language (and not the other way around) and from countless studies on transfer we can admit that learning mathematics does not increase cognitive ability (however measured) in domains unrelated to mathematics. But, from my own experience I know that language can often clarify thought and make it more efficient by giving labels to experiences, which are of course are felt and thought about without such labels, but which acquire greater clarity through these labels. And I know mathematics clarifies quantitative thought by making notions of change and shape example more explicit through calculus and geometry. 

So perhaps neither mathematics nor language fundamentally changes the way humans think or experience the world, but both certainly affect the way we articulate these experiences and these articulations in turn change the way we think about them. Because mathematics is a formal language, we can combine these rebuttals into the single claim that although thought precedes language, language often clarifies thought.

How Humans Learn to Think Mathematically by David Tall

From pg. 43: The biological brain builds fantastic ways of performing calculations based on previous experience, but if that experience is not focused on increasingly subtle techniques of calculation, then a child may continue using old techniques that prove inadequate for more subtle problems. 

This statement follows many sections where Tall gives examples of students doing arithmetic on their fingers. These students seem quite capable and creative in using their fingers to compute things like 15 - 9, but it is clear that reliance on this method, no matter how adeptly the students seem to apply it, places a ceiling on their ability to flexibly manipulate numbers. Tall argues that it is not until students have evolved from the stage in which calculations are explicit "finger counting" processes that they will be able to use these calculations as the conceptual foundations for more complicated tasks in arithmetic and beyond. For example, a student who calculations 6 + 8 by counting out six fingers and then eight fingers to find a thumb left over would successfully obtain 14, but this method would not be applicable to calculating 111 + 57. In order to do the latter calculation, the student has to evolve to the point where the two numbers represent, rather than counting operations, number concepts which have properties, rather than procedures, upon which the summation can be based. 

I think Tall is using this example to argue for the larger point of how learning at one level (for example, learning to count by using one's fingers) can impede learning at a higher level (for example, learning to compute large number summations). The remedy is that Hall states that learning must evolve (although it's not clear how) to encompass a larger set of thinking models for procedural tasks. Hall labels this evolved state as thinking in terms of "procepts" in which calculations like 15-9 exist both as the process of subtracting nine from fifteen but also as the larger concept 6.

The Better Vantage
I once said that "physics is not enough". But then I failed to look and to act further. I failed to try to see what else could exist in the space my work could not fill and to strive to make such things a part of my life. And so it proved all too easy to fall back into old patterns of believing my work could somehow save me, that it could increase my measure in the eyes of the swaths of anonymous strangers I navigate through each day. But if my work is to ever save me, it would be in the way it makes such things irrelevant for it would make me more cognizant of my own value regardless of external estimation, it would be to induce in me an eclipse in which all the identities foisted upon me are obscured by the shadow of a grander and more solid identity I myself have created. That is the dream. That is the hope. But even with this dream achieved, there will remain the fact that I am human and the esoteric order and abstraction of my work can only feed a part of me. Where else, how else, through what else could I be made whole? Moreover, how can I be made whole without relying on another person? These are the questions that govern my waxes and wanes in energy. It is in denial of the relevance of these questions that I find myself lost and afraid, gradually slipping into some hidden dimension of self-marginalization where all I see is how I am seen and all that I am is all that others tell me that I am. But here and now, the question is faced, and from this vantage I can see the prospect for change.

Protein Aggregation
I just spoke to Eugene (post-doc) about protein aggregation. I asked him when proteins form aggregates whether they form these aggregates with a distribution of sizes. He said that it varied for various proteins. Some protein aggregates were limited in size because they formed aggregates through exposed parts of the protein, exposed parts that eventually become less and less exposed as more proteins joined the larger structure. I think crystallin (the protein he studies) was an example of this. For other proteins (like amyloids) he noted that there was no restriction in the size of the aggregate structure. These aggregates can grow and grow indefinitely until they reach the limits of their containers. 

I then asked what determined the sizes of protein clusters (besides the availability of new monomer addition sites). Eugene said he didn't know. If a protein was not very susceptible to nucleation (i.e., the formation of a central protein around which other proteins can bind) then once a single nucleus was formed, other proteins would attach to this central nucleus without any other protein nuclei being created. In other words there would just be one cluster. If a protein was highly susceptible to nucleation, then there could many different clusters. I asked Eugene what determined the sizes of these clusters. He told me he didn't know and that it would in general be hard to measure. One measurement option consisted of sending various clusters through a tube, measuring their diffusion constant, inferring their size and from their size inferring their numbers of proteins. 

In summary, it doesn't seem as though the partition model exactly applies to protein aggregation.

MITES Reflux
It is only the start of the third week of classes and I am already very much "over" the MITES program. The program has consumed much of my energy and attention for the past month. So much so that I haven't done any work towards my many prospective research projects. Nothing towards the "Self Assembly of a Dimer System". No outline of the aggregation of many particles. Nothing towards the statistical physics of generalized derangements. Worse still, is I have three more weeks to go. I am technically not even half done with the course and already I have no desire to return to class for the next two weeks and teach anything to anyone. 

What is the cause of this malaise? Starting the lecture notes to late, for sure. I have had to write and write and write, to try to keep up with the lecture schedule, and what I am experiencing is not a gaining of ground, but rather a loss of one, for although I have currently written past where we are in lecture, with each passing day I write less and less so that there will be some point of intersection when what I present in class will beyond my existing notes. 

I began writing the lecture notes for the course in the last week of May. With any hope I will finish before the last week of June. But I am tired and cranky, and I do not want to continue writing. But I will continue to write. Partly because I realize that this is a cage that I have created for myself, and therefore only I can free myself from it. Apparently, few of my students read my lecture notes, and those who do read them do not always find them helpful. So, in a sense I likely can stop writing lecture notes right now and the course will continue as normal for the students. But the lecture notes were not really ever written for my students. Or they were only written  for my students" in the superficially altruistic way giving to charity is about "contributing to a cause". To be candid, I wanted to write the lecture notes for myself, so I could have a record of statistical physics worked through and developed according to my own sense of how it should be developed. The students learning was auxiliary to this goal, a means to an end rather than the end in of itself. So although I was somewhat surprised to learn that my lecture notes were largely irrelevant to their learning in my course, this knowledge did not change my desire to complete the lecture notes. 

Perhaps this "means" vs, "ends" conundrum is the essence of the problem I'm facing. Teaching was a means to explore my own ideas about the subject and how to learn. But teaching has its own set of technicalities and requires a focus which sees it as more than a path toward something ostensibly better. That has been my mistake. Failing to see this task as worthy in of itself, outside of what I hope it can give to me. 

Of course, with starting the lecture notes late

Quotes from "A Slot Machine; A Broken Test Tube"

… it made clear to me the basic differences between industrial and academic research. The university is a world of scholarship and trust, where the reward for success is intellectual recognition. Industry is a world of contracts and insecurity, where pay is the reward for work, and success may make one expendable. 
- pg 102

Maybe the university for all it's limitations, approximates what an ideal intellectual community should be—a microcosm where shared purpose and mutual respect counterbalance the centrifugal momentum of individual passions and drives.

Introduction to "Self-assembly of a dimer system" paper 

Possibly include in the introduction: 
Viruses mostly consist of protein shells (a container made from protein macromolecules) that enclose highly packed genetic material. What is particularly interesting about such a structure is that, once all the component protein parts exist, the structure appears to assemble spontaneously within a cell, without any external input of work. That is, once one brings all of the individual component proteins of the shell together, then not only do these components manage to find one another and combine into a large structure, they also seem able to distinguish correct from incorrect contacts and \textit{correctly} assemble into the larger structure. It appears that the molecular biology of such virus proteins is so finely turned that the structures almost make themselves.

My Students 

I had my last office hours session as part of MITES 2018. There were fewer students in attendance today than in past weeks because these office hours apparently coincided with elective office hours. But Izabela, Jeramy, Laura, Brian, and Si Young showed up for part of that time. It is odd teaching students. You try to see them as individuals, as who they are apart from you, but you sometimes can't help comparing them to yourself, sort of measuring yourself against them in ways which are not fair and almost always self-congratulatory. 

At these office hours I was guiding Jeramy and Izabela through a problem and after some time I became somewhat frustrated by how dependent they were on me to frame their reasoning for them and to check their answers. We would start with a problem, and they would tell me that they did not know how to begin. I would read the problem statement out loud, and then I would turn to the referenced equation and ask them what it meant, and what we should calculate. They would answer the question, and then we would calculate what they said we should calculate. We would go through this process a number of times. Me pointing to a current step in the calculation and asking them what came next; them answering (often correctly) what to do next and us doing it. Of course, while we were working through the calculation, they made a number of mistakes which reflected a  poor foundation in calculus and the properties of functions. This poor foundation was of course mostly my fault, since Izabela and Jeramy were not "supposed to be" in Physics III given that they were both in Calculus I, but I decided to promote and keep, respectively, them in the course because they expressed interest. So if they are struggling with calculus it is of course because they do not know it. Perhaps I should have been more like Mr. Ferris during my sophomore year, drawing a hard line in the sand between advanced physics and non-advanced physics and only allowing those coming in with calculus to enter. But I had known back then and I know now that the line is a false one, born of the elitism and myopia of an individual who believes that people are only capable of what he himself is capable of. If I could transcend Mr. Ferris's sense of possibility for a student in physics, then surely my own students could transcend my own. 

The verdict is still out on this last point. The students have surprised me a number of times (for example, their quick answer of how to proceed through the second round of the "guess that number" game), but they have also disappointed me a number of times. Earlier last week I was explaining in lecture the partition-function calculation of the mean-field Ising model, and I struggled mightily to pull from them the definition of the microstate for such a system and how one would sum over all microstates. But this is new material, so I suppose this is less concerning than the lack of independence and the poor foundations I noted above. 

So, so far there are three problems I see with some of my students, problems which I think will put a ceiling on their progress in math and physics if they do not fix them. 

First many of them seem to lack independence in their reasoning ability. This could perhaps also be interpreted as a lack of confidence in their ability to get to an answer without the teacher's help. I remember that when I was in high school, I was never so dependent on my physics and mathematics teachers for assistance. How could I be if I ultimately were to teach myself things that they did not know? Early on I became almost detached from the learning experiences framed by my teachers, and I sought to build my own knowledge and my own ways to check that knowledge. This ability has proved so useful to me that it has carried me to today. But of course, simply because a skill is useful to me does not mean it is universally so. Perhaps there is a way that students can proceed through mathematics and physics with the dependent mindset I am disparaging. It was not a path I followed, so I cannot see it, but that does not mean it does not exist. 

Second, many of them lack a thorough grounding in the basic manipulations of algebra. I remember showing Brianna that (a-b)^2 was equal to (b-a)^2 and her looking on in astonishment, apparently never having seen or recognized the truth of this identity before. At another point, a student would square a summation and then drop one of the summations and put the square on its argument, thus reducing the square of a summation to a summation over squares. Jeramy and Izabela also seem to lack a basic recall of some results in calculus like knowing to include the derivative of the function when they are applying the chain rule, but again, this deficiency is likely because they have had less exposure to calculus than their peers. 

Perhaps these mistakes are not as bad as they seem to me. William Byers has this idea that the mistakes students make in mathematics are very much like the mistakes mathematicians made throughout the history of mathematics, and so if students are struggling with a concept like imaginary numbers, rational numbers, or negative numbers it is because these are all difficult concepts given the assumptions people bring in to their analysis. 

So, Brianna should be initially surprised that (a-b)^2 = (b-a)^2 and the confusion about the summation of squares versus the squares of summations is simply an important lesson about the precision of language in mathematics. A
Perhaps, but I cannot help but see that everything in this course would go more smoothly had students been experts in the pre-requisites. Largely, all we are doing is applying these prerequisites repeatedly in novel ways and new contexts, and so if these prerequisites had been well learned, the students would not be as confused as they are. 

The third problem is related to the second. It concerns what educators term "transference", the ability to apply a learned concept to a new domain. Many times, throughout my lectures and problem sets, I would write out a short calculation only for the students to look on confused and be completely clueless as to how I got the result I claimed to be true. As a way of explanation, I would rewrite the result without the physical baggage, emphasizing the crucial mathematical element and then ask them if they were still confused. They would shake their head (indicating no), having recognized the truth of them mathematical statement outside the context of physics. Today for example I wrote

partial/partial beta (ln Z) 

on the board and Jeramy looked at me blankly and told me he did not know what this meant. Then I wrote 

d/dx ln f(x)

 and he understood. He ultimately got the calculation wrong (a deficiency in basics), but at least he understood what it meant and from there I could explain to him how it was essentially identical with the first calculation. In another occasion I was integrating a constant function (simply 1) over a finite domain. The integration variable was x_1 and I was integrating from x_0 to x, and many students could not see the answer. Then I switched x_1 to x, x_0 to a, and x to b, and all of a sudden the students knew what they were looking at and what the answer was. I suppose all of my simplifications were sort of power moves, various ways of saying "Can't you see how simple this is? Look at this trivial example. I defy you to tell me that you still do not understand."

I was often frustrated to see how limited their sense of mathematics was. Students believed the index of a summation was an important aspect of defining the sum, and they were reluctant to move derivatives into the summation or past integrals defined by different variables. I was trying to teach them new material, but the foundation upon which that new material was supposed to be built was cracked and full of holes. I think the most concrete benefit many students got from this course was a reorganization and a deepening of their knowledge of algebra and calculus. 

I suppose I am OK with this. Students need not necessarily take away from your course what you wished them to take away. They take away what is most important and useful to them, and you as a teacher have to be OK that they learned something. 

I should mention not all of the students in this class lack independence, a good grounding in the basics, or the ability to transfer obtained knowledge to knew domains. Laura and Si Young are both fairly independent. Laura received one of the highest scores on the diagnostic and so her grounding in the foundations is superb, as is most of her work. She has never asked me a question about how to start of complete a calculation. Instead, most of her questions concern some typo I have made in the notes or lecture which has confused her and led her astray. Many other students are, in comparison, almost child-like in their reasoning ability. Tentative, unsure, and always looking towards authority to check their work. 

But these students are growing and changing. Simply because they are unlike me or unlike the better students in the class does not mean they are doomed to some lower echelon of achievement in their desired field of work. But I still feel the urge to push them along faster, to tell them of the ways that their dependence might handicap them in the future. I see this degree of dependence in Victor, in the way he looks to Eugene for direction and instruction, and this dependence certainly is not helping him. But then again perhaps this is just another way to live a life, a way that I have not chosen for myself, but which is no less worthy a life than my own.

Neat and careful explanations throughout assignment. Came up with an original way to organize the complicated calculation/simplification of the entropy of a two state system. Placed the same number next to the terms which canceled so she could explicitly keep track of what terms remained in the equation. Something that students don't recognize the necessity of until they enter undergrad. The final answer was not correct however. Did not calculate the force correctly due to algebraic mistakes. Misinterpreted the objective of the Taylor expansion question.

Notes from Meeting with Eugene
— Phase diagram: Using various parameter choices, with temperature, energy gap, n (number of copies) 
— Conditions under which you have all correct combinations
— Don't have to work through results analytically. 
— Fixed number of copies (but change the number of types): When you increase the number of types when do they start to misinteract? Places a limitation the number of types of proteins. 
— Antigen Antibody binding 
— George Benedek, protein aggregation distribution, inelastic light scattering
— Pileak, UNC, used NMR to asses sizes of protein complexes.

MITES 2018 Post-Script 

From May 22nd until August 6th, I wrote 124 pages of notes, 26 pages of assignments, and 64 pages of assignment solutions for the MITES statistical physics course. I tried (but failed) to follow the advice I gave myself last year: Finish the notes, assignments, and solutions well before the start of the program. Instead, like last year, I ended up writing notes concurrently with my teaching, and as a result, these notes were rushed and riddled with mistakes. and I constantly found myself exhausted by the end of the week. I had no time to do any real research, to work on my thesis, or to think deeply about anything other than teaching, and as a result I began to resent my teaching duties. The resentment started early within the first week of classes, crested during the second week, and remained at a steady unconscious high until the end of the program. I resented the fact that I was being paid less than I felt I deserved. I resented the students' license on my time. I resented their confusions and the gaps in their mathematics background.

</div>

Gone was any sense of the larger picture, any notion of the main reason I was teaching. Ten years ago I took physics for the first time at MITES and my life was changed as a result. Hyun, now a professor across the ocean in the Netherlands, was between his 2nd and 3rd years of graduate school at the time and he quietly, but rather unambiguously, pushed me further along a path that I still follow to this day. If he could change me in ways he likely did not and does not realize, might I be able to affect a similar change in my students? This question was, at the core, what inspired me to return to MITES as an instructor. At least for the summer of 2017. For the summer of 2018, I was spurred on by financial insecurity to do something more lucrative even if it was somewhat detached from my own educational history. But my proposed course "Methods of Theoretical Biophysics" had only a single student enrolled by March, so the organizers of Harvard's Pre-College Summer Program had to cancel the course. 

I turned to MITES as a way to save myself. I should have made contingency plans and sought out a summer position that I was as interested in as I was teaching in the Pre-College Program. But such are the casualties of hubris. Faced with the prospect of no summer income, I sent Reimi a sheepish email wondering if I could return again for another summer, and in my confirmation of the position, I made one decision which was atypical in its wisdom: I surmised that I was too young to rest on my laurels and so instead of teaching the same course I taught last summer, I proposed that I teach a new one. Did I have a syllabus? No! Did I have a single word of lecture notes written? Hah! Still, I felt confident that all these things would be worked out eventually if not painlessly. 

I can say the decision was wise because now that I am on the other side of it, I can with equanimity appreciate the ways I have grown without combating the constant distraction of actively fostering that growth. I understand statistical physics better than I ever have. In particular, I filled the embarrassing and largely unconscious gap in my knowledge concerning the explicit relationship between free energy and the second law of thermodynamics. Also, I think I managed to wrangle a new research problem from one of my assignments. And best of all, I now have a complete set of personal notes on statistical physics that I can re-use again and again until I decide to get off my intellectual ass and re-work the subject. It is without a doubt true that the best way to learn a subject is to teach it. I will have to remember this when next I want to learn something new. 

This post-script is supposed to be filled with statements about the lessons I have learned through all this. What have I learned which is different from what I claimed to have learned last year? I can divide these lessons into two categories: Lessons I learned about my students and lessons I learned about myself. 

Student Problems

Deductive Steps and Pre-requisites
I don't think the problems that I assigned this year were more difficult than those I assigned last year. In fact, because of how challenging last year's problems were for the students, I decided to make this year's problems easier than I otherwise would have. Still, however, many students struggled with them. On some level the students' struggles were born from insufficient mathematics foundation, and I say mathematics rather than physics because the beginnings of the course featured mostly exercises in probability and calculus. But beyond pre-requisites, most students seemed to lack a general dexterity and confidence in their mathematical deductions. When explaining how to complete the square, Tomisin remarked that he knew how to do the calculation with numbers, but he did not know how to extend the calculation to variables. Other students understood change of variables formulas on some level, but could not apply it to the calculation of a Gaussian integral. In another circumstance, a student (actually, many students) who apparently knew how to apply the chain rule to compute the derivative of a logarithm did not know how to apply it to the case where the logarithm was a function of temperature rather than position. Or if the student did know how to compute the derivative, he or she still had to be led through each step of the calculation because it was unclear to them what to do next.

I do not really understand why the students were having these problems since I had never had them myself, but I do have some guesses as to their respective sources. The students might have had the mathematical pre-requisites to an extent that allowed them to pass their high school courses and the relevant problems on the physics diagnostic, but these students did not know how to apply these pre-requisites flexibly. This is the classic problem of transference in education: student who learn how to do a task in one circumstance, often find it difficult to apply what they have learned in a new circumstance.

With regard to students who needed to be led through a calculation, it is perhaps because the students did not know what questions to ask themselves to move forward. Perhaps the deductive steps I asked the students to take were larger or more complex than those they were accustomed to, and so while their mind was searching for a simple step they remained blind to the slightly more involved step the problem required. And of course, if you spent most of your working life climbing up steps six-inches in height, no one should be surprised if you trip when encountering a one-foot step. 

Documenting these issues is all well and good, and having recognized them the fixes are apparently simple: If insufficient pre-requisites are a major problem, I can just tailor the diagnostic to screen the students without the necessary mathematical background. Or, I could reconfigure the course to spend even more time on building up these prerequisites from the beginning. Also, if students are only comfortable making small deductive steps, I can assign simple-step problems at the beginning of the class and gradually stretch the students abilities over the summer/semester by assigning problems with multiple unstated steps. 

There are problems with these fixes. I'll detail the problem with tailoring the diagnostic to screen "undesirable" students later (spoiler alert: How do you know you metric for who is desirable is a good one?), but I can discuss problems with the other two now. With a large class, there will always be students of varying prior preparation, interest, and that insidiously ambiguous quantity that we can often do no better than to call "ability". Focusing the early parts of the class on building pre-requisites that students arguably should have had before they entered the course makes the course an easier transition for these students, but why should they be catered to over the students who are more prepared. Clearly a balance is in order, and it is one with no hard rules. I think I bored some students in the beginning by going over combinatorics and probability for one more lecture than I initially planned. But at the same time, I think the general atmosphere of the class benefited from having a shared collection of combinatorics problems that we could all refer to as we built up more sophisticated material. 

The problem with assigning simple-step problems at the beginning of the class is that it sets the wrong tone and expectations for a course which is supposed to be challenging. Perhaps this statement applies to MITES classes in particular rather than classes in general, but students should not necessarily find a continuity of difficulty between their prior classes and their current classes. The difficulty of the course should be set by the difficulty of the subject matter of the course and not by the spectrum of student pre-requisites. This claim is certainly a philosophical position rather than one grounded in a clear eyed assessment of good pedagogy, but then again aren't all claims about how students should be educated essentially claims grounded in philosophy? Also, I think the students really benefited from my presenting statistical physics at a higher level than what they would encounter in a high school course. On some level it showed I respected their intelligence and that I was not going to bullshit them by presenting the subject in a largely pre-digested form. 

There is a conclusion somewhere in all this, but I am not exactly sure what it is. Maybe, I should keep doing what I'm did this summer but now I will do so with a better sense of the potential problems. By all means assign problems which require students to use their knowledge flexibly and make multiple independent deductive steps. But you should do so with the knowledge that many students will find such problems impossible to complete on their own. 

Then again, I think I can and should do better than just outlining the problem. Here are the questions: How do you teach students so that they can flexibly apply their knowledge to new situations? And how can you teach students to make deductive mathematical derivations on their own? 

Edge Students 

Last summer the only student who was on the edge of being admitted into Physics III was Brejah. She had never taken calculus before, and although her knowledge of mechanics was solid, her lack of assurance in mathematical work was evident. After her initial problem set, I made the decision to move her to Physics II. At the end of the summer, the Physics II instructor told me she probably would have been fine in Physics III. I was not so sure. 

This summer I wanted to explore the other route. Three students (Leodson, Izabela, and Brianna) were right below the diagnostic score cutoff for admittance into Physics III. In a previous year, I would have just placed them in Physics II, but I wanted to explore the possibility that they could do well in Physics III. I should mention that none of these three students had requested to be placed in Physics III. If they had, then the decision to move them would have been easy: If a student expresses a desire to be in a class, I assume he or she will do the work necessary to stay in the class. This assumption might be too generous for all high school students, but it is an assumption that I wish various adults had made for me when I was in high school. 

(*Kidus, a student who left MITES in the middle of the summer because he violated the drug policy, did ask to be in the course and I let him in even though he scored about 20 points below the cutoff. He was one of the most engaged students in the class, asking many questions and volunteering answers. I am curious to know how he would have performed.)

Because none of these students had requested to be placed in Physics III, Jason Necaise (the TA for the course) asked them about their interest in taking the class and only after they affirmed their interest, we placed them in the course. 

Immediately these students started to struggle. Another student (Jeramy) who was not near the diagnostic cutoff also began to struggle because although he knew enough calculus to perform OK on the relevant part of the physics diagnostic, his calculus knowledge was quite shoddy. Jason did a lot of work scheduling personal tutoring for these students, but six-weeks is too short of a time to build pre-requisites that often take a year to acquire. It appeared then that the somewhat arbitrary diagnostic cutoff for Physics III was a reasonable one, and these students were in fact not academically prepared to be in the class. 

That is one side of the story: If your goal is to ensure the students have relatively smooth academic experience, you should only accept students who you absolutely know are prepared to take your course. And yet, although Izabela and Brianna struggled throughout the course, they both told me at the end how much they enjoyed the class. Brianna said she found the ideas in the class fascinating and Izabela said she thought the ways ideas were logically built up was intellectually satisfying. Leo and Jeramy on the other hand never seemed to move sufficiently beyond their mathematical difficulties to be able to enjoy the experience of learning something new. Perhaps a male-centered ego had tied their interest and curiosity so tightly to their performance that they could not appreciate the ideas which lay in the background beyond the material they had not yet mastered?

This is why the question of whether to tailor the diagnostic to screen "undesirable" students is a difficult one. Who is a desirable student? One who has all the tools and background to do well in the course? Or one who will be challenged by the course and have their conception of science consequently expanded? Or one who will benefit from  stretching them self in a direction they had never stretched before? What this mini-social experiment has left me with is the knowledge that these situations can go multiple ways. 

If a student is accepted into a course without the necessary pre-requisites then the student will likely struggle, but perhaps the student will still find the course to be a positive experience. 

Higher Level Problems 

This summer I only assigned a single "What is the question?"-type problems. I now have a better sense of why these problems are so difficult to assign. As a physics teacher, you want to make sure your students understand and can apply the technical material so you naturally gravitate to assigning the archetypal problems of the subject matter. When composing the problem sets, there were many technical problems that I thought the students should absolutely solve and when I included all these problems in the problem set, I didn't have space to include a "What is the question?" problem. 

At the time, I often could not even think of such problem. In retrospect, I can now think of appropriate question-type problems for each assignment, but the issue would still remain that I would probably have chosen a technical exercise over this kind of problem. 

Why is that? It is not true that these problems can only be assigned at the end of the course when students have sufficiently built up their technical knowledge to phrase questions in the language of the subject. Such questions can always be framed given the technical knowledge students currently possess. So why assign technical single-answer questions over the more open-ended questions more representative of how science is done? 

My guess is that it has to do with control and risk. Asking the students to ask and answer a question for themselves forces you to give the students control over their own education and risk the possibility that they ask themselves a trivial question which contributes less to their education than even a technical question would. 

But this risk is inevitable. In fact this risk is the entire point of the "What is the question?"-type problems. You are giving students the freedom to construct their own understanding and with this freedom comes the inevitable possibility that they will do something that you did not foresee. The student might ask a simple question which does not respect the complexity of the system they are given, but they might also ask a deeply interesting question that you yourself did not anticipate. 

So recognize that this uncertainty is the entire point of having the students work on "What is the question?"-type problems. How you deal with the uncertainty of relinquishing control over an assignment problem is just as important as how students deal with the uncertainty of having to ask and answer their own questions. 

Personal

Balance
If this summer—like the last one—were to be seen as a test case in my ability to balance teaching and other projects, then the summary conclusion would be a negative one. I failed to balance anything and instead focused the brunt of my energy on teaching. I did not work on my research. I did not start on my thesis. I did not write any personal essays. From May 22nd until the first week of August, my mind was focused entirely on the course.

Maybe this is not as big of a problem as it seems. I previously realized that it is difficult for me to switch between multiple unrelated projects in a single day's or a single week's work cycle. Instead I have found it to be much more productive to work on projects in blocks, with multiple weeks being devoted to one main task until it is complete, and only then switching to a new task. Was I not simply implementing this philosophy in my teaching? 

Not exactly. The way this block-work is supposed to go is that there is indeed one-main project, but there are also secondary projects that you think about and work on a little each week. Clearly, you cannot invest in them the level of energy that is given to the main project, but you should give them enough attention that they grow a little each week. That type of balancing is what I failed to do this summer. I felt so stressed and scatterbrained by my plans for the Statistical Physics course that I did not make time to cultivate the intellectual space to think about anything else.  

Over the next few months, I will be facing a similar situation. I have papers to write and finish, post docs to apply to, a dissertation to draft. Is it not likely, nay inevitable, that I will fall into bad habits and push from my mind anything not relevant to theses tasks? No. I know that I am capable of balance. I managed to spend a lot of time with Neal this summer and although my mind was sometimes on my work when I was with him, we still managed to have several good nights together. But I made time for Neal because we are in a relationship and I felt an ever present responsibility to that relationship that I do not always feel to my secondary projects. If I neglect Neal, our relationship will end sooner or later, but what will happen if I neglect the work I intend to do? The consequences are abstract and uncertain and thus I feel no deep motivation to avoid them. 

But writing this now, I see the consequences more plainly. This discussion is one of the longest pieces I have written in months and it is a struggle to compose. All those weeks of writing lecture notes has made my prose stilted and awkward. I now hesitate at crossroads of word choice that I would have quickly navigated months ago. I write a sentence, a paragraph, a page, and instead of the period swell and settle of emotion I feel an ever present vacuum. Something inside me has become dry and desiccated from neglect and so, of course, now that I come requesting fruit, it has nothing to give. 

This is the consequence of failing at the task of balance. The things you value outside the project at hand gradually whither away until they are gone and you have nothing to return to when your task is complete. Isn't this the contention I had with Tony? with Amy? You cannot neglect dreams or people and expect them to remain as they are when you decide to return to them. 

Therefore, this task of finding balance is a serious one. I am eight months into the year and I have managed to complete some of the goals I set for myself, but other goals remain remote. I need to return to my personal projects list, and build for myself a new schedule of work, one which respects the major goals and the minor ones, and does not neglect one need through an in-artful prioritization of another. 

Depth 

Related to the question of balance is one of depth. One cannot write 200 pages in two months while also patiently poring over the details of one's work or of one's life. One has to skim a bit and walk away from the questions which require time and patience to yield answers. But perhaps this is for the best. Preoccupation with life's minutiae is not really healthy no matter how much of a deeper understanding of yourself you think you walk away with. But there is a spectrum between the static rumination that leads to suicide and the oblivity of the incessant actor that leads to a personal death of a more philosophical kind. 

However, I did quite a bit of solid publicly accessible work during these past few months. Was it not better to do this work than to write a few thousand extra words in a journal that no one will see? I would reflexively say yes, but here I am writing about something that I have lost in the interim and wondering how I can get it back. I have spent so much of my life thinking about and planning to do things that I must say it is deeply gratifying to finally be doing them. But at the same time, I think that all my quiet and subtly uncomfortable over so many nights over so many years have made me who I am and will continue to shape me. They give me a space apart from my work and apart from the public conversation of the wider world. They exist as both lens and respite, allowing me to see things I would otherwise prefer to ignore and to also take a break from seeing the things that everyone else claims is important. 

It is the calm and the quiet and the isolation which cultivates these moments of deep engagement with one's life, one's work, the world, and the spaces in between. It is easier to not be engaged, easier to run headlong into a future one is impatient to see, but it is only easier for a while.  Refusing to look carefully at yourself does not protect you from the consequences of that life; it just makes it inevitable that the lessons those consequences can impart are forever hidden from view.

August 14, 2018 — Tuesday 5:29 PM

I missed the nomination deadline for the Harvard Junior Fellow program. The first thing to do is to admit that the mistake is mine. I did not check the dates for the fellowships, and so I did not know when to tell Eugene to submit a nomination. This fact has been unusually difficult for me to accept. Instead my initial reaction was anger at Eugene. If he were a more attentive advisor he would have been more on-top of the nomination deadlines and would have submitted one without my asking him to. And yet, wasn't his inattention the primary reason our working relationship has gone so smoothly. I could not have exercised the independence I have exercised up to this point had Eugene been as engaged with my life and work as other advisors had been. So, if I were to place the responsibility of missing the nomination on Eugene's shoulders, then by intellectual consistency I should have recognized this as a possibility given aloof ways I have navigated our prior relationship. 

But, again, it was not Eugene's responsibility to know these dates; it was mine. Something in me feels like this mistake is catastrophic and in some way it is true. For the longest time, I unconsciously harbored the dream that I would become a junior fellow, and I languished in the dream for so long that I had missed entirely my opportunity to realize it. And so what is lost is not my future in toto but the dream of a future. Two years ago, I wrote about how one could become hemmed in by dreams, how one can cultivate a dream for so long that one forgets to take steps towards its realization. It seems I have still failed to learn the folly in this tendency, but more so it seems another danger was invisible to me. The way time can seem to so quickly slip away and that the moments when you must act and think and do whatever you need to in order to get to where you want to be can pass by as surreptitiously as clouds in the night. 

From the junior fellowship, I wanted the prestige and the money. The money so I could more securely help my family. The prestige so I could be better set up to pursue other faculty or non-faculty jobs in the future. But missing this deadline is useful and good for me. It should make me more attentive about the future fellowship deadlines. Here is a list of some of the fellowships I would like to apply to

I know how prestige works and for all my claims to the contrary I am perfectly willing to use it to get what I want. 

What does it mean to understand?

You're sitting in class and the teacher says something insightful. A peer nods her head in agreement. A moment of increased understanding seems to have occurred. What cognitive change occurred to lead to that moment? 

You are reading through a book on classical mechanics and completing most of the problems.  What type and level of understanding should you pursue to best learn the subject? How do you know when you've achieved this type and level of understanding? Would the standards be different for a less physically familiar subject like quantum mechanics?

Person A reads Brian Greene's An Elegant Universe. Person B reads and works through Zwiebach's A First Course in String Theory. Person C reads and works through Polchinski's String Theory, Vol. I. All complete their studies and claim to have understood string theory. In what sense are they right and in what sense are they wrong? How does their understanding compare to that of a string theory researcher in the mid 1980s?

Next week, we will discuss what it means to understand a subject in science. Here the focus is not on what it means to understand the physical world itself, but rather what it means to understand the theories we use to understand that world. Feynman notoriously said that no one understands quantum mechanics? Is this an exaggeration, or something deeply true of all theories of the physical world?

Self-Assembly Writing 

I am currently engaged in the slow and humbling process of writing up my results on the self-assembly of a dimer system. It is slow because I am unfocused, and it is humbling because I am constantly being confronted with my deep ignorance of biological phenomena. But I have to say I enjoy the process, perhaps because having to write up these results allows me to everyday bask in the glory of work done seemingly by another person. That time in November when I was lost in the weeds of theory and seeking a way to study the favorable contact model with dissociation: It all now seems so foreign, as if the journey was taken many years ago and I am profiting from the commitments of another. 

I remember I was also rather unfocused at that time, chasing Guan, Elana, and Courtney in various amorous directions that all ultimately lead to cul-de-sacs. In ways I could not articulate then, I was despairing over the loss of Amy and over the loss of my idea of our relationship. Upon reflection we were not the couple I thought we were and I was not as "lucky" as I thought I was to have her. She was manipulative in her subtle way, selfish without seeming self-centered, childish but with the public-confidence of an adult. I loved her (or, at least, I thought I did), and, so, I was scared to lose her. Of course I lost her anyway and I had begun to do so long before she left to Brazil. Each fight, each passive-aggressive move, each unremarked upon silence was an incremental slipping away, so that when the time came for her to travel to the southern hemisphere it was as if she had already left months before. 

I did not try to disappear myself into my work, partly because it was becoming increasingly clear that the direction I had intended to walk was a false one. There was one paper I had wanted to write at that time, but I also felt this nagging sense of intellectual incompleteness, the sense that the paper would be fine as written but that it's premises were unfounded or at least artificial. I can't remember when I realized this. All I remember is that on some August day when Amy was packing for her trip, I sat with her wondering aloud what the title of my next paper should be. The title was apparently the only thing I needed to seriously think about because all the grunt work had all been done. Simulations: Complete. Analytical work: Complete. Experimental Comparison: Incomplete, but surely quite easy. And then there was the two months of work when I realized that the experimental comparison was not at all easy and that if I intended to properly solve the problem I had posed to myself I would have to begin from the ground up constructing new models of association and dissociation. 

The night I completed the final step in deriving the system partition function was the night of an LGBTQ mixer. I left early feeling awkward and ashamed for having gone only to see Guan (who was not there). I walked home, contemplating the combinatorial results I had obtained a few days earlier. By this point I had found an integral expression for one of the combinatorial quantities and believed that writing down the partition function would follow as a matter of course. 

Reflecting on that time, I realize that my progress forward was dependent only partly (and not even mostly) on my knowledge of the analytical methods in statistical physics and combinatorics. Rather, what made it possible to move forward was the ability to formulate specific questions as means to articulate my confusion. Even though the questions are laid out logically and almost trivially in the paper, finding them at the time was incredibly difficult and required many weeks of attention. I think someone with more highly developed analytical abilities would have progressed more quickly through the calculations than I did, making fewer mistakes, recognizing immediately what sub-steps were necessary for a derivation of the partition function. But, I also think it would have been difficult to know exactly what steps should be taken had not one been able to reason out the necessary sequence of questions.  

The questions you ask are reflections of what you value and of the precision of your thinking. Years ago I realized that the ability to formulate and answer your own questions was a key element in becoming an independent physicist. It feels good to have that realization vindicated through my own experiences.

Starting Over
How do you know when what you have been taught provides sub-optimal archetypes for understanding the world? I imagine this question has general importance in life, but I am more interested in its bearing on physics. When I spoke to Rostam about the self-assembly work, his immediate impulse was to use the law of mass action to solve the central of correct and incorrect dimer assembly. This is the very same approach that Zhang used in his or her paper "Constraints imposed by non-functional protein-protein interactions on gene expression and proteome size." The results of a law of mass action approach are somewhat similar to those of the statistical mechanics approach to the problem (namely, both seem capable of predicting the  constraint on the system where Δ is the binding-energy advantage for correct interactions), however the statistical mechanics approach is unsurprisingly more specific because it begins from the granular starting point of a finite number of interacting particles rather than a theoretically infinite number of particles. 

I should state that the problem as I have posed it is different from the problem as it appears in Zhang's paper and Rostam's conceptualization. While I am considering a system with  different monomers each of which has a correct binding with one other monomer in the system, Rostam and Zhang consider a solution of monomers of indeterminate copy number and indeterminate identity which can have correct or incorrect bindings in the system. Written in terms of my notation where monomer species are denoted  for $j=1, …, N$, the premise of the approach Zhang takes states that  is the concentration of correct dimers and  is the concentration of incorrect dimers. The total concentration of the  monomers is then equivalent to the sum of the concentrations of the correct dimers, incorrect dimers, and monomers.



 This focus on concentrations is one major difference between our two formalisms and is why Zhang is able to focus on a single monomer species rather considering all monomers. .  Taking  to be the binding energy of the correct dimer and  to be the binding energy of the incorrect dimer leads to the simple law of mass action expressions 





where  = 1 M by apparent convention. One problem with this approach is that it is too effective and thus does not make specific reference to particle properties like mass. Consequently, the de Broglie wavelength does not enter and it is impossible to derive the two temperature scales which categorize dimer self assembly. Also, concentrations are only accurate representations of a system for very many particles. For fewer particle systems, we would expect deviations from the concentrations predicted by the the law of mass action and we could only calculate the size of those deviations with statistical mechanics. 

All these criticisms extend from my vantage point of having used statistical physics to solve the problem. My approach seems logically straight forward so the natural question is why had no one done it before? The mathematics is not abstruse and the problem is easy to state, so it is not a matter of technical difficulty. Rather I think this problem falls into that small overlap between problems that chemists are interested in and problems that are mathematically tractable. Further complicating the issue is that if you are a chemist who is interested in the problem, you would likely approach it using the law of mass action rather than trying to solve for it statistical mechanically, and this would be true even if you had taken a statistical mechanics course and you know what the Boltzmann distribution is etc. 

I did not answer the question that began this essay: How do you know when the archetypes you learned through your science training are sub-optimal for particular problems? How do you find and learn new archetypes which are more appropriate? 

Like most philosophy of science questions, this question likely does not have an absolute answer. Instead, I venture a guess. I think as a first pass, it is always best to try to solve a problem using the methods and the techniques you know. This first pass establishes a foundation which, even if you decide not to build upon it, can be used as a case for comparison for future work. When I first started working on these dimer models last year, I also first tried applying the law of mass action to calculate concentrations but realized that these general laws failed to precisely reflect the combinatorics of the system. This failure was important in pushing me in a new direction. 

So, what is important is trying the methods you already know and recognizing when they are not completely achieving the objective you seek. From here, the dissatisfaction can pull you into the forest of the literature leading you to look for new methods or new ways to frame the problem, but the dissatisfaction must come first. So, recognizing that your problem archetypes are sub-optimal for a chosen problem partly requires you to have a way to evaluate problem solutions such that you at least have a sense when they are coming short. 

Also, beyond recognizing the inadequacy of your methods, it is likely helpful to know how others have solved the problem. It might not be the case that you think their methods are better than yours, but knowing their work and having done your own you at least become cognizant of a diversity of approaches to your problem of interest. 

[//]

I'm somewhat dissatisfied with the above discussion. Here is a second attempt.

How do you know when your problem archetypes are sub-optimal for the problem you seek to solve? Generally, you don't know. If in an attempt to solve a problem you have exhausted your known problem archetypes, then any other problem archetypes exist in the space of unknown unknowns, subject matter about which you are both ignorant and meta-ignorant. In order to seek out such hidden spaces of knowledge requires one to come to the edge of one's own knowledge. A metaphor is helpful here. If you are in a valley surrounded by hills, then looking out from your vantage point you see a scenery is easy to articulate. You see the patch of grass, the rocks, and the flowers within the valley and all of these things make up the things you know about the valley. But at the same time, you can see the plains rising up to hills which constitute the end of the valley. You know that you have never been up to the hills, so you know that you don't know what you can see from them. Thus, the view from the hills make up all the things you know that you don't know. Beyond the hills there could be an ocean, a desert, or some other geographic landscape unlike anything you have ever encountered in the valley. Such landscapes would represent unknown unknowns because not only have you not seen them, you also do not have the experience to know that they exist. 

Having unknown unknowns requires us to have a frame in which our ignorance is demarcated by past experiences. From our past experiences we do not learn everything about the world, but we learn ways to learn about the world and we use these ways as metrics of knowledge. Thus when we encounter something in our surroundings which fail to satisfy our experientially gained metric of understanding, then we can clearly say that we do not "know" this something. But unknown unknowns are the things which exist beyond our metric. They constitute new experiences which violate our expectations and force us to change our metrics to incorporate these new experiences as possibilities. If I show you a card from a 52 card deck, then you know the card. But if I put a card behind my back, then you know there is a card behind my back, but you don't know the card, and you know that you don't know the card. But if I put the card behind my back, then, as a magic trick, replace it with a teddy bear, and then show you the bear, then you must admit that you did not know the object behind my back and that you realize that you didn't know the object behind my back.

The nature of unknown-unknowns is that they can only be acknowledged as such in retrospect. Only after an unknown-unknown has become a known-known or at least a known-unknown can we acknowledge that we had never envisioned it was a possibility. 

Seeking out better problem archetypes than one's current wheelhouse of archetypes requires one to acknowledge one's ignorance in solving a problem, to try to fill in that ignorance with study, and then to use the new vantage point gained from the study to see what better archetypes exist.

Difference between Proofs and Derivations

What is the difference between proofs as they appear in formal mathematics and derivations as they appear in physics? I am asking this question because I am trying to learn mathematical analysis, a subject in which the main learning outcome is a knowledge of the theorems and the proofs of single and multivariable calculus. I have spent my later academic career doing derivations in physics. What else do I need to learn (or what do I need to unlearn) in order to complete proofs in analysis? 

One reason I might suspect that I don't need to learn much more is because of quotes like this (from How to Think about Analysis by Laura Alcock):

Analysis, like much undergraduate pure mathematics, can be understood as a theory: a network of general results linked together by valid logical arguments known as proofs. 

This is the exact description of a theory in physics. In my first lectures for the Introduction to Oscillations and Waves and the Introduction to Statistical Physics, I always emphasized the network picture of physics, one in which all the predictions of a subject were connected in some way and were logically built up from the foundational principles. However, if a physicist were to repeat Alcock's quote he or she would probably use the word "derivations" in place of proofs. Does this replacement represent a substantive difference between the two methods of logical deduction? 

Let us assume for the moment that when we construct a proof, we are "proving"something and vice versa. Namely, proving results in mathematics is inextricably connected to the generation of proofs, and similarly deriving results in physics is inextricably connected to the generation of derivations. 

This might seem to be a trivial distinction, but the end of chapter problems in pure mathematics books suggest otherwise. When discussing the structure of mathematics, mathematicians (like Alcock and Hammack in How to Think about Analysis and Book of Proof respectively) state that it consists of four things: axioms, definitions, theorems, and proofs. Underneath theorems are propositions and lemmas which are like them but not sufficiently important. The standard claim is that a proof is a justification of a theorem. However, in end of the chapter exercises students are asked to prove results which do not at all appear to be the standard theorems of the subject. If the student succeeds in completing the exercise and proving the result, can she be said to have constructed a "proof" or is the result too disconnected from the core of the subject to be considered a justification of a theorem? 

Maybe this is a moot and pedantic question whose answer is an obvious yes, but perhaps it also makes clear that the main question we're asking (namely, what is the difference between derivations and proofs) is one extending from language and its interpretation. The word "proof" can appear to clearly be the noun form of the word "proving" but if the two words are used in different contexts or if one context is wider than the other, they can seem to mean different things. 

Once could say that there is no real difference between "proving" something in mathematics and "deriving" something in physics because each word is used synonymously with the word "show". For example, in Chapter 2 Section 6 of Analysis by Munkres  there is the following exercise:

9. Let  be a function of class . Show that 
.  

The method of showing the above claim to be true uses all of the same methods used in proving prior results, such that the interpretation of the exercise would not be greatly changed had the word "Show" been replaced by the word "Prove." In another exercise (in Chapter 5 of Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis), the author asks the reader to prove a result which could have just as well been phrased as a "show" problem:

Suppose  is defined and differentiable for every , and  as . Put . Prove that  as 

For analysis texts, then, "show" appears to be synonymous with "prove".

Now, let's consider a physics text. In Griffiths Quantum Mechanics (1995) the word "Show" is used in various problems. For example, in problem 2.45 the first part requests 

Show that 

satisfies the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for the harmonic oscillator potential…

One can imagine replacing the word "Show" with "prove" with no change to the problem interpretation. Indeed, throughout Chapter 2 of the text, the word "show" appears many times followed by an equation the author wishes the reader to produce. 

Interestingly, the word "derive" does not appear (or at least prominently appear) in the problem prompts for this chapter. Instead, there are many other words—"Find", "Compute", "Check", and "Solve"—used in problem prompts. This medley of words seem to multiply our problems of interpretation. Are all of these words synonymous, and if not what do their individual meanings suggest about the associated task for the student? The words "Solve" and "Compute" are perhaps the closest in connotative meaning to the word derive. When you "solve" a differential equation or an algebraic equation you are in a sense deriving the solution to these equations. And when you "compute" (in an analytic sense) a physical quantity you are deriving the result at the end of the computation. The words "find" and "check" might seem farther in meaning from the word derive, the former connoting a search through possible results and the latter connoting a confirmation of a known results rather than the derivation of a new one. But we should of course check a source text to see if this is the case. In problem 2.43 of Griffiths's text it is stated

Imagine a bead of mass  that slides frictionlessly around a circular wire ring of circumference …Find the stationary states (with appropriate normalization) and the corresponding allowed energies…

Here the word "Find" is indeed used analogously to the word "compute" or "solve", the latter being possibly phrased as "solve the Schrödinger equation and obtain the stationary states and the corresponding allowed energies. In problem 2.47, after presenting a potential and a wave function, the problem requests 

(a) Find the expectation value of the Hamiltonian in this state and comment on the result. 

which presents a use of "Find" roughly identical to the use of "Compute". The word "check", however, appears to be more niche. Problem 2.37 is stated as 

Find  for the th stationary state of the harmonic oscillator. Check that the uncertainty principle is satisfied. 

Here, the word "Check" is asking the student to affirm that a specific example is consistent with a known general result in the subject. In this affirmation the student will likely work through some calculations, but it would seem imprecise to claim that she is "deriving" something. Rather, she is "showing" something to be true. 

Thus, going back to the various words delineating actions as they exist in mathematics and physics, we have "prove" and "show" for mathematics and "show", "derive", "compute", "find", "check", and "solve" in physics. Our above discussion suggests that "show" in physics is akin to "prove" and "show" in mathematics", while "check" in physics seems to be a lower standard of logical justification, but still in the direction of a proof. The words "derive", "compute", "find", and "solve" however seem to connote something different from the word "proof", and the difference seems to be centered around one's prior knowledge of the end result. 

Both proofs and derivations can be framed as "If P, then Q" statements, however before constructing a proof, one has the full "If-then" statement, but before completing a derivation (or "finding a result", "computing a physical quantity", or "solving an equation") one only has a knowledge of the "If" and one pursues the "then" given its definition within the problem. 

In other words, in a proof one knows the form of the end result, but in a derivation one generally does not. This is why "show" is only used sometimes in the framing for physics derivations and many times in the framing for mathematical proofs. When proving something you must first know the result that your proof seeks to achieve in the end. This knowledge is contained within theorems, propositions, and lemmas which are only proved when one is able to logically connect the premise to the conclusion. This property also exists when one is "showing" something to be true as in the referenced Griffiths problem.

However, when you derive a result (or compute something or solve an equation), you are venturing into somewhat unexplored territory. Rather than showing something is true, you are calculating something given prior definitions in the subject. For example, students can be asked the following questions in a classical mechanics class
Derive the equation of motion for the system of springs shown in the figure. 

Compute the time it takes the ball to complete its trajectory from launch to ground-collision. 

Solve the simple harmonic oscillator equation of motion in the cased of damped oscillation. 

In all three of these cases, the student would be working through a logical deduction at the end of which would be a conclusion which follows naturally from the starting point (together with auxiliary definitions and assumptions), but since this conclusion was not known at the beginning, the problem could not have been phrased as a theorem and so the students could not be said to have proved anything. The nature of these problems is that they rely on the student understanding the meaning of quantities which exist outside the problem itself. In order to derive an 

So we have come to one major difference between derivations and proofs. Proofs occur in both pure mathematics and physics, but pure mathematics—with its focus on theorems and hence on "If P, then Q" statements in which the "Q" is known prior to the construction of a proof—does not really have derivations.  So, it appears the skills necessary to do physics are at first glance wider than the skills necessary to do pure mathematics. 

A pure mathematician might disagree with this claim. Both physics derivations and mathematical proofs rely on deductive logic, but mathematical proofs have a greater fidelity to reasoning without approximation and intuition. In constructing a mathematical proof, one cannot use any result which has not been proved prior. Thus, things which appear reasonable and sensible, but which have not been logically justified, are absent from deductions. This is not the case in physics where an intuitive understanding of various solutions or asymptotic behavior allows you to neglect unwieldy aspects of an equation or walk down a gentler path in a derivation. A physicist might not see this flexibility as a detriment; from her perspective the mathematician is just not using all the tools in the toolbox. 

But again, the fidelity to logical rigor is one reason why some view pure mathematics as existing on a higher intellectual plane than physics. Another reason is the formal symbolic language that mathematics often employs. Symbols like  (meaning "for all", "there exists", "is an element of", "union", "intersection", "subset", and "set of all real numbers) are replete in mathematical proofs and work to set them apart (at the level of optics) from derivations in physics. But this too is debatable. Why is  in mathematics substantively different from  in physics? Well, possibly because  has a constant meaning throughout all of mathematics and  varies in specific meaning across physics disciplines (Potential Energy? Electrostatic Potential? Scalar Field?). 

Still, the symbolic language is a weak path to walk down since the structure of mathematics would not change decidedly without it (although some theorem's like Gödel's incompleteness theorems might require even more creativity to construct). 

Back to the point about tools in the toolbox. The physicists free-wheeling mathematical manipulations might seem sloppy to the mathematician, and the mathematician's careful logical steps might seem pedantic to the physicist, but this is all fine since the objectives of the two are quite different. The mathematician seeks to construct solid mathematical theories from axioms and benefiting from the collective experience of her forbears she knows that intuitively reasonable results cannot be considered as the "truths" of a theory unless they are proven. The physicist on the other hand seeks to understand physical reality, and again benefiting from the collective experience of her forbears, she is willing to use whatever tools at her disposal to do this. Mathematics, she has learned, is one such useful tool and one of the specifically important lessons associated with using it is that one does not get into trouble (i.e., the objective of physical understanding is not made unachievable) by using unrigorous heuristics and approximations. Indeed the opposite seems to be the case. Thus derivations in physics and proofs in mathematics have differences stemming from the different purposes of the two subjects. It is inaccurate to claim that one is intellectually "better" than the other unless one makes an unfounded (might we say "unrigorous") claim that the values which propel one are better than those that propel the other. 

I should return to my question: Is there a difference between proofs in mathematics and derivations in physics? Well yes and no. Physics derivations are logically more flexible than mathematical proofs, but both use logical deduction to obtain their conclusions. Also, as I mentioned, derivations are mostly concerned with using the general definitions in a subject to obtain special cases of important physical properties (e.g., "Derive the energy of a simple harmonic oscillator"), and thus at the start of a derivation the "then Q" part of the "If P, then Q" statement is not generally known. However, in proofs the entire "If P, then Q" statement is known and the investigator seeks a logical connection between the two. 

So, if I am going to learn how to complete mathematical proofs, it appears that the main thing I would need to learn is how to be scrupulously faithful to logical deduction. Intuition can be used to outline the steps of the proof but the steps must be implemented logically. I must then also be able to recognize logical gaps in my own arguments and be able to fill them in deductively.

Outline?Misc Items 
Proofs refer to something different with regard to knowledge and truth than derivations. Proof suggests truth (truth as obtained from axioms, definitions, and other theorems); Derivation suggests a result embedded in a larger theory (although this is the very definition of theorem)
Claim: Learning mathematical proofs gives you immediate knowledge of physics derivations; not quite => physics derivations use heuristics, approximations, and intuition a formally trained mathematician wouldn't know

Atkins and The Four Laws That Govern Our Universe
I recently finished reading Atkins book which I borrowed as background material for the MITES course I taught this past summer. I read the chapters on conservation of energy and the definition of entropy, chapters which I skipped earlier because I felt I understood them better than I understood the concepts underlying the first and third laws of thermodynamics. Lo and behold these seemingly familiar concepts still held great insight and clarified things that I had seemingly already learned. Here is a bullet point list of some of the things I learned from these two chapters. 

Defining Heat

When I was teaching statistical physics this past summer I struggled to come up with a clean and simple definition of heat. The best I could come up with was that heat energy added to the system that came from any other source besides work. Atkins has a simpler definition which I will now use: Heat is exchanges in energy due to differences in temperature, and in particular heat flows from a higher temperature to a lower temperature although this latter point is separate from the definition of heat and rather is a restatement of the second law

One has to be careful with how this definition is applied. For the isothermal expansion of a gas in the Carnot cycle, the temperature of the system is maintained at the same temperature as that of the reservoir, and yet heat is being added to the system. The caveat is that the system is increasing in volume so the heat added to the system is converted into the work the system does on the surroundings. So in defining heat as "energy changes due to temperature differences" we need to include the caveat that this definition only applies provided all extensive parameters (like total magnetization or volume) are constant. 

An analogy for Clausius's definition of change in entropy 

Atkins has a useful analogy for understanding the definition of change in entropy as . His analogy is meant to explain intuitively why adding heat to a low temperature system results in a much larger change in entropy than adding heat to a high temperature system. 

Consider a person sneezing in either a library or on a busy street. In this example, sound noise is the analog of heat energy (i.e., the energy of random thermal motion), and given that temperature can be seen as a proxy for amount of heat energy in a system, high temperature systems are much more noisy than low temperature systems. The "disruption" or "commotion" caused by the addition of noise is what we take to be the entropy; this is admittedly a qualitative definition of entropy. When someone sneezes in a library (the analog of a low temperature system), the resulting disruption is very great. However when someone sneezes on a busy street (the analog of a high temperature system), the added noise might be the same but the resulting disruption is much lower than in the previous case because of how noisy a busy street already is. This analogy is not as contrived as it may seem for sound noise and thermal noise can both be seen as just two different kinds of noise. 

Heat, Temperature, and Entropy Changes

I have a better understanding of the inequality . (In contrast to my course notes, I will use δ to denote very small changes in physical quantities and Δ to denote large changes.) First, the equality only applies for reversible processes. I think of a reversible process as one which occurs under equilibrium conditions. For example, the slow expansion or compression of a gas against a piston would be an example of a reversible process. To cheat a bit, you can also think of a reversible process as a process which would not look strange were were to reverse our clocks and watch the process in reverse. Thus, the slow expansion of a gas would, upon clock reversal, just look like the slow compression of a gas. However, the expansion of a gas from being in one corner of an isolated room to filling the entire room would, upon clock reversal, look quite strange due to its patent violation of the 2nd law of thermodynamics. (*A question I should ask and answer is how does this clock reversal argument fit with the inequality.)

For irreversible processes the inequality holds. Thus, for a room which is isolated from its surroundings, a gas that expands to fill up the room clearly increases in entropy during its expansion (), however no heat is added to the system (). Given that we established this as an irreversible process we have  . Thus the most general and explicit way to write the relationship between entropy change and heat change is with the reversible and irreversible parts explicit:

. 

Jacob discussed this in his class during the semester, but I didn't understand it completely until recently. 

Clausius's Inequality

For a cyclic process, this inequality gives us Clausius's inequality. In a cyclic process the system begins at an initial state at a certain point in time and returns to the state at another point in time. Since entropy is a physical quantity which depends only on the current state of the system, if the state at the beginning is identical to the state at the end, then the entropy over the cyclic process is zero. Namely . Given the inequality , we then find, for a cyclic process, 



which is Clausius's inequality. The inequality states that for a cyclic process, more reversible-entropy always leaves the system than enters the system. 

Engines, Refrigerators, and Heat Pumps

Clausius's inequality is relevant for simple derivations of the inequalities defining the efficiencies of Carnot engines, refrigerators and heat pumps. Just as a review of what these theoretical machines do 
Engine: Extracts heat from a hot source to do work. Efficiency is defined as output work divided by heat. 
Refrigerator: Uses work to extract heat from a cold sink. Efficiency is defined as heat taken from cold source divided by work. 
Heat Pump: Uses work to pump heat into a hot source. Efficiency is defined as heat pumped into cold source divided by work. 

For the engine, the total entropy change of the system is given by , where  is the heat taken from the heat source and added to the system and  is the heat taken from the system and added to the cold sink. The parameters  and  are the respective temperatures of the hot source and cold sink. The engine has gone through a cyclic process by the end of these heat transfers, so by Clausius's inequality, we have , which implies that . 

Now, given that internal energy is a state function (i.e., a quantity which only depends on the state of the system), the internal energy of the system does not change from beginning to end of the cyclic process. Therefore, the work done by the system can be completely accounted for by considering heat changes. Namely, the work done by the system is . Given the previous inequality for , and the definition of engine efficiency as , we thus find that the inequality for engine efficiency is

. 

For the refrigerator, the total entropy change of the system is given by . By a similar argument as that for the heat engine, we can establish that the heat dumped into the heat source satisfies the inequality . 

By conservation of energy, and the fact that this is a cyclic process, the heat we move from the cold source to the system plus the work we do on the system must equal the heat expelled into the hot sink. Therefore,  or . From here, given the previous inequality for , and the definition of refrigerator efficiency as , we thus find that the inequality for refrigerator efficiency is 

. 

For the heat pump, our calculations are identical to those for the refrigerator, except efficiency is defined as . Therefore, we write the work done on the system as  and the relevant inequality is . With this inequality, our expression for work, and the definition of the Carnot heat pump efficiency, we find the inequality 

.

Theres are all rather simple derivations of efficiencies for systems that I more or less ignored as a student. (*Note what I call the refrigerator and heat pump "efficiencies" are actually called the "coefficients of performance")

Quotes from Nothing Personal by James Baldwin

"To be locked in the past means, in effect, that one has no past, since one can never asses it, or use it: and if one cannot use the past, one cannot function in the present, and so one can never be free."
—

This quote reminded me of the moment in the Ezra Klein-Sam Harris podcast/debate this year when Harris, exasperated by Klein's tangents into the United States history, exclaimed "The weight of American History is completely irrelevant." Klein was arguing that it was both ethically irresponsible and intellectually unrigorous to have an argument about Race and IQ in America without contextualizing your discussion within America's larger history of such discussions. Harris disagreed believed that results of social science studied could be used to arrive at clear conclusions about society without any historical understanding/analysis of how that society came to be. Harris's obstinacy on this point really drove home to me the importance of historical analysis. 

"It has always been much easier (because it has always seemed much safer) to give a name to the evil without than to locate the terror within."  
—

"It is a crisis of identity. And in such a crisis, at such a pressure, it becomes absolutely indispensable to discover, or invent—the two words, here, are synonymous—the stranger, the barbarian, who is responsible for our confusion and our pain. Once he is driven out—destroyed—then we can be at peace: those questions will be gone. Of course, those questions never go, but it has always seemed much easier to murder than to change."
—

Baldwin says "it has always seemed much easier to murder than to change," and in these words I see a mirror of my own reactions to pain and loneliness and incompleteness. Murder is too strong of a word but it is unquestionably in the correct direction. Faced with a slow and relentless erosion of the self you always believe existed, it is almost inevitable that one clings to ideas of safety predicated on transferring your own sense of erosion onto some one else. Your loneliness and disaffection would be improved, perhaps even disappear, if only this person was gone or this group of people were banished. In them you see, your antithesis and you believe that where they exist, you cannot. The belief saves you from the hard and uncertain work of introspection and substitutes one delusion for another. Such an escape is harmful enough if it occurs in the life of a single individual, but what are the consequences when it spreads throughout an entire country? 

"But, if a society permits one portion of its citizenry to be menaced or destroyed, then, very soon, no one in that society is safe."
—

"Children can survive without money or security or safety or things: but they are lost if they cannot find a loving example, for only this example can give them a touchstone for their lives. Thus far and no further: this is what the father must say to the child. If the child is not told where the limits are, he will spend the rest of his life trying to discover them. For the child who is not told where the limits are knows, though he may not know he knows it, that no one cares enough about him to prepare him for his journey."

How much of bringing up a child is a direct act of love for one's progeny and how much is it a more global act of love for one's world? Because whatever lessons you teach this child will inevitably be felt upon the world in how this child lives his or her life. Apathy for one's children suggests not merely self-loathing, but also world-loathing, an indifference to how the new life you are bringing into the world will improve or further desecrate the world. 

Given my own experiences, I know I was lucky. I won the parental lottery. The subtle tragedy in all this is that my sister did not. We had the same parents, but not the same experience being reared under them. My mother was normal most of the time, but fearful of imagined demons which she was sure were using the guise of children's books to pull her daughter into league with Satan, my mother reacted the way many mothers do when they perceive an existential threat to their children: violently. My sister never forgave my mother for this eight year period of her life, and now my mother constantly calls me asking why her daughter does not return her calls. I told my mom why, a reason she surely must have known on some level, and the answer she gave me was unsatisfying: She had tried her best in raising both of us. Given that her daughter no longer wanted to speak with her, I wonder if she think she did a good job. I wonder if given the opportunity to do it all again, with the knowledge of the outcome, she would react to Joke the way she did. 

"Tried her best." I wonder if this is true of all parents, even the ones who apparently don't try at all. People are hemmed in by limitations often only faintly perceived. Our sense of agency can delude us into believing our mistakes could have been prevented, that they were somehow not "of us" but of some unfortunate combination between us and the world. I can't help but question this now. What purpose does this increased sense of agency serve us when it is so inconsistent with the larger arcs of our lives? What salve does it provide for a life of Icarian descents back to the Earth we wrongly felt was too pedestrian to be called home?

"One discovers the light in darkness, that is what darkness is for; but everything in our lives depends on how we bear the light."

I suppose that "darkness" amounts to being lost in some way and the "light" is the truth, metaphysical or concrete, which helps us find some semblance of direction. What does it mean to be lost? I suppose I should know given how constantly I have claimed to be in that state. I can describe what it feels like: purposeless; exhausting; boring. It is a life lived in grey, a life lived on earth but seeming experienced at the edge of the universe where there is no life, no vibrancy, just the entropic hiss of the vacuum of space. What is lost is not really the path, but the guiding force which can see the path or even create one where none exists. Thus what frees one from being "lost" is finding a version of the "self" which imbues life with the luster it was previously lacking. 

Maybe this is the light. What does it mean to bear it? 

"What a journey life is! dependent, entirely, on things unseen."

"If your lover lives in Hong Kong and cannot get to Chicago, it will be necessary for you to go to Hong Kong. Perhaps you will spend your life there, and never see Chicago again. And you will, I assure you, as long as space and time divide you from anyone you love, discovery a great deal about shipping routes, airlines, earthquake, famine, disease, and war. And you will always know what time it is in Hong Kong, for you love someone who lives there. And love will simply have no choice but to go into battle with space and time, and furthermore, to win."

"I have slept on rooftops and in basements and subways, have been cold and hungry all my life; have felt that no fire would ever warm me, and no arms would ever hold me. I have been, as the song says, 'buked and scorned and I know that I always will be. But, my God, in that darkness, which was the lot of my ancestors and my own state, what a mighty fire burned! In that darkness of rage and degradation, that fine flying froth and mist of blood, through all that terror in all that helplessness, a living soul moved and refused to die. We really emptied oceans with a home-made spoon and tore down mountains with out hands. And if love was in Hong Kong, we learned how to swim."
—

"It is a might heritage, it is the human heritage, and it is all there is to trust. And I learned this through descending, as it were, into the eyes of my father and my mother. I wondered, when I was little, how they bore it—for I knew that they had much to bear. It had not yet occurred to me that I also would have much to bear; but they knew it, and the unimaginable rigors of their journey helped them to prepare me for mine."

"The sea rises, the light fails, lovers cling to each other, and children cling to us. The moment we cease to hold each other, the moment we break faith with one another, the sea engulfs us and the light goes out."

Quotes from The Man Who Cried I Am

A writer had to stand the silences that came with being alone, and he hated being lonely and yet it comforted him. You could think when you were alone, and writers needed to think. 
pg 46

In our society which is white — we are intruders they say — there has got to be something inherently horrible about having the sickness and weakness of that society described by a person who is a victim of them; for if he, the victim, is capable of describing what they have believed nonexistent, then they, the members of the mahority, must choose between living the truth, which can be pretty grim, and the lie, which isn't much better. But at least they will then have the choice.

None of the 'great documents' of the West ever acknowledged a racial problem tied to an economic problem, tied to a social problem, tied to a religious problem, tied to a whole nation's survival. And that's why, man, non of them unamended, are worth the paper they were written on.
pg 50

But he was black. Of course he was black, but Negro men, they had a way of starting out with a bang, with the long, long dream, but ending with less than a whisper, so beaten were they simply because they had dared to dream in the first place.

Quotes from Lost in Math by Sabine Hossenfelder

The invention of new natural laws—theory development—is not taught in classes and not explained in textbooks. Some of it physicists learn studying the history of science, but most of it they pick up from older colleagues, friends and mentors, supervisors and reviewers. Handed from one generation to the next, much of it is experience, a hard-earned intuition for what works. When asked to judge the promise of a newly invented but untested theory, physicists draw upon the concepts of naturalness, simplicity or elegance, and beauty. These hidden rules are ubiquitous in the foundations of physics. They are invaluable. And in utter conflict with the scientific mandate of objectivity. 
- pg 2

'In hindsight, it is surprising how much emphasis was put on this naturalness argument,' says Michael. 'If I look back, people repeated the same argument, again and again, not really reflecting on it. they were saying the same things, saying the same thing for ten years. It is really surprising that this was the main driver for so much of model building. Looking back, I find this strange. I still think naturalness is appealing, but I'm not convinced anymore that this points to new physics at the LHC.' (quote from Michael Krämer)
- pg 14


Maxwell himself, for example, didn't like electrodynamics the way he conceived it because he couldn't come up with an underlying mechanical model. Back then, the standard of beauty was a mechanical clockwork universe, but in Maxwell's theory electromagnetic fields just are—they are not made of anything else, no gears or notches, no fluids or valves. Maxwell was unhappy about his own theory because he though that only 'when a physical phenomenon can be completely described as a change in the configuration and motion of a material system, the dynamical explanation of the phenomenon is said to be complete.' Maxwell tried for many years to explain electric and magnetic fields by something that would fit the mechanistic worldview. Alas, in vain. 
- pg 32 

What I learn, however, is that Karl Popper's idea that scientific theories must be falsifiable has long been an outdated philosophy. I am glad to hear this, as it's a philosophy that nobody in science ever could have used, other than as a rhetorical device. It is rarely possible to actually falsify an idea, since ideas can always be modified or extended to match incoming evidence. Rather than falsifying theories, therefore, we 'implausify' them: a continuously adapted theory becomes increasingly difficult and arcane—not to say ugly—and eventually practitioners lose interest. How much it takes to implausify an idea, however, depends on one's tolerance for repeatedly making a theory fit conflicting evidence.
 - pg 40

We use these and other abstractions because they work, because we have found they describe nature. From a purely mathematical standpoint they are certainly not inevitable; if they were we could derive them by logic alone. But we can never prove any math to be a true description of nature, for the only provable truths are about mathematical structures themselves, not about the relation of these structures to reality. Hence rigidity is a meaningful criterion only once we fix a backbone of assumptions from which to make deductions. 
pg 74

'To come back to the question why do people still work on it,' Nima says, breaking the silence, 'to begin with, the interest in susy has plummeted. I mean, there are still people working on it. There are lots of diseases in academia and one of them is that you keep doing what you've been doing. Somehow it turns out that everybody does the analytic continuation of what they've been doing for their PhD. But the good this is that the experimentalists don't care.
pg 85 

In the arts, in writing, and in science too we like to be surprised, but not too much. Though it's harder to quantify than sound patterns, scientific papers also need to strike a balance between old and new. Novelty is good, but not if it expects too much of the audience. The real pop stars, like the scientific pop stars, are those living just on the edge; they are the ones who make us slap our heads and mutter, "Why didn't I think of that?"
	But ideas in science, unlike in the arts, aren't an end unto themselves; they are means to the end of describing the natural world. In science, new data can enforce change. But what if there are no new data? Then we reinvent hits from the past, in more or less obvious ways. And the new theories in physics, like new pop songs, remain variations on already familiar themes.

[Lost in Math PostScript] October 12, 2018 - 1:54 PM

I don't imagine this was her intention, but, in Lost in Math, Hoseenfelder presents a depressing picture of the current state of theoretical particle physics. I felt the force of this most intensely in Chapter 8 "Space, the Final Frontier." In the chapter she discusses string theory with Joe Polchinski who goes through all of his mathematical reasons for why physicists should believe in the theory. 1) String theory succeeds in quantizing gravity; 2) The theory naturally (and rigidly) follows from the assumption that there are strings; 3) The theory is geometric; 4) String theory's gauge-gravity duality revealed new insights about physics; 5) String theory has contributed to black hole thermodynamics; 6) String theory predicted the multiverse. I do not find these justifications in of them selves inadequate. Physicists have always had to use non-deductive arguments for why theories should be accepted. What is troubling is that this chapter reveals that there are so many other competing mathematically formulated theories with their own non-deductive arguments for acceptance that, in the absence of any experimental comparisons, it is really not clear which theory is the best. Moreover, string theory has so thoroughly bastardized the standards for theory acceptance that physicists nowadays seem to have no shame in presenting an aesthetically motivated theory couched in elaborate mathematics which they believe the physics community should nevertheless take seriously even though it makes no precise predictions about the world. 

Amongst the theories discussed in this chapter: Garret Lisi's E8 theory; Asymptotically Safe Gravity, Causal dynamical triangulation; Xia-Gang Wen's qubit theory. In the previous chapter, there is Alain Connes's theory grounded in a 384 by 384 dimensional matrix representation.  

It seems everyone has their pet theory. Everyone has their unique perspective on what a fundamental theory of physics should consist of. What string theory has going for it is roughly 40 years of uncontested dominance in the high energy physics community, leading to name recognition, prestige, and a large collection of mathematical results to which proponents can point towards as reasons for why the theory should be accepted. But these factors are not independent. String theory's large collection of results came from people flocking to the field because of its name recognition, and the large number of people working in the field led to its popularity and prestige.  

At one point Lisi, proponent and developer of E8 theory, says—quite accurately in my opinion—'I know I sound like a string theorist! I share much of their motivations and desires. If I had gathered momentum with thousands of people for thirty year, working on E8 theory, and it failed, I would be in exactly the same position as they are now.' (pg. 165)

This situation reminds me somewhat of an evolutionary dynamics simulation. Once can imagine having a collection of organisms of various fitness which compete for resources in a population. One might believe that the organism with the highest fitness would eventually take over the population, but in fact due to the randomness of reproduction, it is possible that an organism less fit than the optimal can fix if it just so happens to reproduce slightly earlier than the more fit organism. Maybe in a similar way, string theory, first on the scene, has evolved towards fixation in the high energy physics community even though it is not in fact the best approach to quantizing gravity. 

In philosophy of science this week, I posed the question "What should a scientist do when his or her colleagues espouse work practices that he or she thinks are antithetical, if not to their research discipline, to science itself?" What motivated the question was not only the recent the replicability crisis in sociology and biology, but also the current state of theoretical physics. In much the same way that a young sociologist can be inculcated in the unsound methods of data collection and selection which afford them rapid career advancement within their discipline but which are ultimately harmful to the larger project of building and checking knowledge about the social world, a young theorist can be inculcated in the standards for theory development and interrogation which may lead to the respect of his or her like-minded colleagues but does not contribute to the historically-understood conception of what is means to build knowledge of the physical world. 

One could of course allow for the possibility that the standards for theory selection grow and change as a science develops and that we are simply in a new phase of such change. Such phases certainly have occurred in the past with the Newtonian revolution in the 17th century and in the quantum revolution of the 20th century being prominent examples. However, one could argue that if a similar change were to be happening again today and this change had been precipitated by people accepting and running with the current standards of theory selection in high energy physics, then the change would be more drastic than the previous ones. Each of the previous changes were changes in what physicists believed constituted an understanding of the physical world, in particular what they felt mandated an explanation in their physical theories. In the Newtonian revolution, scientists gained great predictive power but had no explanation for why the force between gravitational bodies varied as the inverse square of the distance. In the quantum revolution, scientists again found theories that were able to predict experiments, but found that interpreting these theories led to conflicts with classically-built intuition. In each case some idea about what it meant to have a theory of physics was relinquished, but these ideas were relinquished in response to experimental evidence which suggested the theory was correct even if physicists had not yet resolved its interpretative challenges. There is no such evidence for modern theories of particle physics. Indeed what modern theorists are implicitly arguing is the opposite, that we relinquish the very thing (i.e., experimental evidence) which, historically, had led us to relinquish all our previous naive conceptions of reality.  

Recently I've felt that the main difference between crackpot science and modern theoretical physics is that the latter is couched in a deductive framework which lends some semblance of consistency to its equally specious claims about the world. There is also something about the confluence of authority, education, and artificial scarcity masquerading as prestige which exacerbates the problems Hossenfelder mentions and leads to their propagation in the new generation. In one chapter Hossenfelder talks to Katherine Mack ("Astrokatie" on Twitter), a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Melbourne. Hossenfelder asks her about fine tuning and the Higgs mass, and for some reason I thought that since Mack was so young she would not be so committed to the standard claims for why physicists believe fine-tuning is problematic. But I was wrong: " 'What's wrong with fine-tuning?' I ask Katie. 'In general, fine-tuning tells us there is something unnatural about our theories. If there is a number that is really small, you have to assume that you got really, really lucky. And that's never appealing. It just seems that there should be some other explanation for it.' "

In The Evil of Banality, Minnich states "There is no one sort of banality; almost anything can become banal if we use it so often that it prefigures the world for us without our even noticing anymore. Not only clichés and conventions: insider jargon, technical terms, field-specific logics, and scientific, political, military, econcomic, psychological, religious, and other domain-defining categories can function as entrance requirements to our attention." How many times does one need to hear the terms "naturalness" and "fine-tuning" and "hierarchy problem" before these terms no longer function as a means to elucidate and specify a problem, but instead become mere stepping stones for the support and justification of some other line of argument. "We need supersymmetry because of naturalness. Supersymmetry says…" and off we go.

What could cause something like this? Isn't the new generation supposed to be trail-blazing, and iconoclastic? Leaving behind the tired methods of their forebears and seeking out something new? Perhaps, but such transformations rely on the existence of a community wide reward- and power-structure which makes them likely, if not merely possible. Such structures do not exists in high energy theory today given the way graduate education is structured as an apprenticeship and the fact that research prior to tenure is perceived as a trial period during which scientists prove their worth by solving problems their colleagues can easily appreciate.  

Part of why I stopped working in high energy physics was because I felt it was intellectually dishonest to publish papers in a field whose foundational premises about reality I did not believe in*. The other part was that, for the topics I was encouraged to work on, it felt as though I was being asked to further clear a path which was first paved by someone else following their own aesthetic—and to me, quite arbitrary—motivations. In essence some luminary came up with this great new idea for reasons I could neither fully see nor appreciate and I, as a student, was tasked with further elaborating on this great new idea in spite of my deep-seated ignorance and skepticism of the idea's underlying motivations. 

*In a class I taught, I once joked with the students that in undergrad, I studied the properties of a hypothetical symmetry breaking particle of a hypothetical super-partner of a hypothetical particle. For those in the know, I studied the properties of pseudo-goldstinos which are associated with the breaking of local supersymmetry which implies the existence of a gravitino which is the super-partner of the graviton, the latter of which has not been experimentally observed.

Is my current work really any better? I did not personally develop the partition function in statistical physics and yet much of my work follows from it, with little to no cognitive dissonance. What is different? I think it is a matter of values. Both the partition functions of statistical physics and the many equations of string theory are mathematical frameworks for describing physical phenomena. But string theory requires too many presumptuous leaps for me to believe in it, and it is now filled to the brim with people doing work which seeks to answer questions I do not care about. Statistical physics on the other hand has few presumptuous leaps and it has been experimentally validated many times over. Moreover, I have managed to carve out from it a set of problems that I find really interesting and which no one else seems interested in. Consequently I feel no pressure to solve these problems quickly. I am in a way sacrificing prestige for peace of mind, but I have found, against expectation, that I do not see this as a sacrifice at all. It was admittedly difficult to come to this perspective, so tightly does one's narcissism hold on to the idea that value can only be bestowed by some external lens, but I am building it stronger and stronger every day.

Lessons from "Self-Assembly of a Dimer System" - 6:35 PM

All of these lessons are variations on a single theme. The theme is "Keep working/Asking questions/Pushing until you find something non-trivial and interesting."

Build up from simple soluble models: The final dimer-system models are arguably complicated, but the first models I considered were much simpler. In their simplest manifestation I considered a model of association and dissociation in which there were  identical monomers each of which could dimerize with any other monomer with binding energy . In this first iteration, I didn't even include the free particle partition functions for the monomers or dimers, so that there was no real entropy cost to creating a dimer. The resulting partition function was

 .


From here, I found a way to incorporate the ideal gas partition function, distinguishable particles, and correct/incorrect interactions. 

The advantage in beginning with simple models is that you can establish base cases from which you can build more elaborate extensions. Moreover, the intuition from these base cases can be used whenever you're trying to check the validity of the subsequent extensions. 

I should note that this is not a new lesson. I'm quite sure I've included some variant of this lesson in all of my previous "Lessons" documents. 

Takeaway: Begin with very simple models of the question you're investigating, and then work to extend and modify these initial steps in useful directions. 

—-

Push model as far as possible and be explicit about limitations: This self-assembly work all started from an attempt to derive a physical prediction from the favorable-contact model. Finding that the model context did not match the system to which I was applying it, I realized that I would have to include dissociation before I could make any good faith physical predictions. This realization, and deciding to pursue it rather than to sweep it under the rug, is what led to what is now a much more interesting and physically relevant project. 

I have taken this lesson to heart in this current work and have tried to make explicit comparisons to biomolecular systems. These attempts have revealed limitations in the model which I am not entirely sure how to overcome, but being explicit about these limitations at least allows me to phrase them as problems with ostensible solutions. 

Takeaway: Always push the model (either predictively or theoretically) as far as you can. It is only through such forcing/pushing that you can be clear what the limitations of the model are and how you would need to modify the model in order to overcome these limitations. 

—-

Start over from a different foundation if you have to: In moving away from the favorable contact model, I had to, for a time, begin a new line of questioning concerned with association/dissociation rather than with favorable/unfavorable contacts. I was initially unsure as to whether this detour was a waste of time, but in retrospect it clearly was not. With this experience I therefore have a solid example of why it is sometimes useful to start a problem anew, from a different perspective or at least to focus on a sub-problem as you seek to solve your main problem. 

Takeaway: Be mindful of inconsistencies in your work and be willing to put the main question aside for some time as you try to resolve them. 

—-

Keep exploring until you find something surprising: If your final understanding of a problem has not exceeded  your initial understanding, then the work is likely not finished. Namely, if you walk away with more or less the same understanding of the problem, with just a lot more mathematical terrain covered in between, then all your mathematical work has largely been for naught. The purpose of couching physical formalisms in mathematics is that they elucidate things that intuition alone cannot, so if all the mathematics is doing is reifying and making precise your intuition then you're likely not asking the best questions you could be asking. 

You should always work to finding something better than what you were initially looking for. 

Takeaway: Variation on "Push model as far as possible" The reason you want to continually push the model is because you want to find something interesting. 

—-

Be wary of trivial solutions: Something I have learned recently (or, actually, am still learning), is that if a calculation is too easy, then you have likely not exhausted the capabilities of the formalism which led to the calculation. I am recognizing this for the "Partitions, partition functions, and aggregation" and "statistical physics of ligand-binding interactions" projects.  A lot of the first-pass solutions I am finding reproduce results that were found ~40-50 years ago. 

However, being wary of trivial solutions is not only necessary to ensure that your work is new. It is also to make sure you are getting the most out of the formalism you just introduced formalism. When developing the model of correct-incorrect dimers, had I stopped when I found the partition function for the dimerization of identical monomers, I would have had an interesting model, but one which was not nearly as interesting as what I eventually came up with. The same is true for the statistical physics of the symmetric group work (had I stopped at the series expression for the partition function). Perhaps, this particular aspect of research (that is, the way trivial solutions can pave the way for more interesting ones) is another solid argument against, publishing results quickly. 

Takeaway: After you establish a rigorously-derived result, if the result was derived rather simply, use it as a foundation for more elaborate/interesting investigations. 


—-

Sometimes the work is just not ready: If you spend a lot of time on a project and manage to obtain a conclusion which seems vaguely interesting, you might be lulled into a false complacency which leads you to stop the work well before it is finished. Instead of being so lulled it is often better to see this first "vaguely interesting" conclusion as a port from which you can make further ever more interesting excursions. 

There is a quote which nicely encapsulates this idea: The pretty initial position which falls short of completeness is not to be valued — except as a stimulus for further moves (Richard Diebenkorn). 

It must have been difficult for me to accept that the "Favorable Contact" work was not yet in its final stages given that I had conceived of the idea early 2017/late 2016 and was preparing to publish it in the fall of 2017. But it really was not ready for publication, because there were still some questions that it left unanswered. It was only be deciding to pursue these latter questions, and in affect to move beyond my "pretty initial position, that I was able to find a more interesting problem framework. 

I think the fact of this lesson could be used as a way to encourage you to start projects you're unsure about. It is possible that the project will fail in that what you say peripherally in the night will prove to be no more real than an apparition. But even if you do manage to make something solid, recognize that the weight of you dreams need not rest on it, for it will only exist as the first step to something that you cannot see and which lays beyond, something which exists as a traversable path down the other side of a mountain that you have yet to climb. 

Takeaway: Even if you have done (what you consider) a large amount of work towards a project, it may not be ready for publication and in fact may serve a better function as merely the first step for an even more interesting excursion.

Quotes from The Evil of Banality

You could not get a genocide or any of those massive harms done if you had to provide guards with guns to force the perpetrators to do their work every day, every time. I am afraid it turns out that people will do that work for far more mundane reasons. — pg. 53


What surprised Jewish Germans during this period [1933, when Hitler became Chancellor] was not the cruelty of kleptocrats, fanatics, and malcontents, but the behavior of friends, neighbors, and colleagues who were not gripped by devotion to Nazism. Most Germans fell into this category. Jews sadly noted their mundane lapses: the silence of a store clerk who refused to answer an inquiry, the politely worded requests to drop their memberships in leisure and civic associations, or the embarrassed silence that greeted them as they walked into a favorite café. — Claudia Koonz, The Nazi Conscience, pg. 11, 


To be attentive is to be able to be startled back into thought to become again able to be in touch with the originality of all that is around us, and so also to be aware of what we are actually doing, here and now. — pg. 75


…any knowledge that doesn't lead to new questions quickly dies out: It failed to maintain the temperature required for sustaining life. In the most extreme cases, cases well known from ancient and modern history, it even poses a lethal threat to society— pg 76 of Minich, by Wisława Szymborska Nobel Prize Speech


What is of concern is the very real possibility — I am afraid I believe it — that most societies, economies, and their educational systems prepare reliable workers who do not think [about] what they are doing. — pg. 167


Giving us a job that rewards hard work with pay, perks, status, that makes us feel like "winners," goes a long way toward turning our minds off with regard to anything but playin that game well. In good times, that only makes us less alive, less interesting, less humane, and more dependent on the employers and systems that keep the bounty coming than we ought to be. When systems go bad, it can turn us into the hard workers that a different game, an extensive evil, requires. - pg. 169 


I now believe careerism to be prime among the preparations for extensive evil: it practices and rewards us for playing a game well and in its own terms, absorbing us to such an extent that attentiveness and free thinking yield entirely to a calculating, analytical intelligence that moves only within the bounds of the game. - pg. 170

It helps if recastings of realties (neighbors becoming losers, leeches, cast as threats; looting and rape regularized as reward, not crime; sweatshops as economic opportunity) continue so that people get used to them, so that newer phrases do not catch their attention. If you are perverting a whole set of systems, you do not want anyone's attention caught. You want their minds to move right on with you, on the tracks you are laying down. Be careful here, though. You actually do want their minds to be functioning: "descriptive and meticulous" discussions are fine. They occupy the mind, keeping attention on your platform, on work to be done, struggles to be taken up, goals to reach, rewards to strive for, all of which will take some instrumental figuring out, some shrewdness, some narrow-gauge, means-ends assessments, and a genuine interest in self-advancement—just as careerism in other times and places does. I used the image of tumbleweeds for minds moved by sweeping, broadscale, publicity. The image here is perhaps of game players as they approach being gamblers, from chess fanatics to games on electronic devices, to poker: our minds then can be intensely active, but they are also occupied. We are precisely not thinking around, about, outside of the rules of the game. We are just trying to win by the rules of the occupation. Focus [is] rewarded, not reflection. There is no time for that. - pg. 174 

Considering my own field work, it is interesting for Minnich to liken careerism to a game. People have often considered mathematics to be a game with foundational rules which completely determine all possible outcomes of the rules, so, by Minnich's call, if someone is working in a mathematical science (like high energy physics) and is attempting to advance career-wise in the field, then their advancement is predicated on their success in a metagame, i.e., their being adept players of the game of mathematics within the game of careerism. 

I think one can argue that the assessment of scientists as careerists is unfair. Science pays so little that it seems unlikely that those who dedicate their time and energy to it are chasing after the standard careerist carrots of great financial reward. But Hossenfelder [I think?] once said that scientists are more narcissistic than greedy so what entices them is the prospects of prestige and communal recognition rather than strictly financial gain. So when evaluating the scientists and the choices they may about what to work on, how to publish papers, etc., if you inspect their actions through a strictly financial lens you would see a distorted image suggesting that such scientists are either financially ignorant or simply more noble than the rest of us. But, even if the basic motivators are not the same, the consequences are quite similar. Seeking high citation counts, easily fundable grants, and peer-acceptance leads to very many of the same "short-game" and self-protecting behaviors observed by lawyers, doctors, or any other of the standard salaried professionals.

An abnegation and a recurrent thought
Recently I have been consumed with thoughts about my past failures in love and friendship. To be candid, the thoughts have always been there in the background but something that happened a few weeks ago pulled them and a host of insecurities and fears to the front. I met with Courtney for a writing session at the beginning of October and during dinner afterwards I mentioned that Neal and I would probably go apple picking later in the month. Courtney laughed. She said she couldn't envision me picking apples, but if it was going to happen she would like to come. I think I was OK with this, with her coming with Neal and I to a place far from the city and where the two of us would have ordinarily been part of a shared space that no one else would have invaded. Courtney thought more about it and suggested that it could be a double date with her bringing her boyfriend Scott. I met Scott over the summer and I have to admit that I was not impressed. A tall and lanky guy who told me that he was a "scientist" and when I inquired further told me he worked with "DNA coding" and clarified that he didn't mean programming. The only people who have ever told me that they were "scientists" were people with their heads so far up their asses that they couldn't imagine a stranger ever being able to appreciate a more specific job description like biochemist or microbiologist. And to clarify what he meant about "DNA coding" ever before I asked for a clarification further suggested that he thought his work was so far from the public understanding that its description needed to be sprinkled with caveats lest the ignorant masses be led astray. 

OK. I know. I'm sensitive. But, rationalizations aside, I did not like this guy. 

Still, I was willing to take my first impressions as non-illustrative of his actual character and learn more about him, or—if the first impressions were accurate—endure a weekend with him if Courtney was coming along. But after she suggested that it could be a double date, she thought of more friends she could invite and turned the occasion into a triple date. By now, I was wishing I had never invited her to come along. I do not do well with strangers. I am not so sociopathic that I remain in a mute and brooding silence as they ask me questions about work and place of origin, but engaging with those questions is always more exhausting for me when they are coming from people I do not know. After a party or after a dinner with many new people, I am often so exhausted from such engagements that I would spend the next two days in a haze unable to muster enough energy to get out of bed on time or to work. I would always attend these events because a friend invited me and I didn't want to offend him or her, but over the years it has become easier to say no or to not feel bad about flaking out in the last minute. Why? I think it's because I am starting to care less and less what people think of me, but still this indifference must compete with a nameless and sourceless sense of obligation to keep true to my commitments. 

I have to say that this sense of obligation, ennobling as it was, never sufficed as the foundation for the relationships in which it operated. I would feel obligated to kindness and to respect and to only saying something if I meant it, and with my position established and clear, I would observe friends and relationship prospects doing dances of avoidance and responsibility, clearly feeling very little of the compulsion I felt to be consistent with past and future versions of my self. Women would say they want to hang out, and then always be unavailable when I proposed a date. The brothers of Nu Delta—trust, respect, and brotherhood being their tenets—would make all sorts of promises about some future task only to be conspicuously absent when the final day came. You would tell a friend your feelings and they would say the friendship can still continue only for their texts to become less frequent and your distance between them to grow. I was hurt by my obligations to others and yet I still felt obligated. I could not shake this sense of attachment, but little did I know that with each unreciprocated act of kindness each text left ignored, my sense of what is right and what is true was gradually being chipped away and I was preparing myself for a new way of living in which I would treat people not the way I wanted to be treated but the way the average mass of humanity has treated me. 

The problem is that I can always sense quite intensely another person's desire for something. So internally I feel both my aversion and their desire, and self-abnegating as always I opt for making the other person happy rather than myself. But maybe this is too self-congratulatory. Maybe I do not sense their desire at all, but merely exacerbate their projected sense of disappointment if I were to tell them no. The result is the same: I quietly forfeit the battle dictating how best I should be spending my time. 

But sometimes the battle goes on. At the end of our dinner, I told Courtney I would text her about the pending apple-picking trip. Given how I then felt about the trip, I don't know why I said this. Maybe I couldn't think of any other parting statement that was as emotionally reassuring. Anyway, with the words spoken, I again felt my former obligation to fulfill them. Two weeks later, on a Tuesday, I was at Neal's apartment when he asked what we were doing the coming weekend. Neal and I had always planned to go to an apple orchard in October and that coming weekend would have been an excellent one. But now that I had promised Courtney that that I'd tell her when our trip was happening, I felt I had to check with her for her availability. So I texted her asking if she and Scott were free the coming weekend. She texted back immediately—something she has never ever done in our former correspondence—that she was free on Sunday and that she would check with Scott. A day later she said Scott was also free, and she asked what apple orchards I was looking into. Eventually, we settled on Russel Orchards, and with the plans made Courtney asked if it was OK if her friend Joy, Joy's husband, and their son could come along. I wish I was the kind of person who didn't care about a change like this, but suddenly I felt unambiguously that I no longer wanted to go on this trip. Now, rather than spending time with Neal, I would also have to feign interest in Scott, and two of Courtney's other friends. For Courtney the trip would only consist of her meeting one person she didn't know well (i.e., Neal), but I would now have to deal with four people. Moreover, the guilt I felt about cancelling the trip was suddenly swamped by this new aversion. Within two hours of her asking if her friends could come, I told her Neal and I decided to stay in Boston that weekend. 

Wasn't there another way I could handle this? Why didn't I just say "No. I don't want your friend, her husband, and their son to come. And if you insist on their coming, I no longer want to go on the trip." Of course I wouldn't have say that—maybe something more like "I would prefer if it was just a double date"—but, ultimately, I felt that even a more polite statement, although more honest than my own dance of avoidance and flakiness, would be too revealing. Far better, I thought, for her to think I was the kind of person who would bail when I felt like it than the kind of person who would bail because he didn't like the prospect of meeting too many new people. 

Courtney said she was disappointed that we changed plans. Apparently, she was really looking forward to seeing us and she kept her Sunday free for it. This made me feel bad, so I made another promise that I knew I probably wouldn't keep: I told her that I was sorry and that I would try to set up another occasion for her and Neal to meet each other.

The truth was I felt a mix of guilt and self-righteousness the latter because I had finally done to Courtney what she had so often done to me. In the past we have made plans to go to dinner or watch a play, only for her to cancel on the very day of the event. I never told her these cancellations annoyed me, but I always harbored them as indications that she didn't really care what I thought about her and thus didn't care what I felt about her. And now I was able to give her some of that in return. It felt oddly empowering, causing pain to someone who previously hurt you. 

This incident with Courtney I think is what has caused much of my recent introspection about my past relationships. I think about Elana and Amy and Guan and Keizo and Tony, and what I seek from these thoughts is some framing in which the pain and joy can be neatly organized into slots which function as some part of a larger coherent whole. Something which tells me precisely what went wrong and what went right and what I will need to do in the future to make sure my mistakes are not repeated. 

In short I am seeking closure. But as I live and make these chaotic bumps and reversals from people who go from strangers to lovers and friends to strangers again, I am becoming ever more aware of the fact that what we should be striving for is not closure, so rarely it is achieved, but the ability to accept its absence, the ability to live within the interstice of implicit questions unanswered and long forgotten by the people to whom we originally posed them. Before such acceptance, once can drive oneself insane searching for patterns in a class of events that has for centuries been known to be devoid of them. And I am hoping that after the initial forays into such habits acceptance, one can replace insanity with peace, and from this peace find ways to see future relationships as the opportunities they are rather than as deadly radioactive substances with indeterminate half-lifes.

October 25, 2018 — 10:19 AM
I first saw the film Gattaca in the summer after my junior year of high school, and since then it has been one of my favorites.  Recap for those who haven't seen it: It's set in a society in which embryonic gene editing is the norm, and parents can choose which physical, cognitive, etc., traits they want their children to have, ever before such children are taken to term (ever before such children are the proverbial twinkle in their father's eye). In one of the early scenes of the film, we are shown two parents in a spare sepia toned office discussing with their doctor (played by a dashing Blair Underwood) what should or should not be included in the genetic profile of their second child. Their first child was conceived naturally, and from his natural genetic profile had a high probability of depression, ADHD, and neurological disease and was given  a life-expectancy of 30 years due to a predicted heart disorder. For their second child, it seems the parents didn't want to leave as much to chance. 

Narrating his subsequent life, the first child explains "I belonged to a new underclass, no longer determined by social status or the color of your skin. No. We now have discrimination down to a science." The narrator has aspirations of going into space, but his inferior genetics bar him from any of the positions which could make that dream possible. However, he is intense, tenacious, and committed and finds a way to hide his identity behind another which he uses to gain access to a space corporation planning a flight to Saturn's moon Titan. In the corporation, our hero proves himself to be a master navigator and is eventually chosen to be part of the new mission. His plans are almost derailed by a murder (don't worry; he didn't do it) and a subsequent investigation, but the ending scene has him on the space ship leaving earth as he says "For someone who was never meant for this world, I must confess, I'm suddenly having a hard time leaving it. Of course, they say every atom in our bodies was once a part of a star. Maybe I'm not leaving; maybe I'm going home."

I never deeply interrogated my attachment to this film, but I can guess it came from a few sources. There was the beautiful orchestral score, the intentionally spare set pieces and script, a post-Pulp Fiction and pre-Kill Bill Uma Thurman. But mostly I think I was attached to the arc of someone succeeding in a place he was not ever meant to be. I had watched the film at an age when I could not escape thoughts about career and future, and I was consuming without caution the autobiographies and biographies of the great theoretical physicists of the twentieth century. Gell-Mann, Feynman, Dyson, Tomonaga, Schwinger. Their pre-college life stories were all so different from mine in superficial and profound ways, but still  I began entertaining the idea that I too could become a physicist. In the narrator I saw a mirror of myself, and in the scenes with him doing inverted sit-ups weighted by a large celestial mechanics tome, I saw a metaphor for how I too might find a way home/I too might succeed. 

But there are necessary questions in selecting, if only unintentionally, such a mirror. That the narrator is considered by his society to be inferior to the more genetically curated humans is a basic premise of the story, one that it spends the entire time questioning, but one which is nevertheless made plain in the leaps through fire-crested hoops the narrator must go through in order to hide who he is. If I indeed saw myself in the narrator, did I too think that I was inferior to those around me? Did I look around at my peers and see people who I thought were in some way better than me, and, consequently, did I only believe I could gain some measure of the success I desired by making up for that inferiority with tenacity and commitment? 

Yes. 

First, I'd like to say that I came from a good home. My parents left Nigeria in the late 1980s and eventually settled in the West Bank of New Orleans. My sister was born first and I shortly followed, and while we were growing up my parents simply assumed my sister and I would do well in school. As the first child, my sister faced the initial brunt of these expectations but she met them and exceeded them. I remember in her sixth grade graduation ceremony, she won many academic awards, and afterwards parents and teachers came up to my mother and father to congratulate them and pose the only semi-rhetorical question of whether I was as capable as my sister. Much of my life I was trying my best to follow my sister's lead. I only began to deviate from her path in my junior year when I started to learn physics. But even this was propelled by her. While she was a junior and I was a sophomore, I came home one day to find her highly focused on a Princeton Review A.P. physics text book. I had no idea what physics was. I only knew of its reputation as something abstruse and impossible, and yet here was my sister studying a text which ostensibly concerned "Physics," and seemed to also discuss the equally impossible subject "Calculus." I cannot remember when exactly in the school year I came home to see this, but it doesn't really matter. As an algebra II student, I wasn't at all prepared to learn calculus or physics. Instead, I borrowed my sister's pre-calculus book during spring break and worked through the three chapters on trigonometry. Months later, I saw a calculus text on my Algebra II teacher's desk and asked to borrow it for the summer.  The text was one of the massive ones that includes both single and multi-variable calculus, so by the end of the summer I was on the cusp of learning multivariable integration. But August came, and I had to return the book. Fortunately, my sister, although still in high school, was taking Organic Chemistry at the University of New Orleans and was issued a student ID. She gave me her ID and let me check out books from the University library under her name. I checked out books on vector calculus, classical mechanics, and electromagnetism. But the library didn't have everything so I had to ask my parents to buy me more books. That year I would return home each day and read a section from one of these many books and work on problems. I didn't get much sleep that year, but I did learn a lot of physics. 

All of this learning occurred in my junior year, and it was the subsequent summer that I saw the film Gattaca. It was in the MITES program, an academic program for high school students part of ethnic/racial groups typically not found in the higher echelons of science in academia or industry.

see two parents faced with the decision of determining for their progeny how 

The film does not a consider a potentially more interesting question—a question the real-world may soon face—of what kinds of people have access to such technologies and what does this differential in access mean for how we already currently sort people. Rather the film the question poses is simpler: In a society in which success can be pre-manufactured at a genetic level, what sort of life can someone who is, by definition, genetically inferior carve out for him or herself?

 I never deeply interrogated why, or what my attachment to the movie might have implied about how I saw myself and the world around me. I enjoyed the orchestral score, the intentionally bare settings, and most of all the arc of the story. It was the underdog story overlaid with science. And I saw myself in the image of the underdog. 

But there are necessary questions in such a mirror. Did I see myself as genetically inferior to my peers and only capable of success through dint of hard work and effort? To be honest, yes. But I only felt inferior to a subset of my peers, those who could look to the history of mathematics and physics and did not require huge imaginative efforts to see themselves in the famous ones. I needed someway to rationalize to myself why I could still work towards this goal for which I had no known antecedents. Is such a direct correspondent necessary? Do people really need to have someone who is "like them" in some surface-level demographic way for them to be able to identify with a profession and see themselves in it? Are people so lacking in imagination and courage that they can not only fail to see themselves in places where others have not gone, but even if they manage to gain such vision have no desire to make any initial steps forward? 

As some one who has routinely done well on standardized tests and has found them to be largely irrelevant in the subsequent spaces to which they have granted me access, I have never really trusted IQ tests. Rather, I have always felt that a better measure of someone's intelligence was how much stock they were willing to put in a single number which supposedly defined that intelligence. Mostly, I see it as an ego trip, a way for the insecure to present evidence to the world as to why they are as intelligent as they incessantly claim themselves to be. Surely, if you were really so smart, you'd be using those smarts to do something useful in the world rather than just talking about it? 

I am sure IQ tests measure something, but it is quite clear that they do not measure all dimensions of intellectual activity of value. 

I wonder how some of their favorite writers, musicians, and directors would fare on an IQ test, and, presuming they did not fare well, would they still care as much about the results as they do when they are trying to sort populations? 

Do you think I have a higher IQ than John von Nuemann? The choice of individual is illustrative. Why select someone routinely selected as part of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century? Why not someone listed as one of the greatest biologists? Or even someone who is one of the greatest novelists? Or artists? There is something we mean when we talk about "raw intelligence" and we tend to know or believe we know from history who has the most of it. Mathematicians and scientists, yes. Artists, writers, and musicians, no. This might be part of the reason I never trusted IQ tests. I imagine some of my favorite writers and musicians won't fare too well on it, not because they aren't intelligent but just because what these tests feature don't seem to judge anything at all relevant to what these artists work on. 

The truth 

Clarence Thomas 

This is historically backwards. The people of America do not think that black people and latinos are routinely unqualified for the positions they attain because of affirmative action. Affirmative action was necessary because the people of America have thought that black people and latinos are routinely unqualified for the positions they attain. To be more honest, "Routinely unqualified" is a euphemism. Intellectually and dispositionally inferior, is a more accurate characterization of how black the darker races were viewed. 

Maybe they are simply idealists, substituting the world as it exists for the world as they hope it to exist. 

And it need not be true for anyone to think such things currently, since their forbears—whose thoughts on the matter were unambiguous given the policies they instituted—laid down the foundation and built the structures to codify such prejudices into law.

The whole debate is largely frustrating with the two of them talking past each other, but at one point Sam Harris says something which was like a beacon shining on the ocean. In response to a… Harris rashly responded "The weight of history is irrelevant." 

"The weight of history is irrelevant." 

All of a sudden it became clear what the argument was about, what all arguments about IQ are about and what largely the argument for or against affirmative action is about. One one side you have the people who think "the entire weight of history is irrelevant" and on the other side you have people who disagree. 

I should say that I don't think the entire weight of history is ever irrelevant. In fact it often is the most relevant and most rarely referenced thing in the room. When I was in high school I never liked history, too

Commenting on his string of rejections Michael Wang said "I think I deserve better than what I got.". Which from a quick glance sounded to me like a strange way to phrase the predicament. It was as if in preparation for his transition into whiteness, he seems to be practicing the entitlement so stereotypically endemic of the group he desperately seeks to be a part of. These days the only people who seem to deserve things (like rights or life) are the same people who have always deserved such things. I mean surely the dozens of unarmed people killed by police deserved better than being treated as the unfortunate casualties in the proper functioning of an ethical system. 

 There is no question as to rather the people killed by police deserved better. Indeed the rulings in our justice system suggest that they were casualties in the proper functioning of a working system. 
The way these intra-minority battles seem to work is that a new group comes to America, exists for a while in the liminal space between whiteness and blackness, and only eventually transitions to whiteness when it agrees, if only silently, to accept America's historical and continuing degradation of black Americans as merely par for the course and not at all one of the more pressing ethical problems of the country. 

Rather than questions, these activists have answers. Rather than "Why do we have affirmative action?" we have "There shouldn't be affirmative action."

Why do th Physics is to the physical world, what history is to our world of social and political structures. It is what you get when you keep asking "Why?". Nominally intelligent people strangely aren't interested in such questions, rather their more interested in using their intelligent to acquire as much goods for themselves and people like them 
What does it mean 
The weight of history is never irrelevant. Rather than a relevance concerning the weight of history, A better question is whether people carry that weight in the superficial demographic characteristic [contexts? which are not superficial] they were born with and whether such carrying affects one's identity and  changes how said person navigates through the world in a way largely disconnected from the choices they make. I would say yes. Each person in some way carries with him or her the implications of the decisions made by past ancestors, and these implications are made manifest not only in our parents socioeconomic status but also the color of our skin [No. Bolaji, this does not make sense. The color of one's skin is not clearly a consequence of ancestral decisions in a way similar to how socioeconomic status is.

Even if the question were conclusively proved to be a yes, there follows the necessary question of what to do with this fact? Our individual histories are different and our ancestral histories are different and these histories can only partly be gleaned from our ethnicity so how should ethnicity factor into how the gate keepers to economic prestige evaluate potential applicants?

Why I felt inferior in spite of my parents protection and example. James Baldwin and my sense of intelligence. Baldwin's comments about history. 
What history tells us about these attempts. Price of the Ticket. Why this seems different. Asian Americans will not be considered white. But it is possible that they will like Cubans…

Problems with Affirmative Action
People (Supreme Court Justices, college applicants, their parents) see a number of problems with affirmative action. It harms the fight for racial equality by making race still a relevant factor for employment and admissions decisions. It leads to a privileging of certain racial groups over others and therefore constitutes the very racial discrimination it is ostensibly meant to correct. By inviting suspicion that members of these groups only got into a certain college or got some high ranking position because of their specific demographic status, it causes rational people to question the competency of the groups it was meant to support. According to this latter claim, the argument goes, the policy not only undermines people's faith in educational and media institutions themselves, but also erodes the liberal belief that all groups of people have equal aptitude and the supposed liberal copout that it is the structure of our social and economic systems which lead to the wealth and employment stratification we see today. For surely, if people did truly have equal abilities and aptitudes, then the CEOs of fortune 500 companies, our Senate, our inner cities, and not to mention the universities would not look the way they do. 

Unfortunately, race (and gender) are still relevant factors for employment decisions even without the explicit edict of affirmative action. For reasons which are perhaps uncomfortable for employers to articulate, a white man with the same qualifications as a black man makes a better fit for the desired job, and women require much more deliberate demonstrations of independence and competence before people are willing to attach to them the label of "leader." Affirmative action doesn't automatically lead to the privileging of black applicants over white applicants regardless of qualifications. Moreover, even if privileging were to occur in this way, promoting a few lucky individuals from a socially disadvantaged group for a few decades does little to reverse or stem the continual, centuries-in-the-making cost for the larger majority of individuals who the policy does not touch. And the claim that rational people think black people, hispanic people, and women are unqualified for the jobs they attain because of affirmative action is historically backwards. Affirmative action is necessary because of cultural and social narratives which presumed these groups were unqualified for the jobs they were preemptively barred or turned away from, and which thus prevented them from gaining the critical mass of occupants to even begin to consistently challenge these ideas about qualification. 

Then again there are those who believe the only reason race appears to be important is because it is really just a layer above the larger (one might even say "more inclusive") and more relevant category of socioeconomic status.  A common line is that Obama's daughters have had greater advantages than a white family in the lowest-income bracket living in the economically ravaged rust belt. This argument assumes that admissions officers are stupid, namely that they cannot parse the intersection of socioeconomics and race in a way which would accurately evaluate the relative advantages of being born into a family which will eventually occupy the White House versus being born into a family whose head of households struggle to find continuous employment. Moreover, it reveals much about one's sense of the racial politics in this country that in order to find a reasonable comparison between black people and white people which illustrates the relevance of socioeconomic status, one must compare the progeny of our modern versions of royalty to the anonymous children of economically disenfranchised parents who are part of a socially advantaged demographic group. Why not choose a more pedestrian example? How about a white family and a black family in the lowest socioeconomic bracket? How about the opioid crisis and the crack epidemic as a more useful comparison of how our country navigates a common socioeconomic problem across differing racial and demographic contexts?

Correlation and Causation: Necessary but not Sufficient
The "correlation = causation" logical fallacy gets a bad rap, undoubtedly because it seems to be such a clear example of sloppy reasoning, but possibly also because it exemplifies another common logical fallacy.  If you measure one quantity across individuals in a population and you then measure another quantity and find that a scatter plot for the two quantities has a decidedly clear trend line, you can only conclude that the two quantities are somehow causally related if you believe that the truth of a statement requires that its converse to also be true. The true statement is that if A causes B, then A and B are correlated. The converse of this true statement, and the heart of the "causation=correlation" fallacy, is that if A and B are correlated then A causes B (or vice versa). But of course, the converse of true statements can indeed be false. Consider the statements "If I live in the Alabama, then I live in the United States," or the statement "If I like all vegetables then I like broccoli." Each example is largely one concerning sets and subsets, and the "converse" fallacy is the mistaken presumption that simply because X is a subset of Y, then when we choose an element of Y we are also choosing an element of X. 

Outside of its relation to the converse fallacy, the "causation-correlation" fallacy can also be seen as a consequence of the common inaccurate perception of the potency of mathematics. Perhaps people see statistics as a magical crank which like all of mathematics lends legitimacy and truth to all statements framed in its language. But a tool can only give you useful results if it is applied to problems consistent with its spectrum of purposes. This is not to say that tools cannot gain new purposes, only to say that although a sledge hammer could be used as a door stop it likely could not be used as a table. Statistical methods cannot be used inaccurately as a way to imbue qualitative analyses with a veneer of quantitative legitimacy. The statistical nature of a correlation makes no reference to causation because in computing correlations between variables the functional relationship which provides the first indication of a causative relationship is often not present. And even if such a relationship were present, it would not be correct to say that the independent variable causes the dependent variable unless one had a better sense of the metaphysics of the underlying model which relates the two.

The utility of correlations is that they point us towards variables which may be related. After finding a correlation. we can use its existence as a motivation for finding some deeper relationship. The correlation then becomes the starting point rather than the conclusion. It exists as a necessary condition which makes clear the possibility of a connection ever before one even begins the search for explanations that can make the connection explicit in a causal way. Correlation does not imply Causation, but because Causation necessitates Correlation, we can use the subset of variables which we know are correlated to focus our search concerning causative factors. 

And most likely this search will have to be completed outside of statistics. Statistics which allows us to establish correlations is a useful first step, after which a subject which can deal with the nature of the relevant variables more deeply has to take over. It is in much the same way that one can use mathematics to deductively obtain logical relationships between mathematically modeled quantities but the relationship these mathematical quantities have to the world is not established until one does the additional work of determining whether the implications of the model match what we observe in the situations the model supposedly represents. 

All of this is to say that although it is a mistake to believe that correlation implies causation, it is not so egregious to render correlations completely useless in seeking out causations.

Loose Ends

-The statistical nature of a correlation, makes no reference to causation because there is no underlying 

-Simply because a statement is true does not in turn require that its converse be true. Specifically, just because causation implies correlation does not in turn mean that correlation implies causation. Partly, the fallacy can also be seen as a fundamental limitation of statistics and people with a poor knowledge of statistics inability to recognize this limitation and to see it as a magical crank which like all of mathematics must lend legitimacy and truth to all statements framed in its language. This belief leads to a use of statistics in a way quite different from its methods imply. 

-A correlates with B implies that A causes B if A occurs before B; otherwise B causes A. 

-It's such a common mistake of statistical analyses that professional statisticians think of it as a bane on logical reasoning. This is a mistake of 

-Statistics answers some questions concerning relationships and significance, but it says nothing about causes. How incredible would the subject be if it did? Imagine that instead of merely saying that one variable is related to another, you could show how and why they were related? You could derive from this relationship a predictive model suggesting what you would need to do to change the nature of the relationship and perhaps something even pointing to some deeper question which tells you how variables you never before even considered are related to one another. But statistics cannot do this. It is a tool and one must not mistake the capabilities of the tool for the spectrum of answers which are interesting or should be sought. Simply because we can only find correlations through statistics doesn't mean that correlations are the only things which we should seek out.

The Weight of History

In April of 2018, Ezra Klein and Sam Harris had a podcast discussion about race, IQ, and political correctness. This discussion was precipitated by an earlier podcast discussion between Sam Harris and Charles Murray which was itself motivated by the then recent protests of Murray at Middlebury College. The protests featured Murray and his host professor being virtually run out of an auditorium and then nearly assaulted by protestors who saw great danger in Murray's book The Bell Curve. In one chapter of the book, Murray and his coauthor Hernstein argued that there were differences in the IQ distributions across races (with the black people having the lowest average IQ), and, in the final chapter, they suggested that these differences should change social policy like welfare and affirmative action. The book was written more than two decades ago, and at Middlebury Murray was slated to discuss an entirely different topic. Still, the protestors came in full force. 

In the podcast between Murray and Harris, Murray discussed The Bell Curve and Harris asked him some questions about it, mostly focusing his concern on what he saw as the unfair treatment of Murray by a fanatically politically correct press. Unsurprisingly, people viewed Harris's invitation and subsequent soft-balled discussion as an indication that he actually supported Murray's analysis and that he was racially insensitive, supportive of racists, or simply racist himself. A few publications released articles critiquing the general framing of Harris's and Murray's discussion, but Vox (where Ezra Klein is the editor) released a piece much longer and more comprehensive than all the rest. It featured a number of psychologists discussing in detail the current science concerning the relationship between race and IQ and pointing out the flaws in Murray's conclusions and ultimately admonishing Harris for the uncritical level of his discussion. Harris was incensed by this article, and ended up calling out Ezra Klein for being unfair to him. This led to a long email correspondence between the two where they tried to work out an adult resolution. Maybe an open discussion on a podcast? It was a good suggestion, one that Harris agreed to, but then rescinded his agreement because he eventually saw it as unproductive. That is until the NYT released an article seemingly affirming Harris's position, Harris re-tweeted the article at Ezra Klein with a sarcastic comment, and then Klein responded by posting a long article titled "Sam Harris, Charles Murray, and the allure of race science
," which only further pissed of Harris ultimately leading him to release to the internet their presumably confidential email correspondence. But it seemed that by early April the childishness was over and a face-to-face discussion was the only thing left to do. 

When I first listened to the discussion between Klein and Harris, I could not help but feel frustrated. The two seemed to mostly talk past one another with Harris explaining how unfairly he was treated and asserting that liberals are hypocritically intolerant to certain conversations, and Klein responding that there was a context to this discussion about race and IQ which was much larger and more trenchant than Harris's hurt feelings or the modern notions of political correctness. This cycle continued back and forth until more than halfway through the podcast, when Harris and Klein had a short exchange which was like a lighthouse beacon cutting through the fog. 

Ezra Klein

I think there is what you would call confusion here. I do think that it's just important to say this. I have not criticized you, and I continue to not, for having the conversation. I've criticized you for having the conversation without dealing with and separating it out and thinking through the context and the weight of American history on it. 

Sam Harris 

The weight of American history is completely irrelevant…that part of the conversation has been had. You don't need to talk about slavery. You don't have to talk about the specific injustices in the past to have a conversation about environmental factors that very likely keep people back. 


"The weight of American history is completely irrelevant." The sentence struck me when Harris first said it, and reverberated around my head for days afterwards. "The weight of American history is completely irrelevant." It confused me how an intelligent person could have even a cursory knowledge of the history of black people in the Americas look, and believe that said history is irrelevant to the current discussion about black intelligence. But all of a sudden it became clear to me that there was a different way to frame this argument and to frame all arguments about race and IQ and even affirmative action: On one side of these debates you have the people who think "the entire weight of history is irrelevant" and on the other side you have people who disagree. 

Once of my physics instructors once posed a question to the class: "What is physics?" There were some standard and entirely correct answers concerning matter and energy and interactions, but by far the most perceptive answer was the simplest. A student said "Physics is what you get when you keep asking 'Why?'" Why is the sky blue? Why do you feel pushed to the side of a fast turning car? Why is water more dense than ice? All of these questions about the physical world eventually degenerate into some more specific physics question when you work through all the 'Why's?

And it seems that what physics does for the physical world, history does for our world's social and political structures. Like physics, History is what you get when you keep asking 'Why?' but about an entirely different set of questions. Why is America such a geographically large country? Why did America invade Afghanistan and Iraq even though the 9/11 attackers hailed from Saudi Arabia? Why do black people do more poorly on IQ tests or their proxies than other races? Why are there so few black students represented in the institutions of high educations? Why is test taking and preparation such a seemingly large part of a Chinese American student's upbringing and not as large a part of an African American student's upbringing? 

Why is race a category of human demographics to begin with? 

History is about narratives and interpretation about cause and effect and most of all about the fact that although it may not be clear that everything that happens has meaning, everything certainly happens for a reason, and with effort, luck, and patience—and most of all a desire to find out—you can find that reason if you seek it out. But I understand why some people aren't interested in seeking it out, I understand the pull of modernity which makes one believe all the relevant information in the world can be discerned from a rational and ahistorical analysis of what seems like the most fair and most equitable thing to do given where we are now. Of course free speech makes sense and people should publish whatever books they want about whatever topic they want. And off course it makes sense that admissions to an academic university should be based on solely academic factors. 

But the weight of history is never irrelevant. It was not irrelevant to me when I was growing up in New Orleans. It is not irrelevant to the debate as cyclic and as constant as the seasons concerning black intelligence. And it it not irrelevant to the debate concerning affirmative action. And most of all it is not irrelevant to the children of immigrants who have recently come to this country, know and care little for its history, but nevertheless feel entitled to alter its institutions to provide them with greater rewards. 

I started doing research in my sophomore year of college, and that’s when I realized there was a divide between courses and research. The change that occurred in grad school was that I started trying to implement in my own education ideas about how to bridge that divide in my own education. 

[Additional Note] 

Harris disagreed with the policing/silencing/? of Murray and his work The Bell Curve because he sees these acts as manifestations of identity politics. He in turn sees identity politics as people making claims about their reality that stem from their identity rather than from reality itself. He sees it as non-objective as filtering the world and interpretations of it through the way they affect you rather than through a more distant more rational analysis. 

I don't know. I think people's identity inevitably affects the reality they experience and their interpretations of that reality because that identity is part of reality itself. One should consider one's vantage when looking at something, but claiming that one could or should see without the vantage at all is limiting?/incorrect?/foolhardy, and those who claim they are able to do so, should not be trusted.

Resolving the Simulation and Analytical Results Contradiction
I am in the process of editing the second draft of my paper "Self-Assembly of a Dimer System". Rostam fortunately gave me really great comments on my first draft, one of which was to better justify my simulation results.

 In the first version of the paper, each point in the plot of simulation results represents the average of the final 200 steps in a 10,000 step simulation. Rostam asked me why I chose these numbers. I stated that I assumed that after ~10,000 simulation steps the system should have reached its thermal equilibrium and I could use the final 200 steps of that supposed equilibrium as an ensemble of states from which averages could be computed. Returning to the simulation I decided to still believe in this argument, but rather than each point representing the average computed from a single simulation, I made each point represent the average of the averages of 100 simulations. As a result my simulation results for all of the example systems (Type I, Type II, edge of Type I and II) became much cleaner. However, with these cleaner simulation results it also became clear how much these simulation results differed from the analytical predictions. 

In the first draft of the paper, the Type II system is the one which appears to have the greatest difference between analytical and simulation results. I initially assumed that this was just a statistical fluctuation that didn't need to be further explicated, but after improving my simulations this difference remained. In particular, the analytical results predict that for Type II systems, as  the temperature increases beyond , the curve for  becomes convex, but when I simulate the system I find that the simulated results are decidedly concave. 

Now, I am trying to figure out why there is this difference only in the case for the Type II system. 

One thing I have observed is that my simulation results seem to depend on my initial state. Something silly inside me is thinking about pursuing the possibility that, in contradiction to equilibrium thermodynamics, where this self-assembly system begins in state space does affect its long-time equilibrium behavior. More seriously, what I am likely observing is that for the simulation times I have chosen, the system is settling into metastable equilibria which are not fully captured in analyses (like the partition function methods I am using) which compute the true free energy minima of systems. 

A possibility is that my analytical results are incorrect. This is by far the most interesting possibility since I am quite sure the analytical results follow unambiguously from partition function which itself follows unambiguously from the original description of state spaces and binding energies. Also, I didn't merely compute the critical points of the effective free energy for this system. I also ensured that these critical points were stable. Finally, the analytical results appear to be correct for Type I and edge of Type I and II systems, so if it is true that these results do not accurately model Type II systems it would require a deeper explanation for why they don't work in this particular case. I suppose all of this is to say that I think the analytical results are likely fine, but if there was some layer beneath them that I was not investigating and which was leading to these anomalous results, then it would pull the paper and my supposed knowledge of this subject in a decidedly different direction. 


The other likely possibility is that the analytical results are fine,  and given the way I have set up transition steps, I am just not exploring the state space for Type II systems as efficiently as I need to for my chosen simulation time. What is incredibly interesting about the comparison between the equilibrium predictions and the simulation results is that if, in your simulation, you begin in a state which is far from equilibrium, choose to short a simulation time, or choose a collection of transition steps which require you to take many steps to reach equilibrium, then the long-time behavior of your simulation can be quite different from your equilibrium results. Making the issue even more confusing, you cannot really look to the analytical equilibrium results for clues as to how to change the simulation, because these equilibrium results make no comment concerning the absolute values of transition rates. Instead, you have to think carefully about the best ways to "efficiently" travel around your state space to ensure that all the states which contribute to the partition function appear in the simulation. 

I tried to do this by including an unphysical "Dimer Cross-Over" transition in the simulation. For an actual dimer system, one would expect the only possible ways for the system to change from one time to another is for dimers to dissociate or for monomers to associate. But restricting myself to these two transition types led to the system (even for the Type I parameter regime) getting stuck in states which were not true free-energy minima and which were thus not manifest in the analytical results. I only was able to reproduce the predictions for Type I systems by including a third transition step in which two dimers could switch one each of their constituent monomers. For each time step, I said the system had a probability of 1/3 each of undergoing a monomer association, dimer dissociation, or a dimer cross-over and this transition scheme did work well for both Type I and edge of Type I and II systems. But it does not reproduce the equilibrium behavior of Type II systems. 

This suggests to me that this transition scheme is not efficient enough for these Type II systems. To make it work, I would need to do one (or a combination) of three things: 

Lengthen the simulation time - This is a brute force route which will make all my simulations take longer and should only be pursued as a last resort. 

Change probability weights for the transitions - The choice of 1/3 probability each for the various types of transitions was largely arbitrary. What if I change this probability for choice of transition type to be dependent on the current state of the system? Or, what if I changed it to be a constant different value (e.g., 1/4 probability each for association and dissociation but a 1/2 probability for dimer cross-over)

Change the third transition step - Maybe I can change the dimer cross-over of the third transition step to include the substitution of a free monomer for one of the monomer components of the dimer. 
My guess is this last suggested change is the least likely to be healthful since the simulation's deviation from analytical results is most evident when the system is entirely composed of dimers. Thus allowing one of the monomer components of a dimer to be switched out with a free monomer wouldn't change the transition state properties of the system when it is in such a state. 

Currently, I think b) is the best way forward, specifically finding a way to make the probability for choice of transition type more dependent on the current state of the system with dimer cross-overs being more likely when the system is entirely composed of dimers.

MITES, Affirmative Action, and Ability

But there are necessary questions in selecting, if only unintentionally, such a mirror. That the narrator is considered by his society to be inferior to the more genetically curated humans is a basic premise of the story, one that it spends the entire time questioning, but one which is nevertheless made plain in the leaps through fire-crested hoops the narrator must go through in order to hide who he is. If I indeed saw myself in the narrator, did I too think that I was inferior to those around me? Did I look around at my peers and see people who I thought were in some way better than me, and, consequently, did I only believe I could gain some measure of the success I desired by making up for that inferiority with tenacity and commitment? 

Yes. 

Some context is required. I first watched Gattaca at MIT in the summer of 2008. It was in the institute's Mechanical Engineering department in a classroom whose windows overlooked the southern border of the campus quadrangle. I was not a student at the time. Rather, I and about 60 other rising high school juniors were partway through the MITES academic program.  The MITES program took students from across the U.S. and put them through a simulated first-semester college curriculum featuring a Calculus, Biology/Chemistry/Biochemistry, Physics, and Writing course and a selection from Mechanical, Electrical, and Biological engineering electives. The courses were taught by faculty and graduate students from the Boston and Cambridge area and had weekly assignments, exams, and class projects. And aside from the flight tickets to and from campus, the program was completely free. 

Outside of class, the program organized tours, weekly career seminars, and movie sessions for the students. 
It was during one of the movie sessions that I saw Gattaca. Given the film's heavy-handed questions about bioethics, it was an apt choice for a science and engineering summer program, but given the demographic composition of the program there was a subtext to the film's viewing which could not be escaped. MITES stands for Minority Introduction to Engineering and Science and it began. Consequently, 

Given that MITES is a science and engineering program, Gattaca was an apt choice for a film because it provided a concrete thought experiment through which students could consider the implications of technological advancement on society. But given the demographic composition of the program, one could also glean a more subtle message in this choice. MITES, standing for Minority Introduction to Engineering and Science, first began in the 1970s with the express goal of increasing the percentage of underrepresented minorities in engineering (and later science). Consequently, a majority of the students who attend the program are Black, Latino, or American Indian. 

The book Technology and the Dream is a collection of interviews of black students who attended MIT between 1941 and 1999 and what one finds in the post-1970 autobiographical introductions is that many of these students were first exposed or introduced to MIT through the MITES program. In fact that is one of the major allures of the program: Students who attend MITES end up going to MIT, Stanford, Harvard, U.C. Berkeley, or other similarly selective colleges in the U.S. 

In this way MITES falls into the category of pre-college programs which serve as conduits to the the higher rankings in the U.S. news and world reports for colleges. It's a program like TASP, RSI, or PROMYS, programs that when they appear in a student's application in college seem to correlate quite highly with the student being accepted into the college. Of course one must allow for the possibility that the students who are accepted into these programs already have academic qualifications high enough to merit acceptance into excellent universities even if they had not attended these programs.  

But unlike these programs MITES was not purely a program which sought out academic excellence, brought that excellence into a single place, and then worked to grouw it. The program was for a particular kind of student, one that it viewed would benefit most greatly from the opportunities that MITES provided. Students who had never thought about college, who had parents who did not attend college, or did not have the financial resourced to do all the many things which could help a college application move forward. Unquiestionably, then, MITES was and is an affirmative action program, one whose mission if not explicitly stated was to make a small step in recyitfying the centuries old restriction of certain groups from science and technology positions.

Meta-writing on Project
I am trying to find a solid through-line for my current writing project. Roughly, the current list of topics is Gattaca, MITES, Affirmative Action, Black Intelligence, Race and IQ, Harris and Klein debates, and the Relevance of History. I originally wanted to begin the essay by discussing why Gattaca is my favorite movie, but I've realized that such a framing would require me to make too many segue-leaps in order to get to the main topic. Also what is that main topic? I know that the stem of the essay is my personal experience with affirmative action and arguments about race and IQ, and what this personal experience might suggest about the attempts to dissolve the latter and solidify the former, but I am not sure how to connect this stem to the tendrils concerning Gattaca, affirmative action, and the Klein and Harris Debates. I think one way forward is not to begin with Gattaca, but with a more general story from which my experience with Gattaca can be seen as an example. Maybe begin the essay with my experience of reading Baldwin in my second year of graduate school and at last, shamefully, feeling as though I had concrete relateable evidence that black people were not in some fundamental way a people lesser than all others.

Meta-writing surplus

The essential nature of tokenism is to feel as though one has to represent and stand in for a populace much larger than oneself. Your thoughts become their thoughts. Your weakness, their weakness. Your prejudices, their prejudices. And of course the transfer works in the opposite direction with the features of the populace flowing back onto you, seemingly substituting what is personal in yourself with what is shared by the larger group of people who look like you. You don't really have any choice in this. No matter how you are, what you are obscures your idiosyncrasies and, as a result, you are inevitably painted as merely one of a much more general kind. Or I suppose you have a single particular choice. It is the choice common to all who have relinquished or lost any power to affect change in the space they occupy. You can leave. This is something I was contemplating back in my second year of graduate school. Should I stay, or should I go? I think I meant this in a metaphysical sense. There was no real place for me to go again (or at least I thought so), so if I were leaving, it would be the final departure everyone eventually makes, rarely of their own volition. This should strike you as melodramatic. I certainly think so now. But back then it felt like I was making my last fitful strokes in a rough black ocean, and although I could see the sun in the distance the clouds were approaching and I was quite rapidly losing my way. 

When one looks back on times like these, the tendency is to lend a heroic narrative to a story which eventually concludes, if not in triumph, at least in an escape from failure. I succeeded because of X. Or I managed to find myself because of Y. I could present such a narrative but it would be dishonest, having the flair of a revisionist account of my emotional state of mind, and thus you the reader although having a sense of the facts of my predicament would be denied the deeper knowledge of how they felt at the time. Subsequently, any understanding you believe you're walking away with would be marginal and I would have cheated both of us out of some more authentic form of communion. So if I am going to convey this story I have to do so as if it was occurring in real time, as though I believe that tomorrow might be the last day I will decide to wake up and face the world, as though the demons who haunted me so long ago, haunt me still. 

I am a second year PhD student in Harvard's Department of Physics. I have managed to get here through some murky concoction of effort, talent, and most of all luck. Lucky to be born at the time I was born. Lucky to be born to the parents to whom I was born. Lucky to have made it all the way here to this place in spite of all other places I could be and all other people who could be here instead. But I do not feel lucky. I feel terrified. I am terrified that I have arrived only to have forever lost whatever made me take the journey in the first place. I have lost my interest and my curiosity in physics, and with this thing gone I am rudderless, conscripted into a path laid out for me until at last the path ejects me onto another plane in which I must somehow subsume a more independent identity. I have managed to make it through a year with this feeling. A year where each week I would work myself into stupidity by Friday and spend the weekend locked in my room, shower-less, with sporadic visits to the hallway vending machines to buy pre-packaged pound cake. Each Monday I would go through a purge in which I fled to the gym, and cycled or ran the shame away, only to begin accumulating it all again the subsequent weekend. That year was the most difficult because it was the first. But now that I have no classes, and now that I need to find some research area to which I will dedicate my next five-odd years (or perhaps my life), I am paralyzed. 

I attend the classes of a potential research advisor. Or, rather, a former potential research advisor. We had been working together unofficially since the beginning of the year, but he told me months ago that he was officially taking on a new student and that new student was not me. This was a message of kindness. He was trying to grant me more time to find someone else to work with, someone else to serve as an academic mid-wife who would help me birth new knowledge into the world. But I was sticky. By this time, I have done so much work. Could it all be for naught? No, I decide. He might not want me as a student but I can at least get something concrete to which I could point to years down the line, something which would convince me that it was not all a waste. So I commit to continue working with him until I hopefully manage to write a paper representing the culmination of all our work. But the work is still far from complete, and it is now placed upon me the duty of finishing a project that I am only marginally interested in. So the days stretch, and each morning I wake up from my second floor room in the depths of Brighton, take the 66 or the 86 to Harvard Square, and walk to the Harvard Law school library where I work for a few hours before falling asleep on a couch. 

I do not know what I am doing. I am floundering. I am lost. I take solace in a quote from Junot Diaz: "If you are not lost, you are in some place someone else has already found." The advantage of such found-places is that they often come with maps lending security to a journey which is otherwise fraught, but the implicit disadvantage is that by following such maps you are denying yourself the opportunity to discover something new, something personally affirming which would allow you to develop such maps, and future ones, on your own. But inspirational words can only frame a mindset: What remains is the work which the mindset can only encourage the body to do, and nothing but patience and focus and courage and faith could lead to the ultimate completion of that work. And by now, I am waning, fading day by day. Going through the motions of a graduate student, no longer even believing that these motions will take me to some place much better than where I am. 

And unfortunately I am internally at war, one part of myself battling for the determination of a professional identity and another part battling for the articulation of a sexual one which had been determined long ago. The problem with being lost is that it is often concomitant with being lonely and although one without the other is debilitating, both of them together is potentially fatal. I know what I feel, but I also know that I am hiding it. Hiding it from my family and my friends, not for my own protection (I tell myself) but for theirs. They have developed a sense of who I am, a sense which was arguably a fiction but certainly a comforting one. Good fences. Good Neighbors. But I am discovering the thing that all those who willingly step into straitjackets discover: you either lose the will to struggle against the constraint—the face growing to fit the mask— or you lose your mind. I am experiencing the latter. Being in one's early twenties and never having experienced that special interpersonal intimacy so supposedly crucial to the human experience, one feels a clock ticking above one's head, one which when midnight is struck sees one converting into a pumpkin whose access to the human world has been forever cutoff. I had tried so fervently to find such intimacy with women and if I had been like the vast majority of my gender I would have certainly fallen into a despair whose destructiveness could decimate whatever connections I had managed to build up. But I am unlike the vast majority of my gender in that I am also attracted to people of that very same gender. I have known this since high school, but have managed to occupy myself with dreams of a career as a physicist and so I have never had to deal seriously with the implications of this recognition. Until of course those dreams seemed to recede beyond the horizon and I find myself looking in all directions for something, anything to hold onto to prolong my descent into some unknown depth.

This sense of disenchantment with physics, the consequent loss of identity and self, and the hope to find some other identity by cultivating the parts I had previously ignored. All this is perhaps what leads me to start reading James Baldwin in the late fall of 2015. Like me, Baldwin seemed out of place in his time. He was queer. He was black. He was oddly situated along any axis in the space of his more well known contemporaries. Was he a civil rights leader like King and X? Was he an African American writer like Wright and Ellison? Was he a public intellectual like Chomsky or Orwell? Or was he, like Vidal, an individual of dubious moral character who could potentially corrupt children?

I do not know. I want to find out. The first thing I choose is "Sonny's Blues." The story seems to come to me beyond a veil. Reading it, I feel that I am always just at the surface of something that I believe Baldwin is saying but since he never says this thing explicitly, I can never be completely sure that I heard it. And yet there is a message in Baldwin's exercising of this level of restraint. The narrator in the story is a school teacher and he talks about his brother Sonny. It appeared that for much of his life Sonny was lost and had found himself through music, or rather he had found music which had made his and any one else's evaluation of the "self" irrelevant. I wondered if I could do the same. 

The story is good, but every famous writer has at least one good story. Perhaps it is a fluke. From there I find a short article titled "On Being White…and other lies" where Baldwin discusses the "price of the ticket" for the trip across the Atlantic taken by European immigrants throughout America's long history. He claims that to take such a trip one must always pay for it and when coming to America the price that needed to be paid was explicit in the country's laws if not in the trip detail. Assimilation is needed for a cohesive political and national identity and this assimilation involves accepting the customs and beliefs of the culture one seeks to be a part of. For America back then, there was the idea of whiteness and its antithesis in blackness, and new comers to this country who had never experienced such a dichotomy were required to learn to live with it, to live it itself, in order to truly become Americans. In this way immigrants discovered upon setting foot on this land that they were not Italian, Irish, German, or Polish but rather that they were white and as white people they were not the same as people who were black. This is Baldwin's point: The price these citizens had to pay was the gradual relinquishing of their ethnic identities, and thus the process in which Africans were brought to this country erased of their origins and then given new identities came full circle to dictate the way all individuals who came to this country were processed through it. 

This is a novel point to me, one that I have never heard anyone make before: Dehumanization as a double edged sword. You deny someone their identity their origins their history and you replace it all with caricature. Then, you try to make the caricature the only reality there is by not only making sure that they live by it, but also by claiming that they have always lived by it, and before you know it you find yourself chopping off all the aspects of your own identity which might limit your ability to police the caricature.

By this point my experience with Baldwin is two-for-two. I now need to find a longer piece, something which could let me see how his powers were stretched and maintained in an extended argument. The work I choose is The Fire Next Time. It is not a coincidence that I choose Baldwin's most well known work; I find it in part because it was so well known. But from my later reading many of other Baldwin's essays and novels, I will soon realize I probably could not have gone wrong with any other selection. Written as a letter to a nephew, The Fire Next Time discusses race and racism in America circa 1960s. But unlike most black writers at the time who wrote about race, Baldwin's focus is not on how racism affected black Americans but on how it warped the reality of white Americans. 

***

Any person who finds him or herself in some professional tradition in which people who look like them are not frequently found often searches, perhaps unknowingly, for an indication that they have not been incorrectly placed, that they are supposed to, or at least allowed to, be where they currently are. I think I had been doing such searching ever since I started to learn physics because for black people in America, the professional tradition that they are scarcely found is any decidedly intellectual one. At MIT I was too focused on the work to pay particular attention to the optics of the demographically-lopsided classrooms I occupied, but when I came to Harvard the coincidence of my waning interest in physics and my return to Cambridge after a year away made me strangely more focused on these superficial markers of appropriateness and fit. But what my mind was drawn to was not reasons for why I should be here, but indications from peers, professors, and anonymous strangers that I did not belong. Of course I found such indicators. Professors who were dismissive of reasonable questions. Peers who responded in silence when I told them "good morning."  The liberal denizens of Harvard square giving me wide berths when I tried to ask for directions. These incidents were isolated, but the insecure mind is a vulnerable one and these cases were exacerbated completely out of proportion to their frequency. And most irrationally of all they all suggested to me that these things were happening because of the demographic optics I had previously ignored. I was black in a place that black people were not supposed to be, and my environment was just reacting appropriately. Thus, I could not be a physicist and the dreams harbored in youth were foolhardy and naive, failing as they did to take into account the personal limitations that would prevent their realization. 

In a way Baldwin saved me from myself. His writing was effervescent and clear, if dogmatic, and although he was certainly of the breed of author-philosophers, he had none of the syntactical artifice of the more well-known names of the 20th century. Baldwin was a writer, and I was not, and nor was I trying to be one, but this didn't matter. In Baldwin I managed to find affirmation for the idea that I could be a physicist. In his work, it was clear that he was faithful to the very letter of what scientists are purported to be faithful: he posed and explored questions that had never (or seldom) been publicly articulated. He was a scientist in spirit if not in practice and this gave me some confidence that I too could be a scientist. 

Moreover, Baldwin had never gone to graduate school, never even gone to college. And so all these American narratives about education and intelligence and race seemed to founder when one considered him. Knowledge of his work functioned to inoculate me against any of my own virulent insecurities gestating from youth or communicated by my navigation through Harvard. I may have been the lone black student in my graduate year, one of only six black students in a department of more than 200, but I had nothing to prove about intelligence or ability because Baldwin had already proved everything.

The problem with these supposedly liberal institutions of higher learning is that when ideals confront practice, people often hold on to professed ideals even if such ideals are arrayed in contradistinction to their every day practice. S

For some reason I was feeling the reality of my race more intensely, than I ever had before. Perhaps this was due to the structure of the first year graduate program in the Harvard physics department. All the first year students are given offices in the same general space. The result is that students work together, eat together, and relax together, with the clear goal that some sort of community is naturally created amongst cohorts. But the problem with intentional attempts to structure conditions under which communities naturally flourish, is that those who do not manage to find some footing or relational attachment in those communities feel rejected not only from the community itself but also from the body which sought to organize it. I think this is why the feeling of estrangement was so intense. It had seemed like everyone was making friends with everyone and I was off on my own for reasons I didn't understand.

Ticket to a Good Education

In high school, there was a phrase a few Chinese American students used to describe some of their more recently immigrated compatriots. "FOB" pronounced "FAHB" meant "Fresh off the Boat" which itself meant that those who were given this moniker stood out from their better assimilated friends in their inability to completely shed the accent, interest, and social networks of their original culture. The phrase always had the bearing of a joke, but like all jokes it also hinted at something deeper. 

America as a nation of immigrants cultivates in many cultures and nations a divide between people who have immigrated here and those who are still in their homeland. All cultures recognize that to become an American requires a dual process of renunciation and adoption, where one must learn to accept certain things about one's new country while relinquishing certain things about one's old. Of course, this process is common to all immigration experiences, but what is different in America is the way that accepting the American identity has always forced one to retrospectively refashion their former one. 

Years ago Baldwin spoke about the "price of the ticket" paid by European immigrants when they came to this country. America was—is? will forever be?—caught in the throes of the so called "Negro problem" in which white citizens were trying to find ways to parse the contradiction between their ideals for equality and justice with the historical facts of enslavement, Jim Crow, and segregation. While the country was doing its best to alternately work through or ignore this problem, it had to ensure that new immigrants were on the same page with the problem's current interpretations, the most salient of which was the idea of whiteness and its antithesis in blackness. New comers to this country who had never experienced such a dichotomy were required to learn to live with it, to live it itself, in order to truly become Americans.  In this way immigrants discovered upon setting foot on this land that they were not English, Italian, Irish, German, or Polish but rather that they were white. This was Baldwin's point: The price these citizens had to pay was the gradual relinquishing of their ethnic identities, and thus the process in which Africans were brought to this country erased of their origins and then given new identities came full circle to dictate the way all individuals who came to this country were processed through it.

It should be stated that this process was never explicit. It existed mostly in acceptance and silence and the desire for the new immigrants to make new and profitable lives for themselves within the current structure which had only unfortunately denied similar opportunities to so many others. Who were they to question a system that they simply wished to be a part of and benefit from? What, if anything, did the history of this country have to do with their attempts to work within said system?

I don't think the substance of the price of the ticket has changed all these years. The fact that first-generation students with roots in China, Vietnam, Malaysia, and India can be lumped together and identified as Asian Americans evidences this. And the arguments of the plaintiffs in SFFA's recent case against Harvard evidence this. Their desire is to remove the consideration of race in university admissions and to thereby move America closer to its meritocratic ideals, ideals which need not be contextualized by or make any reference to history, since one knows that our educational institutions cannot really do anything to repair the historical inadequacies/injustices/blah that they helped create. Of the course the reality of American meritocracy is difficult to discern given the known history of the various groups who have not been allowed to freely engage with it, but the idea of this reality is something that those who have operated and managed to find success within its limited version still like to believe. 

However, what is different about the price of the ticket in the current court case is the way it is being paid. In the 1922 case Takao Ozawo v. United States and the 1927 case Lum v. Rice recent East Asian immigrants lobbied for the fringe benefits of white citizenship by claiming that because they were not black, they must be considered white.  These plaintiffs were in essence supporting an ideology of the dominant (the idea of a white-black antithesis then common to America) by claiming to have the very identity of the dominant ( white people the people who fostered that ideology). Perhaps recognizing the basic logical fallacy of such arguments, the court rejected all of these appeals, but in today's SFFA v. Harvard case the plaintiffs are seeking to dismantle affirmative action on the basis that it discriminates against Asian Americans, in essence supporting an ideology of the dominant (the idea that America was, before affirmative action, a meritocracy) by professing an identity of the marginalized, one which ironically was foisted upon them by that dominant ideology. 

But immigrants from East Asia have been coming to America for much of the 20th century and affirmative action has been instituted as a policy for at least half that time. And yet it is only recently that these groups are seeking to end the policy. Indeed, older generations of Asian Americans students are more supportive of affirmative action than more recent generations. Thus the motivating factor for opposing affirmative action these days cannot merely be the recent immigrant's desire to find greater representation in the existing system, because that would have been the argument years ago. So what has changed? 

In East asian countries like Japan, China, and Korea, high school students take a college-entrance exam which largely is the sole factor in determining whether they go to college and what colleges they go to. Perhaps in these nations the historical evidence of the various ways their country intentionally siloed certain groups into lower or higher social categories is not so apparent that it is possible to believe that such tests are fair measures of aptitude or potential, and thus that the tests alone can function as a fair means to determine entry into universities.  As a consequence, maybe these recent immigrants carry ideals of meritocracy and fairness into America, a country which has never been very good at living up to these ideals. Affirmative action should be geared towards moving America closer to the meritocracy it claims by giving opportunities to groups who had been denied them in the past. But it is understandable for people who have recently come to this country, and maybe are less immersed in its history, to see affirmative action as antithetical to these goals. It must be understandable since it is well known that those who know more of American history, primarily because they and their forbears have been a part of shaping it, see it the same way. 

But Japanese colleges' focus on entrance exams existed at least since the country's occupation after WWII, China's national college entrance exam the Gaokao has existed since 1952, and a version of Korea's exam has existed since the 1960s. Moreover, affirmative action as it existed in the 1960s, just like affirmative action today, was never allowed to be geared towards righting historical wrongs, but rather towards the more palatable ends of promoting the historically less accountable goal of diversity. One could argue that this "diversity" goal was a dog-whistle for what some knew really meant "righting historical wrongs", and thus those who supported affirmative action and those who did not were morally tinged accordingly. But in the 1960s, a time when famous universities consisted mostly of white and jewish men, immigrant groups from non-European countries could align themselves with the supposedly more moral side of the diversity argument since this diversity goal led to their allowance into places very few of them had previously been. Further increasing the representation of Asian American immigrants was their status as minorities that white people had the least objection to, disconnected as they were from the limiting black-white lens through which the country interpreted many of its demographic problems. But now with Asian American students consisting of a much larger percentage of prestigious universities than their percentage in the population, the diversity goals of affirmative action are now detrimental to their further increased representation in these places, and there is more of an incentive to ignore the historical purpose of affirmative action using the same arguments many in this country have already used.

Now, we have to acknowledge that the average personality scores for Asian Americans in Harvard's internal ranking system are so statistically unlikely that we should reasonably conclude that the admissions committee was seeking post-hoc reasons to depress the number of Asian applicants, was defining these personality scores based on stereotypes surrounding the demographic identities of these applicant, or maybe even both. We should conclude this unless, of course, we are willing to accept that, for whatever reason, Asian Americans have worse (at least on Harvard's scale) personalities than other groups. Most egalitarians (and most people who support affirmative action) do not accept this, and thus the Harvard case may put them in a bind problematic. But what is perhaps ironic is that

Many liberals who support affirmative action do not accept this and thus the Harvard case puts them in a bind, trapped between both their political belief in affirmative action policies and their moral (if not practiced) claims toward anti-racism. But this bind does not exist for the plaintiffs, a fact which is revealing of the focus of their interest. Strangely, although people can immediately recognize that the evaluation of certain demographic groups as having worse personalities than others is "problematic" and indication of bias, many people are perfectly willing to accept as equitable and meritocratic a society in which certain demographic groups score, on average, standard deviations less than other groups in a scholastic aptitude test. The ability to clearly recognize problems in one and a largely somnolent acceptance of the other might have more to do with America's naive and ahistorical notions about meritocracy and objectivity than it does with the legacy of ideas about the intelligence of black and latino people, although in truth it is likely difficult to separate the two. Consequently, the case brought by the anonymous Asian American plaintiffs in the SFFA case feels ironic in a way deeper than the fact that a demographic minority (at least at the population level) is attempting to eliminate a policy that is supposed to help demographic minorities: The deeper irony is that this group is arguing the case based on a recognition of their discrimination in the local context of university admissions in the past decade, and in so doing is seeking to dismantle policies meant to repair the larger context of an America-wide discrimination over the course of its history.

People have suggested that the plaintiffs status as minorities in America indicate that they are being used unknowingly by more sinister conservative forces, but I think this is somewhat ungenerous, and that the plaintiffs indeed know what they are doing. If the plaintiffs were truly interested in improving university education's subscription to meritocracy, they would have chosen a different target for their efforts to reform admissions. This court case could have been about legacy admissions and elitism, about manufactured scarcity masquerading as quality, about the various ways the economically enfranchised have always used the markers of prestige to monitor and restrict access to their resources and capital. Instead it is about race and why race should not be relevant in considering such access. Maybe the plaintiffs do not seek a critique of prestige and access because what is sought is not a reconfiguring of the hierarchies of exclusivity and importance, but simply a change to the selective filter of who has access to it. The case is not the claim that "this system is broken," but rather that "more people like us should be allowed to be part of this system." In this way, perhaps the price of the ticket has not changed at all.

Loose Ends

"What they are seeking is not merely assimilation into American society but allowance into the ranks of the socioeconomically advantaged elite in that society. In this sense, maybe the ticket has changed and the price has not. The end goal is slightly different, making as it does fine distinctions in the class structure of American society, but to get there one still has to ignore the history of the country and develop a rather narrow sense of what constitutes justice and fairness. 

This brings us back to the price of the ticket and what has changed. There is still a repudiation of social infrastructure which could support the economically disenfranchised and this repudiation is still done in the name of achieving a good and profitable life in this country. But what is sought is not mere assimilation into American society but acceptance into the ranks of the socioeconomically advantaged in this society. The olde price was a gradual loss of ethnic identity and a gradual adjustment to America's black-white antithesis. The new price seems to be an opportunistic abandonment of ideas about fairness and justice now that the policies extending from those ideals seem disadvantageous.


There is still a repudiation of beliefs/ideas/systems which could support the economically disenfranchised and this repudiation is still done in the name of achieving a good and profitable life in this country. But what is sought is not mere assimilation into American society but acceptance into the ranks of the socioeconomically advantaged in this society. "

The price was previously a gradual loss of ethnic identity and a gradual adjustment to America's black-white antithesis. The new price seems to be an opportunistic abandonment of the ethical ideals motivating a policy which only now proves disadvantageous.

This brings us back to the price of the ticket and what has changed. For one, the ticket has changed. What is sought is not mere assimilation into American society but allowance into the ranks of those who have the social connections and resources to become the architects or at least the maintainers of that society. And the price seems has changed too because although the national identity of these immigrants is being obscured by the term "Asian Americans" what is actually being relinquished is not their avowed subscription to justice and fairness.



(immigrant's experience with a test-taking or grade defined meritocracy is not recent)

 and the reasons for why affirmative action have been so bastardized that its moral purpose connected to history can be safely ignored. 


so the motivating factor cannot merely be an attempt to more closely align with the dominant/prominant/white idea that affirmative action is anti-meritocratic. because that would have always historically been the case. 

But affirmative action (really only existed i

Of course an American would see the court cases of immigrants throughout this country concerning various ways their particular immigrant group is being discriminated against as part of the same narrative of identity alignment with power or distancing from the disempowered. But immigrants from East Asia have been coming to this country for much of the 20th century and affirmative action has been instituted as a policy for at least half that amount of time. Older immigrants, those who have assimilated long ago, seem to be fine with affirmative action and agree with its policies. Yet, if Michael Wang is representative of the plaintiffs or in general those with grievances against affirmative action, it appears that it is zeroth generation immigrants and their children (i.e., the least assimilated) who are giving the most vocal opposition to the race-based policy. Namely it is the least assimilated Asian immigrants are are seemingly aligning as closely as possible with this limited version of meritocratic ideals espoused by some people in this country. This suggests that the idea that these immigrants are paying the standard "price" for acceptance into American culture is the wrong lens. 

and thus they only happen to coincide with the conservative/white ideal of meritocracy. 

simply because their lineage extends many generations into the past), see it the same way. 

(Alternative to the idea that these Asian Americans are trying to assimilate)
- Asian Americans have been immigrating to the U.S. since the 1960s, but an additional paradox of the case is that those who are suing Harvard are the assimilated of the country's Asian Americans. Namely they are the most recent immigrants to this country who are seemingly attempting to align as closely as possible with the meritocratic ideals espoused by the country's more powerful groups. This fact suggests this assimilation perspective is perhaps the wrong lens. Rather these recent immigrants, as recent immigrants, are coming from cultures in which test taking as a means of placement was the norm. In these cultures, perhaps the historical demographic stratification of their society's was not so obvious that they could believe the tests were fair measures of ability/aptititude/potential and thus well functioned as a means to determine entry into universities. Thus these asian americans coming to this country carry with them these ideals of meritocracy and fairness into a country which has never been very good at holding up to these ideals. Affirmative action was meant to actually move America closer to a meritocracy, but people who have recently come to this country or those who have not studied its history could perhaps see it as antithetical to these goals. This is perhaps understandable.

- By framing the limitations in college admissions as one due to race and affirmative action, they are choosing a particular frame in which to consider the problems of affirmative action. 

- The court case should be about elitism, about manufactured scarcity masquerading as quality and importance and about the various ways the economically enfranchised have used the markers of prestige to monitor and restrict group acceptance.

- The court case should concern a critique of the prestige which these days amounts to manufactured scarcity masquerading as distinctive quality. A cynical possibility is that there is no desired critique of prestige because what is sought is not a destruction of the hierarchical structures of exclusivity and importance but a reconfiguring of the barriers which allow/afford entrance. Rather than critiquing power there seeks a more profound policing of who has access to it.

+++++

What is ironic/different is that the plaintiffs are choosing the side of the existing system/cultural norm while simultaneously emphasizing the identities foisted upon them. 

What is strange and different is that the plaintiffs appear to be having it both ways. Supporting an ideology of the dominant while professing an identity of the marginalized. 

There is a phrase that my high school Chinese-American friends used to describe their more clearly immigrant counterparts. "FOB" meaning "Fresh-of-the-Boat" meaning that the people who earned this moniker stood out from other better assimilated Americans through their inability to completely shed the vestiges of their original culture and nation. Of course the phrase has the bearing of a joke which on the surface is made in jest, but actually reveals a truth both the teller and receiver recognizes. It references a divide felt in all cultures between those who have "made it" to some new destination and those who are still in their homeland, and the recognition that to make it here one must accept certain things, and be a certain way. This idea is not entirely new. Years ago, Baldwin spoke of the price of the ticket that people paid when coming to America. At the time America was—is(?), will forever be(?)—caught in the throes of the "Negro problem" and as it was working through this solution it had to be clear that newcomers were on the same page. They were coming to this country and they had to accept things the way they were. So the price of the ticket to come to this country was to insert oneself into the strata of identity and humanity and maintain it until the "Negro Problem" was resolved. This meant that Italians, Irish, Polish, and Germans, entered America and then became white. Therefore, the term "price of the ticket" applied to European Americans making the trek to the Northeast. But let's be  be cosmopolitan and assert that the price of the ticket has not changed all these years and applies as well to those making the trip across the Pacific. 

It seems strange that the group is trying to have it both ways. Support an ideology of the dominant by professing the identity of the marginalized. I am curious as to how this will turn out. Curious still as to whether the price of the ticket can ever not be paid in full.

You can't make this stuff up - Exercise 1
Sketch of experiences (your own or others) vividly remembered 
— The "rivering" of the brothers of Nu Delta
— Returning to Ben Franklin after four years away
— Traveling to William and Mary or to Dorfgastein Austria or to Geneva Switzerland

I waited in the house foyer. It was the natural place for things like this to start. The foyer acted as sort of the heart of the house connecting anyone inside to the pool room, the main stairs, the dining room, the back stairs, and the kitchen. In the middle of the foyer were two steps and a short banister behind which I stood. Two floors up into the entrails of the house in a double-room looking out onto the parking lot was a red and royal purple jersey with the letters NΔ on the front and my first name on the back. Tonight would have been a good night to wear it, but the colors were too loud, and tonight was not a night to draw attention to ourselves. 

At the beginning I stood alone, but soon brothers came from their rooms or from outside. They were loose and easy when they came in, bullshiting and shade-delivering. The prospects of the night seemed to have wound them up like wildlife before a storm [BAD SIMILE]. I stood away from them. I couldn't be loose. I couldn't be easy. Not yet anyway, not for a few months. 

Eventually a few of the pledges came in. I nodded to them in turn, and continued to wait. When it was 7pm, not all the pledges had arrived, and thus came the first decision. This was the first night all the brothers and pledges would be gathered for a house activity, and yet the main players were late. I knew from my own experience two years prior how quickly mistakes became habits, excuses turned into reasons, slips and trips became part of a gait. Expectations needed to be communicated and if I managed to do so correctly, the subtext would be the more important notion that this house was not an entirely safe space, that failure was possible, that failure had consequences which affected their potential position in this new community. Of course, this was false. The pledges place in this new community was largely assured on the night they pledged to the fraternity. But to get them to the end I knew I had to tell them many lies in order to get them to commit to work which would allow them to see deeper truth hidden beneath the lies.

I struck the miniature gong in the center of the room a dozen times,bringing the foyer to complete science. "Pledges," I said almost spitting the word. "You were late." I turned, clasping my hands behind my back and took a few steps along the raised foyer area. Suddenly I lost track of what I was going to say. "Today was your first event, and you were not on time" I said repeating myself. The brothers looked to me in silence and all of a sudden I felt exposed. Would it be too much to punish the pledges immediately? Maybe. Perhaps a middle road could work. I stopped and looked at the room. "Let tonight be your first and only warning. Do not be late again" The tension eased. I looked away from the pledges and toward the brothers. "Let's roll out!" I shouted and stepped down the stairs to the the entrance and out into the cold fall night.

Weekly Review
I didn't do a review last week so I need to cover about two weeks of work. There are three major developments. 

First, I finished applying to all the fellowships I wanted except for the Stanford fellowship and the UC presidential scholar fellowship. In particular I managed to write a statement of interest for the Santa Fe Institute Fellowship and a (likely unnecessary) cover letter for Yale's Mossman fellowship. Quite strange that I am looking back on all this work now. I remember in the week these fellowships were due, I had no desire to do anything. I can't even remember the exact day of the week when I decided to get out of bed and try to commit myself to an honest day's work. 

Second, I have made some significant changes in the "Self-Assembly of a Dimer System" work.  I recently realized is that my calculations of Tk and Tm are inconsistent. To calculate Tk, I set <k> = <m> = N-1 and in my text I claimed to do the same thing for the calculation of Tm. However, looking at the equilibrium condition for <m> one can show that <k>=<m>=N-1 is an impossible condition to satisfy. It is possible to derive the stated Tm if one sets <m> = <k> = N, but then the <k>=N condition results in a divergence in the equilibrium condition for <k>. Therefore, the current document (dimer_system_draft_4th) calculates and interprets the critical temperatures Tk and Tm incorrectly and thus also incorrectly characterizes Type I and Type II systems. At first, the fact of the logical inconsistencies in the definitions of Tk and Tm confused me, partly because the numerical results showed that Tk and Tm did accurately define the "fully-correct dimerization" phase for some systems. So I had happened to find the correct answer (or something close to it) through incorrect reasoning. In a way, I have been banging my head against this particular point since January when I derived an initial version of these equilibrium conditions by performing a free energy expansion of the series form of the partition function. Even though these conditions didn't allow for <k> = <m> not to mention <k> = N, I was luckily able to hack together an argument and derive Tk and Tm from that version of these conditions. It was only later when I obtained the correct conditions through the more rigorous form of Laplace's method, that I returned to this question of how to derive Tk and Tm. I asked this question of myself back in May and I obtained the answer written up in the current document, until I realized last week that it was wrong. 

I chose the condition  <k>=<m> = N-1, rather than the condition <k>= <m>=N, because I was trying to avoid the divergence in the equilibrium equation for <k>. However, my main stumbling block was failing to realize that the equilibrium conditions do not admit a solution to <k>=<m> = N-1. Instead, the correct condition defining the "fully-correct dimerization phase" is simply <k> = <m>. Imposing this condition, one can derive the temperature Tc at which it is satisfied. Also, one finds that for physics values of Tc, the value of <m> (and in turn <k>) is less than N but greater than N-1/2, and thus the system is indeed in a fully-correct dimerization phase. Finally, in the E0-> Infinity limit one finds that Tc -> Tm, and in the Del->Infinity limit one find  Tc ->Tk, as I observed in the numerical simulations and solutions to the equilibrium equations. 

Because of these corrections, I'm completely rewriting the discussions on the fully correct dimerization phase and Type I-II systems. Also, I am removing the current E0-Del and 2N-lam^3/V phase diagrams from the paper. The only clearly discernible "phase" of the system is the one of "fully-correct dimerization"; all other apparent phases are not quantitative demarcated from one another and thus would be more appropriately defined as regimes of behavior. Therefore, representing them in a phase diagram with straight lines is potentially confusing, making the phases seem more distinct than they are. Moreover, from my new analysis of the "fully correct dimerization" phase,  I have realized that my regime categorizations are not accurate. There are parts of the "completely dimerized and fully correct" space of the diagram which do not correspond to complete dimerization or full correctness. Same thing goes for the "completely dimerized and partially correct" space. Also, it is misleading to characterize one of the Type II regimes as "completely dimerized and partially correct" since said regime consists mostly of incorrect dimers. 

Instead of this phase diagram I am going to present three contour plots and from these plots, I'll abstract a way a diagram describing the regimes of <k> and <m> behavior of the system and emphasize that all of these regimes (except for the "fully-correct dimerization" regime) are defined based on qualitative features and not based on any analytical properties of the free energy or the equilibrium conditions. 

The final major development concerns my writing. 

I am trying to cultivate a new habit of long-form writing, one which could lead me to publishing my writings in a magazine or online somewhere. I have always found such writing quite difficult. When writing up the results of a physics project, one's content is given precedence over one's language. Of course the language should strive to be clear and coherent, but since the main thrust of the project exists in its results, there are many ways to write up the work so that it satisfies the properties of a solid, comprehensible, and extendable piece of science. The objective in writing such science is logical clarity and a conveyance of understanding, and when one has accumulated enough results, one mostly just needs time and patience to ensure that they are written up well. 

When writing outside of academia, there is less of a clear distinction between the form/style of a piece and the main message it is trying to convey. For memoirs and narrative nonfiction pieces the language and the content cannot be so easily separated because the way what you're narrating hits the reader is inevitably influenced (if not outright determined) by how you describe it. Style affects substance. 

One other difference is that for theoretical physics work, one can separate the tinkering and searching process from the writing process. Playing around with equations on a blank page doesn't induce the same level of fear or anxiety as does composing sentences on a blank screen since the former feels like such a low-stakes activity. You know that what you're writing is by nature preliminary so you don't feel like the first thing you write has to be perfect. So the sequential process of idea exploration and then idea transcription can be distinct in physics because the two activities simply look quite different.  But in writing, one's written exploration of a new idea looks a lot like one's written transcription of a finalized one, so it's possible to confuse the stage you're in and hold your work to a standard higher than one it is ready for. 

Making matters worse is that the way that I free write (which is what I am doing now) is not really the best way to write polished essays. Instead it is perhaps the best way to explore the surface of an initial idea before a focus is developed, the idea is further fleshed out, and then finally made part of a larger cohesive story. So the habits developed through daily writing could actually be impeding my ability to apply those habits to longer projects. 

With the recognition that the style of my writing partly dictates the message, the common mischaracterization of an initial draft as a final draft, and a habit of writing without editing or polishing, it is not surprising that I am finding it difficult to write long-form pieces. But since I have diagnosed some of the problem I can now take more well-directed steps to correct the issue. I remember doing something similar when I was first learning how to "do" physics investigations. One difference is that, unlike for theoretical physics, there are many guides with give advice and exercises for structuring long writing projects. The fact that I managed to figure out how to develop and pursue physics problems in the absence of such guides, gives me hope that I should find an easier time of learning to write essays given all the literature on the subject. 

There are some takeaways from this list of problems: 
Separate idea exploration from idea finalization: For your physics projects you sort of have three levels of problem investigation. The lowest level is everything that goes into your written notebook. You use this notebook to jot down ideas and to explore them in a low-stakes way. If you find a good problem or a good idea, you move on to the second level in which you add the problem/idea to your personal problems notebook or you give it its own document. These first two levels is where most of you ideas stay. However, if you find some way to frame the problem as part of a larger one, then you write a paper on it and you try to publish it and it thus reaches the third level.   I think your writing can be structured in a similar way. The journal doc can be a repository of where you explore ideas without any sense of commitment that these ideas need to be published some day. If you find an idea sufficiently compelling and you have managed to write it well enough, you can transfer it to its own document or add it to an essay collection (this would require you to create a new document). From this personal essay/writing collection, you can select some work for further modification/editing and eventual publishing.   The main purpose of breaking your writing into three levels (idea exploration, idea selection and specification, idea editing and preparation) like this is to take off the unnecessary pressure involved with the initial stage of the writing process. 

Substance before style: When exploring an idea, first try to flesh out the substance of the idea before you try to sculpt the style to fit the substance. It's difficult to focus on both at the same time, and although the syntax, diction, and all the other technical features associated with style affect a reader's response to your work, these features are wielded in support of substance. So make the substance concrete to yourself, and then work on ways of changing the style so that it better represents the message or purpose of your writing.   
Polishing/editing after free writing: Most of your writing in the Journal doc consists of free writing. Being able to do such writing is important because getting an idea on the page often exists as the first step in the writing process, but being able to edit an idea and make it better than it's initial presentation is what makes the work publishable. A way to practice such polishing and editing is to do it after each of you free writing efforts.

The personal experience of stereotype is to feel as though one stands in for a populace much larger than oneself. Your thoughts become their thoughts. Your weakness, their weakness. Your prejudices, their prejudices. And of course the transfer works in the opposite direction with the features of the populace flowing back onto you, seemingly substituting what is personal in yourself with what is shared by the larger group of people who look like you. You don't really have any choice in this. No matter how you are, to some people, what you are obscures all else and, as a result, you are painted as merely one of a much more general kind. Or, I suppose you have some choices. You could try to fight against the constant attempt to stereotype you, or you can leave, conveying disapproval by the simple refusal to participate in the dance of verifying or countering the ways other people see you. But then again, the ability to do either is predicated on the fact that you were allowed to even enter in the first place, a fact which is not at all guaranteed if it was others' very sense of the stereotype which served as a barrier to entry. 

When one thinks of stereotyping and university admissions, one's thoughts might float towards the few black faces on college websites and promotional photos, but it would be a mistake to limit the term in this way. The current court case between the SFFA and Harvard University shows this with Asian American students posited as the main victims of the university's slide toward tokenism. These students have been tokenized as

This choice seems to be a strategic one, with the Asian American plaintiffs behind SFFA deciding who their enemies are and who their friends are and acting accordingly. 
It appears that this of plaintiffs is making a choice many minority groups in America have made in the past, trading one thing for another in an attempt to become part of America, and gain the benefits of American citizenship 

sought to limit 

It is the common dilemma of many people in this country. You find that people see not you but the stereotype created around you, and even your deviations from the stereotype are folded back into it in a neat package which maintains the way the viewer sees the world. 

In ways similar to how black students and latino students have been painted as problematic minorities, Asian American students have been p

 black people on our college campus's, but it would be a mistake to limit the term in this way. The court case is at the surface one of tokenism. 


Chinese Americans were OK with tokenism as long as it painted them as minorities that white people din't have any problems with. The advantage was that they received the benefits of diversity and inclusion initiatives which might otherwise have gone to more historically disenfranchised groups. But now that this model minority status appears to be limiting their college prospects, or at least limiting them more than they would like, they want to relinquish the status and are at last willing to recognize it as the strait jacket it always was. The unfortunate thing is that their chosen approach to this relinquishing involves critiquing the social program which previously advantaged them, but which they now see as a threat since it seems to be advantaging others. But consistent throughout this flip is the desire to align themselves with the markers of economic achievement. 

Affirmative action policies were reinterpreted from efforts to ameliorate the consequences of historical injustice to the much softer issue of desiring to achieve diversity. Consequently, groups of people whose educational prospects were not artificially limited by U.S. social policy were grouped in as beneficiaries of affirmative action programs and thus reaped the benefits perhaps meant for other people. I know this because I am one of such people. Recent African immigrants or their children come from different social and cultural contexts than African Americans, and although they face much of the same optics-dependent prejudice of all people of color, they and their forbears have not had to experience the concerted effort of America over centuries to deny them the opportunities and access, and yet they still receive the benefits of affirmative action.

Is this because current generations do not want to take on the responsibility of injustices promulgated by their forefathers, perhaps do not even want to contemplate it? 

One should recognize that if the Blum gets his wish colleges would look more like Caltech than like more…of the demographic population. 



Looking through college brochures and advertisements one's sense of tokenism is exacerbated. Mostly what one sees are white un-intimidating faces peering back upon one, or students gathered in some mock up of a sharing circle where mostly white faces are present with a spattering of some other races. The optics as always are important here. It would look strange if each person in the figure looked too demographically similar to all other people. People would begin wondering why that was and perhaps begin looking for motives to suggest that it was not a coincidence. Too many white people and the school seems like a caricature of elitism of social inequality. Put too many black people and your college might be mistaken for a HBCU. Too many Asian Americans and your school might be considered too technical and drive away all the softer liberal arts majors. 

The essence of 

——

When you walk through the "BF" aisle in a library, you see all the books on the psychology of intelligence. In my first year in college I spent a lot of time in this section. Many nights, when I finished my assignments in differential equations or electromagnetism, I would walk beyond the shelves with their mathematics and physics texts and up the stairs to the humanities and social sciences level of the library. There I'd look through texts on genius, creativity, intellectual ability and all the chosen and unchosen life elements that contributed to these factors. 

If you had asked me at the time why I was so interested in these topics, I don't think I would have been able to tell you. In retrospect, I think I was trying to find the general features of work common to all fields which lead people to do good work. I was a new student, just beginning to make the fitful steps into a new career, and I wanted to see what general habits of thinking and work I would need to cultivate in order to be successful. In these psychology stacks, I read books by Howard Gardner and learned of his notion of multiple intelligences. I also read books by Dean Simonton where he argued that eminent scientists had so many things named after them not because they produced a greater proportion of high quality work than their contemporaries, but because they produced more work. In a sense their quality-quantity ratio was the same; their denominator was just bigger because they worked that much harder. 

If one spends enough time just reading through works on intelligence and genius, it doesn't take too long to find work discussing race, gender, and intelligence. It was during this phase of reading material that I first discovered Murray and Hernstein's The Bell Curve. Or rather I first discovered criticisms concerning The Bell Curve, and later discovered the book itself. There is a stereotype about physicists that we oversimplify things, that we are interested in reducing a system down to some small collection of fundamental principles from which we hope to encapsulate the entire understanding of the system if not the world itself. At the time of these perusals, I had yet to become a physicist, but I was still drawn to such ways of thinking. This is to say that the premise of The Bell Curve was really attractive to me. A way to explain social stratification through the population-wide distribution of a certain number? So simple! So seemingly all encompassing! And of course many of statistical conclusions of the book made sense. Of course, if intelligence was defined as an analytical ability to successfully engage with and solve problems in the world, and of course if that intelligence could be measured with a test, then those who had higher scores on that test would fare better in a world in which one's socioeconomic status was dependent on how well one navigated problems. Even the book's statements about race and intelligence made sense to me. So when I read through Part III of the book where the authors present the IQ distributions of white and black people, and I saw the distribution for black people had a lower average than that for white people, I was neither surprises nor troubled. I knew enough about SAT score statistics and retention rates to have been able to guess what these distributions would look like ever before I saw them. But I didn't view these results as existentially significant as the authors did. For some reason, I didn'

Part of me saw these lower IQ scores as something existentially significant, as something true to black people, but another part of me saw it more as saying something fundamental about the educational resources black people have had access to. Because I was of course a black student at MIT and I was doing just fine here. Then again, the nature of exceptions is that they disprove hard rules rather than statistical ones, and the substance of the Bell Curve's arguments was that one could look at counter examples as outliers. And again, as the authors adamantly claim, the arguments in the book apply to averages of the population; These results supposedly say nothing at all about individuals. 

[What's next…?] Still I was one of the few people black people at MIT. I worked alone, throughout most of my time there. I cannot say that this was the result of any sort of racism. Rather it was the result of arrogance. I didn't think anyone wouldbe able to show me how to solve a problem I didn't know how to solve and if they were to show it to me my learning would have been less than if I were to struggle through it, if at all unsuccessfully myself. So at MIT I worked so hard that I had not time to pay attention to the demographics of my position. But much of this work was built upon habits that were themselves a response to a similarity between my situation and Vincent's in Gattaca. I knew on some level that I was part of a caste system, that people would inspect me in some way and prematurely deign me to be wanting, and that even if I did not see myself as inferior others would and this assumption would color all evaluations of my accomplishments. If I ever wanted to achieve something I had to work harder and better and faster than anyone else. This is what led me to study physics on my own. And to teach myself calculus. And to eventually attend MITES where I watched that movie which put all this work into focus and explained to me why I was doing it beter than I could have ever explained it to myself. In this instance someone, or rather something else, had given me an answer and I could not tell whether or not I was better or worse off for having ntot found it myself. 

[Connection] 
Library, Intelligence and my own insecurity, I was not surprised by Murray's argument because on some level I had always believed it, and yet I had always believed that my hard work could make up for it. My sister, my mother, and my father all served as counter examples, Ralph Ellison, Toni Morrison, Frederick Douglas, too and I still believed that The Bell Curve's conclusiosn were true. 

Why did I believe this? When did these beliefs start? hey were not really communicated to me by my parents. Rather they were communicated to me by the optics of the classrooms I occupied. 











One section, in the book presents bell curves of different races, and shows that black people have IQ distributions to the left, that is with a lower average IQ than the distributions for other populations. 

I have to admit to not being immediately offended by this graph. I knew enough about SAT score statistics and retention rates to extrapolate the general academic preparedness of black people in America. But I didn't view these results as existentially as the authors suggested. For some reason, I didn't see this lower average IQ as saying something fundamental about black people. Rather I saw it as saying something fundamental about the educational resources they had access to. Because, of course, here I was a black student at MIT. An exception might disprove a rule, but the nature of The Bell Curve's arguments is that one could look at counter examples as statistical fluctuations. Of course there would be someone who slips through! There always is! Also, the arguments apply to the average of the population; it supposedly says nothing about individuals. 

Nevertheless one of the author's conclusions about these IQ distributions is that we should rethink social policy. For example, if the populace of black people is indeed less intelligent than the populace of damn near everyone, then aren't we wasting welfare on people who are poor because of their low intelligence? And if this low intelligence is indeed a fact, what are we doing populating academically intensive schools with students who by their very race and the associated intellectual spectrum they likely—only likely!—occupy cannot make best use of these resources?

As far as arguments against affirmative action go, Murray and Hernstein are not original. Rather they provided some statistical backing for what people have believed since affirmative action policies were put in place, and even further back to the start of the U.S. Giving resources to black people takes resources away from non-black people, and black people don't even make good use of these resources anyway because their cerebral capacity is insufficient for them to do so. These days no one makes such explicit of arguments concerning affirmative action, rather the argument has been reincarnated in a new theory which purports the same thing. Mismatch theory claims that affirmative action leads to black students choosing schools which are not a good "fit" for them, thus leading to their demoralization and ultimately more harm than if they attended a more appropriate school.

Of course these arguments seem more concerned with watching racial boundaries and ensuring that people you think are not deserving do not get what you think they don't deserve. That is perhaps what was laughably transparent about Fisher's case two years ago. Why would a student with slightly above average grades feel entitled to a spot in a university simply because she thinks she deserves it more than black or hispanic students with worse grades? The only way race could be the determining factor in such a case, is if there were no white students with worse grades than Fisher who were accepted. If there were such students then her singling out of Black students would be revealed as the racial ploy it was.

A new case is in the headlines these days concerning affirmative action. Asian American students are suing Harvard university for discrimination. Interesting the argument is not that these powerful institutions are discriminating against Asian Americans in preference of underrepresented minorities, but rather that they are discriminating in preference of white applicants. As far as argumentative ploys go, it is a rather genius one if at all transparent. It's quite clear what effect the ruling would have on the percentage of white applicants and the percentage of black applicants in universities. The individuals legislating this case are not known to the public, but there are some Asian American students who have been willingly to come forward with their view on the matter. It is worth noting that these students are mostly Chinese.

The court case should concern a critique of the prestige which these days amounts to manufactured scarcity masquerading as distinctive quality. A cynical possibility is that there is no desired critique of prestige because what is sought is not a destruction of the hierarchical structures of exclusivity and importance but a reconfiguring of the barriers which allow/afford entrance. Rather than critiquing power there seeks a more profound policing of who has access to it.

News of the Future
Yesterday I learned that I didn't make it to the next round of interviews for the Pappalardo fellowship. It seems then that no matter what comes, next year I will not be living in Boston or I will not be in academia. Am I disappointed by this rejection? Unquestionably. But I can't parse the real source of this feeling, or what I should take the rejection to mean. Was it communicated to me that I am not as good a physicist as I think I am? Or can I interpret the rejection in the most self-interested way possible, as a failure of the search committee to recognize my latent greatness? Of course whatever interpretation I choose would just reveal my own insecurities. Let's count them: I have only published two physics papers. I spent a large portion of my time teaching rather than doing research. I made a typo in the first sentence of my submitted research statement. I haven't published any papers with my advisor. I haven't received any fellowships for my work. 

I don't know. I have went through this process somewhat arrogantly only applying to prestigious research fellowships. I pursued these fellowships because they were independent ones and I didn't want to pretend to be interested in working under a particular professor. Even now that I'm "working under" Eugene, I seem to be simply working adjacent to him, with the space defining that adjacency growing by the week. Now, he hardly even bothers to respond to my emails. 

I need to think seriously about what I will do if I don't receive any fellowships. Will I select a short-term teaching position? Or will I leave physics and academia for some job in a non-profit organization/private sector? 
In an effort to make some concrete plans I can apply to the Insight Data Fellows program, which has an application deadline of February 11, 2019. 

I can also apply to more post-doctoral fellowships. There is a Kadanoff fellowship at University of Chicago but the application is due tomorrow and it seems the committee is looking for people who work on hard condensed matter.

Lessons from Writing "Fresh Off the Boat": Cornerstones, Content, and Continuity
I think I managed to write a good first draft of a new essay. The essay was supposed to be part of a much longer piece on affirmative action, race and IQ, history, and my own personal understanding of intelligence, but I was not able to incorporate all of these elements into a cohesive story. So instead I focused on Asian Americans, Baldwin's concept of the price of the ticket, and affirmative action. The essay began as a long paragraph about the term "Fresh off the boat" and Baldwin's concept of the "Price of the ticket" and while I was editing this paragraph I found ways to extend it by considering more topical questions like the SFFA's current case against Harvard University, a case which although is lead by attorney Edward Blum has a group of Asian Americans as the plaintiffs. 

Some lessons from this writing experience. 

I have been trying to find analogies between the process of writing an essay and the process of writing up a physics investigation. I recently concluded that doing the latter is easier because once one has solved a concrete problem, one already has sufficient content to begin considering how to shape it into a discussion explaining the content, while for essays the content and the style of the work sometimes need to be shaped together. Thus, I saw the two processes as distinct. However, the experience of writing this most recent essay (and reflecting on my previous essays), I realize that writing an essay and writing up a physics investigation are similar in that if you manage to complete a particularly important aspect of the larger work, you can then proceed with more confidence that the longer work will follow as a matter of course. Namely, if you manage to go through the difficult work of building the "cornerstone" for either type of project, then you are given a foundation on which to build the more peripheral aspects and these peripheral aspects follow more easily. For physics, two of the common corner stones I use are a concrete question embedded in some physical framework or a set of premises/assumptions that are explored in the body of the work. For this essay, the corner stone was the paragraph on the term "FOB" and how the term relates partly to the process through which Asian Americans are assimilated into this country. Considering some other essays, like "Only one who speaks" and "Identity on the periphery" I can recognize that the cornerstones are certain paragraphs. The essay builds towards these paragraphs because these paragraphs represent the most fundamental insights of the piece. 

So one lesson is to try to explore possible cornerstones of the essay, and then when you have a good one, build context and explanation to flesh it out. 

The two other lessons are really just descriptions of elements that I think are important for an essay: content and continuity. On the one hand, an essay obviously requires content in that it needs to explore a problem, idea, or a story. On the other hand, the essay also needs to be logically or at least narratively continuous rather than a collection of ideas. That is one problem that I had when trying to write the longer essay on affirmative action, race and IQ, history, etc. I had a lot of ideas (i.e., a lot of content), but it wasn't clear to me how to flesh out the ideas while making it clear that their connections were not arbitrary or enforced. Maybe this is because I'm not a good enough writer, or maybe because the connection I perceive in these ideas is that they are all related to my own personal insecurity and thus they have no real relation to one another outside my own experience. I personally think it is the former is the source of my difficulties in writing this essay.

What Does It Take to Be Successful
I just read a really interesting paper in the sociology of science. The author of the paper asked about 60 physicists "What do you think are the most important qualities needed to be successful at the type of work you do?" The most common answer (given by 31 out of 60 of the physicists) was "persistence." Following persistence was "intelligence" (15 out of 60), "civility" (14 out of 60), and then creativity (12 out of 60). I think this result is interesting because it echoes something I've heard from writers before: Persistence is the most important quality when seeking to become a writer. I think Baldwin said it in one of his interviews (in "Conversations with James Baldwin"), and I remember reading a longish piece by another writer where persistence was the omnipresent motif. It is interesting that with the culture's conception of physicists as decidedly intelligent most of them city another quality when stating what they think has made them successful. Here is a quote from the piece:

"I think [the qualities for success] are the same in sociology as they are in physics. That is, a lot of drive. A sense that you want to accomplish something and a willingness to constantly work hard at it, because I think the most important thing for success is not just the creativity one has, although that's important. But probably more important than creativity is the consistency of effort, the effort is what in the end makes a dramatic difference. I've seen too many people who are very creative, who do an occasional very good piece of work, be it in applied research or in technology or in fundamental physics, but they don't carry it through … And when there is a set back, take it too personally. There are always setbacks.

The Matthew Effect in Science
The Matthew Effect is what Robert K. Merton calls the tendency for financial resources and rewards (both concrete and informal) to accrue to those who already have a great amount of both. It is termed as such due to the parable of the talents in the New Testament book of Matthews:

"For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have in abundance: but from hi that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath."

A rather dire statement concerning how the current distribution of resources affects future distribution of resources. Merton uses the idea as a way to frame how scientific communities evaluate and reward the work of their members. He considers many situations: A paper with multiple authors is often attributed to the most famous author regardless of his or her order in the author list. Two similar papers written by two different authors will lead to the more famous author being attributed as having obtained the result, even if he or she derived much of the the work from the paper of the lesser known author. Scientists who already have many awards are often given even more awards. Papers by anonymous authors are less often read than papers by their more famous counterparts, leading the latter to earn more citations and become even more famous. There is also a modern version of the Matthew Effect which Merton does not mention because the funding structure of science was different in 1968: Research grants tend to be awarded to people who have previously obtained such grants. 

Therefore, according to the Matthew Effect, I am in a bind with my own work. It might be true that I conceived of and completed it alone, but if I publish it alone it will not be read, while if I publish it with Eugene then the work would be falsely attributed to him. On some level I have always known this, and I have already made my decision about which I would prefer, but it is nice to read the explicit consequences of either choices in a text.

One interesting point about awards is that they can be interpreted as a two-way correspondence between awarding agency and awardee. In some cases the given award bestows the scientist with increased value, but for other cases it is the other way around, and, in fact, if the award is not given to said scientist it may lose some of its supposed value. For example, the Nobel Prize is the most prestigious prize in many academic fields. In fields whose practitioners are relatively unknown outside their discipline, if not merely outside their sub-discipline, the Nobel Prize functions to give these scientists greater recognition and a historical stamp of approval. But if a scientist is already well-known for his or her work, then the stamp of approval works in the other direction, showing that the awarding agency, even if belated in their judgments, are capable judgers of quality. Thus, in the early 20th century, if the Nobel prize were to continue to exist as the standard bearer for scientific quality, the Nobel committee had to eventually give Einstein the Nobel Prize for something even if that something was not his most revolutionary works. Similarly, the fact that the Nobel Prize was not given to Rosalind Franklin and Lise Meitner are marks against it and reasons enough for scientists to believe it is not the sole arbiter of who has made a lasting contribution in science. 

"Occupants of the Forty-First Chair" is what Merton terms people who were not given (but surely deserved) awards and positions due to the limited availability of either. I wonder what he would term people who were not given these things because their surrounding scientific community did not recognize them as deserving them.

Interestingly, as well is the way the Matthew Effect can work retrospectively. If a scientist only becomes famous later on in her career then her earlier papers are reinterpreted according to the effect. For example, in such late-onset-fame an earlier collaborative paper between the famous author and another author would then be attributed to the now more famous author even at the time the other author (because he or she was her advisor) was more well-known. 

This example suggests that the Matthew Effect cannot be a hard rule in evaluating scientific work. No famous scientist is born famous so it cannot be entirely true that only the work of well-known scientists is read, cited, and awarded. Rather there must be a liminal space in which the community violates the Matthew Effect in how it gives rewards or how it cites papers so that scientist who are not well-known eventually accumulate enough "recognition momentum" to transition into becoming more well-known. So, there is an argument to be made about focusing on doing quality work rather than trying to engineer the peripheral conditions of you work—like what journal you're publishing in or who your coauthors are—to maximize its impact according to the sociological structures of science.

Are the results of science inevitable?
That's the question Ian Hacking asks in his articles "How inevitable are the results of successful science?" As a piece of scientific research the article is really interesting because it does raise and investigate interesting questions (a major goal of a research article) but it is written in a very non-academic style sort of like an extended free-writing exercise or a brain dump. This is not to say that the paper has no structure, but that the structure is marginal; there are no section titles and the work is more organized around of a successive refinement and analysis of the question in the title. The paper is more of an opinion essay, but since I do like opinion essays I also like the paper. 

The first refinement of this question comes from first acknowledging the fact that many of the technological and industrial results of science are not at all inevitable, things such as the elimination of small pox, the information revolution, or the existence of fertilizers and pesticides. Instead he phrases the central question as a conditional one:

"…if we were to be successful in a science, such as cosmology or cell biology, with something like our current interests, would we have to arrive at or pass through something roughly equivalent to our present cosmology or cell biology?"

His example followed an immunology question initially posed by Medawar in 1953: why do mothers not reject their fetuses which are 50% foreign? Hacking then cites a research team which in 1998 found the enzyme indoleamine 2.3-dioxygenase (IDO) which was found to destroy the enzyme tryptophan which itself turned on the T-cells that worked to reject foreign bodies in an organism. Could it be that a larger quantity of IDO was the reason mothers could take their fetuses to term, and conversely that an insufficient quantity was the reason for miscarriages? Regardless, Hacking considers the discovery as an example of successful science in the sense that something new was discovered and this thing was accepted by the scientific community. He then asks whether it is possible to conceive of a version of 20th century immunology which had not found this enzyme but which was considered just as successful as our own historical version of immunology. He thinks it is very possible to conceive of such a thing but then he contradicts himself. He claims that the IDO result is not inevitable, but then a few sentences later claims that his explanation does not imply that the discovery about IDO was not inevitable.

That is first he says 

"It is easy to imagine that immunology could have done an 'end run' around this little bit of successful immunology,…That seems to me to be perfectly conceivable. In this sense, the result…does not appear to be an inevitable result, essential to any immunology as successful as present immunology, simply because we might, so far as I can tell, simply have bypassed it."

But then he says 

"Notice first that the 'end run' story (or fantasy) does not really imply that a certain result of successful science, the discovery about IDO, was not inevitable. This is because it will be protested that our present immunology, if correct, ought to be 'contained' in the end run story."

 Clarifying the apparent contradiction is perhaps what he means when he refers to "IDO" and "discovery about IDO" and "story". I think he is claiming that it was possible to, by 1998, develop a version of immunology which had not yet discovered IDO but which was entirely consistent with the circa 1998 results concerning immunology. In this sense IDO could be an incontrovertible part of this absent-IDO immunology in a way similar to how Feynman diagrams were an incontrovertible part of quantum theoretic perturbation expansions, even if they were developed nearly two decades after the first of such expansions. This is to say one has two versions of a science, both of which contain perhaps the same truths—or at least the potential for the same truths, in a community-accepted framing of the word—and yet are different because the way one frames the science and the way said framing is interpreted—e.g, in the case of perturbative quantum field theory as a diagrammatic expansion or something which is non-pictorial and only analytical—affects what is discovered and hence what practitioners consider is constitutive of the science. Hacking's example, following the IDO story, is that the interpretation of the enzyme IDO is framed around its role in "destroying" the amino acid tryptophan which itself is used by  "the mother's immune sentries, called T cells" to do their job, but is it possible "imagine an immunology that was at least as 'successful' as present immunology," and which was not framed around this quasi-militaristic terminology of "destroying" and "sentries"? Represented more generally, this is Hacking's second refinement of the question:

"We ask: If the results R of a scientific investigation are correct would any investigation of roughly the same subject matter, if successful, at least implicitly contain or imply the same results? [italics his]"

There are interesting questions contained within this question. One is how do we determine whether "R" is indeed "correct"? Perhaps we should replace "correct"—a word which may drag us into questions about absolute truth—with the phrase "accepted by the current scientific community." I think such a replacement is in particular necessary when we are considering the interpretation of theoretical and experimental results. I think for much of the early 20th century, the "correct" explanation of genetic inheritance was that it was communicated through proteins. And when neutrinos were first discovered it was considered "correct" that they were massless. The possible counter-claim that such explanations were not indeed "correct" because we later found them to have layers and better explanations hidden underneath sort of justifies my rephrasing: If you claim correctness is something that can only be evaluated in the future, then what you are actually describing is a contingent community-level acceptance rather than a "correctness" which connotes absolute truth absolute. Moreover who is the person or group of people deciding whether the results of an investigation are correct? And if a decision is indeed being made by such people, how can we be sure that such decisions are connected to what is truly "correct"? 

So I would like to rephrase Hacking's question to be "We ask: If the results R of a scientific investigation are accepted by their contemporaneous scientific community, would any investigation of roughly the same subject matter, if successful, at least implicitly contain or imply the same results?

He warns that this question could descend into tautology: If we only call this alternative theory "successful" if it does everything that our successful science does, then this alternative science is not really an alternative at all. In this sense, those who require a concrete and measurable standard of success for this alternative science, a standard which demands that the alternative science be essentially equivalent to our version of it, render perhaps unknowingly the question as empty. 

Hacking's gives an example of how seemingly important questions about the inevitability of science can descend into tautology once analyzed. The example concerns the velocity of light and goes through a series of claims to show that the common realist claim that "the velocity of light is a fact" is not as incontrovertible as it seems to be. The first claim is that "The velocity of light is a fundamental constant of nature. It is about 186, 282 miles per second," and any "successful" science which considers the question and works to find the answer would eventually find it. Hacking takes this assertion to be false, since the fact of the finiteness of the velocity of light was difficult to come by and experimenters who thought of the possibility around the time of Galileo would have been unlikely to get an answer. 

So the claim could be sharpened to "If some people ask the question, and work hard at answering it, and get an answer, they will determine that the velocity of light is about 186,000 miles per second." Hacking thinks this too is false. He cites Ole Römer (1644-1710) who was one of the most talented astronomers of his time and was able to infer, from data on the velocity of Earth's approach and departure from Jupiter, that the velocity of light was was about 140,000 miles per second, a number that is close to, but decidedly different from the accepted one. Perhaps his equipment was a limitation?

Thus, a subsequent sharper claim is that "if other people were to use our equipment, with our assumptions, and had acquired the tacit knowledge to use our equipment, then they would get our answer." Hacking doesn't think this reflects hat the realists actually feel since if these "other people" were to get an answer different from our own, we would claim that they had made a mistake. So he thinks a more honest claim is that these other people would get the velocity of light to be about 186,282 miles per second if they use used our techniques and equipment and made no mistakes. This here is where we are at tautology since of course one would get the correct answer if one correctly used all the relevant resources for obtaining that answer. 

Hacking believes that physicists attempt to avoid this descent into tautology by invoking alien beings. 

But his problem with these arguments is that they assume to much about what is deducible and our ability to translate other people's (or alien's) results and language into our own. If we can translate such languages into our own then that presumed that their thinking and beliefs are somewhat like our own, but this suggests an equivalence which could return us to tautology. And deducibility is not inevitable because it often requires supporting and non-deductive constructs to be lead to a supposedly desired answer. As Hacking notes, much of the 19th century work in celestial and analytical mechanics is deducible in some sense from Newton's laws and the law of gravitation but much of it requires additional mathematics like Fourier Series, integral equations, functional analysis (perhaps, as a counterargument, themselves deducible from calculus) to obtain. 

The concise statement of the constructionist argument (as opposed to the realist argument) is, for physics

physics (theoretical, experimental, material) could have developed in for example a non-quarky way, and, by the detailed standard that would have evolved with this alternative physics, could have been as successful as recent physics has by its detailed standards. 
there is no well-understood sense in which this imagined alternative physics would be equivalent to present physics. 

Hacking doesn't deeply analyze this claim (perhaps because he spent much of the prior part of the essay doing so) but notes that most physicists would disagree with it, since these physicist see things like Maxwell's Equations, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics as incontrovertible laws of physics. Instead, Hacking says he doesn't completely agree with this constructionist view but rather thinks a distinction should be made between the content of science (i.e., its answers) and its form (i.e., the questions which make sense within the science). In this way he is invoking Kuhn's sense of paradigm; Kuhn claims that different paradigms in different sciences are so distinct that the problems in a pre-revolutionary science don't make complete sense in a post-revolutionary context. Hacking seems to agree with the essence of this idea, but he thinks that Nicolas Jardine provides a more useful description of the essential point. Jardine considers a question as "live" if it makes sense to us that it can be true or false or whether it can answered at all. Hacking suggests, for example, that a natural philosopher's answer to the question "How come the mother does not automatically abort the half-foreign baby?" to concern something theological and extra-scientific [Or at least this is my interpretation of the ambiguous paragraph on p. S69]. 

It is after this focus that Hacking makes an interesting distinction between two ways to regard the scientific tool of questions in his larger investigation of the inevitability of science, however he banishes one of these ways as trivial and the other as more interesting and worthy of attention. Here is the distinction 

"First, it is patently obvious that which questions get asked, taken seriously, investigated, funded, reported, analyzed, and so forth is the result of social processes, human interactions, and current interests…No one doubts all that. [Rather] I am concerned with the more abstract issue of what questions make sense. That too is the product of human history and it seems to me to be a contingent human history." (p. S69)

I agree the second way has some deeper philosophical resonance to it, but I don't think it is at all true that "No one doubts…" that "which questions get asked, taken seriously, investigated, funded… are the result of social processes, human interactions, and current interests." Indeed this is largely the very debate that Sabine Hossenfelder is having with the high energy physics community. Hossenfelder claims that the attachment this community has to supersymmetry, AdS/CFT correspondence, stringy physics, etc. is more grounded in social processes than clean logical justification and almost all high energy theorists disagree with her by citing the same set of aesthetic (i.e., non-empirical and not cleanly logical reasons) for why these theories should be pursued. So, not everyone believes that the current set of questions which get asked in science were selected through mostly social processes, or if scientists do believe this they believe it in an empty or contradictory way in which it doesn't matter if these questions were selected by social processes because they are the correct questions we should be asking. 

Hacking exemplifies his second concern by saying that it is the same as Keller's long-standing one about the genetic code. "As I see it, Keller has been arguing for quite some time that the notion of the genetic code, the master controller nature of the organism, has determined which questions about inheritance make sense—and we need not have had that controlling idea at all. 

The problem with this discussion is that it can lead to a sort of a simple contradiction if we were to try to devise an example. Namely, if we were to try to come up with an example of a question which does not make sense according to, for example, our notion of the genetic code then by successfully coming up with said question and successfully interpreting it, then the question would have "made sense" of that question, but if we were to come up with a question which did not make sense from our current perspective of science, then we would consider the question to not be scientific and hence not conceivably possible of any alternative science. 

Perhaps an analogy is better than examples. The claim that Hacking supports is somewhat akin to speaking one language and then claiming that it is possible to think of a word (i.e., a sequence of letters) which does not make sense in our language but makes sense in another. Of course, such a possibility is clear in our multilingual world, but I say "somewhat" because the analogy is not perfect. Words (again, letter sequences) that don't make sense in our language can, if they make sense in another language, be translated with a dictionary into words that do make sense in our own. So this example, if we were to use it as an example of what Hacking is referring to, would not be a good one because these seemingly non-sensical words can be associated with dictionaries which render them sense-making and thus equivalent in some way to the language that makes sense to us. But Hacking is saying that it is possible to conceive of a science in which the questions of that science do not make sense to us, even if said science is as successful to its practitioners (who can make sense of such questions). So, to really get at what Hacking was referring to, we would need to think of possible words that do not make sense to us in our own language, but which make sense in other languages and which also cannot be reliably translated from those languages into ones we understand. There are actually clear examples of such words in the relations between human languages but these words comprise only a small part of the associated language so that one could say that if the analogy were absolute, then this alternative science would only have a few results which cannot be "made-sense-of" in our own science. Thus, a more appropriate analogy would be if there were entire languages which made sense to one group of people but which were also incapable of being translated into our own language, but then if such languages were to exist, we might (from a purely definitional perspective) not consider them to be languages at all since they would have a feature (i.e., their untranslatability to our own language, say English or Mandarin) that no other modern languages have. 

Here is part of Hacking's conclusion

"Social and historical events do determine whether or not we find answers to a live question, or discover that the live question, as asked, has no answer. I am saying against my constructionist friends, that answers to live questions about the natural world have nothing to do with us…What I do think is contingent on human history is not only the questions we in fact address (obviously and trivially contingent) but the family of questions that make sense, which are live, and which I am inclined to call the form of scientific knowledge, in order to make the contrast with its content [i.e., its answers]." (p. S70)

I think Hacking's focus is really interesting. He asserts that he doesn't believe that the answers that result from sensible questions are the result of social or historical events, but rather the questions that originate them are. I am not entirely sure how you can separate the two; in particular, Hacking himself said that the statement of a sensible question in a way frames the possible answers to it. But taking Hacking somewhat more superficially he is placing the essence of the question "Do you think science is socially constructed?" in the framing of "Do you think the questions which make sense in science to day were socially constructed?" Even this seems incomplete, because it suggests something more explicit than what Hacking is referring to. Rather he is wondering (and answering in the negative) whether the questions which make sense were inevitable by-products of a study of the natural world, namely that if we were to start human history again (like some sort of simulation) and humans were to develop a version of science, would the questions that said science asks make sense to us, or, equivalently, be translatable into our science?  

Here is Hacking's conclusion stated again near the end of the piece

"I think that the 'forms' of scientific knowledge could have been different, yet still, we would be recognizably exploring the same aspects of nature. But if they were different we might be as successful as at present (on Lakatsoian criteria), yet not obtain results equivalent to or implying our present results." (p. S71)

Really cool piece of philosophy of science.

Weekly Review 
I'm still working on the "Self-Assembly of a Dimer System" paper, but I have high hopes that this will be the last week that I actually add new material to it. The main changes that I've made is to restructure the "ssDNA+ssDNA to dsDNA" and "proteins-protein interactions" sections, by providing a more robust argument for estimating the pivotal energy term in the former and changing the discussion of inequalities in the latter. After reading through Santa Lucia's 1998 paper on DNA binding energies, I was able to write some code to compute the binding free energy of any given sequence of ssDNA with its complement. Moreover, one can easily incorporate the effects of salt concentration on this binding energy. Writing up this code was really a fun and short exercise in computational biology. 

There is something strange about my results though. I randomly generated 10^6 20-nucleotide long sequences of ssDNA and computed the binding free energy for each with its complement in a 50mM solution of Na^+. Computing some basic statistical properties of these results, I found an average binding free energy of -17.9 kcal/mol and a standard deviation of about 2.6 kcal/mol for this collection of 10^6 sequences. What is strange however, is that I obtained essentially the same mean and standard deviation when I randomly generated 10^5, 10^4, and 10^3 20-nucleotide long sequences. The persistence of these results is strange to me because they seem to violate a basic corollary of the central limit theorem in which increasing the number of random variables, each of which is drawn from the same distribution, leads to a decrease in the standard deviation of the sum of those random variables. For example, if I were to compute the mean and standard deviation of the many different draws of a binomial distribution, then I should find that the standard deviation increases as I decrease the number of draws I make. But that doesn't seem to be the case her. 

(There are two potential errors that you are making: Either you are incorrect in assuming that there is a distribution for these energies which is consistent with the properties of distributions the central limit theorem studies, or you incorrect in assuming that the standard deviation you calculate should go to zero as you increase the number of drawn elements.)

-> It turns out to be the second error. What I'm actually calculating is the true standard deviation of the distribution of binding free energies, and thus this value, rather than going to zero, simply becomes more and more accurate as I increase the number of drawn elements. You can check this with the following python code:

np.std(np.random.binomial(10, 0.5, 100000))

This code generates 100000 runs of a 10-coin-flip game. Namely you flip a coin 10 times, count the number of heads and that amounts to one game. You then repeat this 100000 times and calculate the standard deviation. What you find is that the standard deviation is close to 1.58 which is what one predicts for the standard deviation of the number of heads for 10 fair coin flips. Increasing the number of runs does not appreciably change the calculated standard deviation; it just brings it closer to the theoretical value. 

OK! Back to the update. What remains to be done is to complete the discussion in the protein-protein interactions section. I have realized that it doesn't make sense to try to calculate the conditions under which real protein-protein systems have assumed the fully correct dimerization regime since the ssDNA and TF-Protein systems studied in the prior sections suggest that the temperature at which this regime is achieved is ~150 Kelvin, essentially half of physiological temperatures. Thus, any limit which assumes the achievability of this particular behavior for protein systems at physiological temperatures is already founded on an assumption which is inconsistent with the results of analyses of the other systems I studied. 

So finding the conditions for complete dimerization are out. A better question is under what conditions is the system Type I versus Type II. This is a better question since a Type I system can have the property that even when it is partially dimerized, these dimers consist mostly of correct contacts. Using some inequalities and reasonable assumptions about the values of  and  I found that a necessary but insufficient condition for the system to be of Type I is for the number of different monomers in the system to satisfy



where  (Energy of a monomer with a de Broglie length on the scale of the system), or, written with volume explicit, 



where . I need to emphasize that this result is an necessary but insufficient condition for a system to be Type I. Namely, it is possible for the system to satisfy this condition and still not be Type I, but if the system does not satisfy this condition, it is certainly not Type I. I think this condition is more relevant for the protein-protein interactions system and I should be able to use it to obtain some limit on the diversity of proteins in my bag of proteins system. What might render this task difficult is getting a precise estimate on Δ/E0. 

In writing news, I've managed to write most days last week. Much of this writing has been based on science and sociology of science articles I have read. I actually like doing this, although I also think I should write pieces more motivated by my own thought processes rather than just reflections. 

Also, I have improved on my draft of "Old Price, New Ticket" by adding a section explaining what I think has changed about Asian Americans (I really do hate that term) feelings about Affirmative Action. Basically, I think back in the 60s and 70s when affirmative action was re-interpreted as diversity for the better education of white people, Asian Americans could benefit from affirmative action policies. But now that the constitute a plurality of the populations represented in colleges, these policies no longer benefit them. One problem with this argument is that not all asian Americans have changed their opinion about affirmative actions, but the fact that some groups have suggests their previous belief in the policy was perhaps more motivated by opportunism rather than a deep abiding interest in being on the right-side of history. There is no problem with self-interest of course, as long as said self-interest doesn't bastardize the narratives of history and attempt to paint itself ahistorically as justice and equitability. 

What is also missing in the draft is the acknowledgment that the average personality scores for Asian Americans in Harvard's internal ranking system are so statistically unlikely that we should reasonably conclude that the admissions committee was seeking post-hoc reasons to depress the number of Asian applicants, was defining these personality scores based on stereotypes surrounding the demographic identities of these applicant, or maybe even both. We should conclude this unless, of course, we are willing to accept that, for whatever reason, Asian Americans have worse (at least on Harvard's scale) personalities than other groups. Most egalitarians (and most people who support affirmative action) do not accept this, and thus the Harvard case is problematic. But what is perhaps ironic is that although people can immediately recognize that the evaluation of certain demographic groups as having worse personalities than others is "problematic" and indication of bias, many people are perfectly willing to accept as equitable and meritocratic a society in which certain demographic groups score, on average, standard deviations less than other groups in a scholastic aptitude test. The ability to clearly recognize problems in one and a largely somnolent acceptance of the other might have more to do with America's naive and ahistorical notions about meritocracy and objectivity than it does with the legacy of ideas about the intelligence of black and latino people, although in truth it is likely difficult to separate the two. Consequently, the case brought by the anonymous Asian American plaintiffs in the SFFA case feels ironic in a way unassociated with the fact that a demographic minority (at least at the population level) is attempting to eliminate a policy that is supposed to help demographic minorities: The second irony is that this group is arguing the case based on a recognition of their discrimination in the local context of university admissions in the past decade, and in so doing is seeking to dismantle policies meant to repair the larger context of an America-wide discrimination over the course of its history. 

Also I think I've buried the lede. There must be some way to introduce my focus and interest in the Harvard case at the beginning of the essay and do so in a way which is natural.

My goal is to finish a draft of this essay and send it to Victor for some commentary. I'd like to get at least one set of eyes on the piece before I try to send it to Suzanne. 

Goals for this week
Write up protein-protein interactions section.
Write up analysis on the divide between Type I and II systems and the derivation of conditions for fully correct assembly
Add 2N vs. V/λ0^3 plot to the parameter space plots
Complete draft of "Old Price, New Ticket" and send to Victor
Write up Wright and Fisher and Kimura problems 

from the way 

Optimism leads me to believe that the acceptance of the recognition of the former as unfair and of the latter as unavoidable, 

The acceptance of one and the repudiation/rejection of the other has more to do with our ahistorical sense of meritocracy and objectivity than it does with racial stereotypes, although it is really difficult to separate the two. 

Not all asian American

"What they are seeking is not merely assimilation into American society but acceptance into the ranks of the socioeconomically advantaged/economic elite in that society. In this sense the ticket has changed and the price has not. The end goal is slightly different, making as it does fine distinctions in the class structure of society, but to get there one still has to ignore the history of the country and develop a rather selective sense of what constitutes justice and fairness. 

There is still a repudiation of beliefs/ideas/systems which could support the economically disenfranchised and this repudiation is still done in the name of achieving a good and profitable life in this country. But what is sought is not mere assimilation into American society but acceptance into the ranks of the socioeconomically advantaged in this society. "

The price was previously a gradual loss of ethnic identity and a gradual adjustment to America's black-white antithesis. The new price seems to be 

——
Not all Asian Americans have changed their opinion along this axis, but some groups have which suggests the previous support was mostly opportunism rather than an actual interest in achieving justice in this country.

Evolutionary Contingency Thesis
I'm reading an article by John Beatty which presents what he calls the evolutionary contingency thesis (ECT). The brunt of the claim is that there are no "laws" of biology because all generalizations about the living world:

are just mathematical, physical, or chemical generalization (or deductive consequences of those generalization plus initial conditions)
are distinctively biological, but which are, consequently, contingent outcomes of evolution. 

Part of me is having trouble seeing substance of these claims. The term "evolution" is applied outside of physics either to the evolution of life or of the various properties of said life, so it seems obvious (and somewhat tautological) to claim that the generalizations we find that are distinctively biological are contingent outcomes of evolution: Biology is the study of life and life itself is a "contingent outcome of evolution" so of course what we discover in biology is contingent on evolution. 

Moreover Beatty's sense of a law seems unfairly strict for biology and not similarly strict for physics. For example, he dismisses Mendel's "50%-50%" law of sexual inheritance, and the Krebs cycle as "laws of biology" because it is known that there are inheritance patterns which do not follow the 50%-50% division and it is known that the Krebs cycle is not used in all organisms. He explains his motivation as follows "Laws of nature are supposed to be true as a matter of empirical fact, and not just as a matter of logic and mathematics."(p. 23) So, seemingly because Mendel's law and the Krebs cycle violate empirical fact—a term which itself can be unpacked because who or what determines what this fact is?—we cannot consider them to be laws of nature. But there are many laws of nature that violate empirical fact, the most well known of them being Newton's laws of motion and gravitation. Maxwell's equations are supposedly laws of electromagnetism but we know that there are quantum corrections to them and there are universe scenarios in which magnetic monopoles exist and where, hence, our standard form of the laws do not apply. The law of conservation of energy is not well defined in general relativity because energy itself is not well-defined, and the second law of thermodynamics has interpretation difficulties if we track it to before the big bang. 

He disagrees with including contingencies to rescue these laws (i.e., with claiming these laws are not generally applicable but only applicable in certain cases) but he does not acknowledge that physics is riddled with such contingencies in its own framing of its laws. Here is my question: if Beatty's archetype for a natural law (i.e., a physical one) fails his standards for what constitutes a natural law, why should he expect biological laws to satisfy them, and if they do not satisfy them, why does he expect such a result to be a mark against biology and not physics?

His is essentially an "anti-emergist" position, one which argues that there is nothing necessarily true about what we discern in the study of life and anything necessarily true can be reduced to mathematical, physical, or chemical principles which themselves are apparently necessarily true. 

I disagree with this position for two reasons, one more foundational than the other. Just because a description of a phenomena is not "necessarily true" by our standards of the phrase does not mean that attempting to abstract general principles concerning said phenomena does not contribute to the same project of science that other supposedly "necessarily true" descriptions do. For example, the central dogma of biology (the way proteins are manufactured from DNA sequences) is a generalization of biology, which although not applicable in all cases (there are examples RNA self-replicating without a DNA template) is still a useful framework by which to understand some less foundational aspects of genetics like genetic diseases. 

More fundamentally, in physics, the discipline ostensibly at the foundation of much of science, there are no "necessarily true" laws, which is to say there are no laws which we believe must be true of any universe conceivable. Indeed, the essence of a physical law is something that we postulate without any claim as to its universal truth value and then use to make testable deductions about the world. Moreover, it is not absolutely clear that the laws that exist in our universe are not the result of cosmological evolution akin to the biological evolution that Beatty cites as the reason biological generalizations are not laws.

The problem with Beatty's line of argument (i.e., that physical laws, unlike biological ones, are necessarily true even in spite of our particular cosmological evolution) is that in attempting to rescue physical laws as laws in of themselves, we can be led into anthropic arguments which if they are accepted in the case of physics must also be accepted in the case of biology and thus render the Beatty's main claim—that the evolutionary contingency of biological laws is a reason why they are not in fact natural laws—much weaker. We could say that the physical laws as they exist in our universe may indeed not be necessarily true, but in order for us (i.e., animals with the cognitive capacity to study such laws) to be able to discern these laws they had to be what they are and thus it is useful to take them as a foundational principle. 

I see the essence of Beatty's argument as mostly a definitional one rather than one which should substantively change the way biologist seek to understand life. Either, as I think, there are no natural laws that satisfy Beatty's high and largely normative (rather than descriptive) standards for what a natural law should be, or we find, through some rewriting of his claims, that the only laws which satisfy these standards exist in physics and chemistry and we consequently need to call the generalizations of biology something else. In either case, both the natural laws of the physical sciences and the generalizations in biology satisfy the common functional purpose of attempting to depict a large set of phenomena as being governed by the same foundational principles, and in this sense both contribute to the larger project of science.

Writing Topics
Sudoku in a Burning House: Why does doing basic science (or maybe theoretical science) today with global climate change around the corner/already, feel like doing sudoku in a burning house? Somewhat like the way scientists in the mid 1950s always felt nuclear devastation was around the corner? Is this a necessary aspect of the work? (November 21, 2018)

Intelligence in an Intellectual Space: Discuss how my ideas about intelligence and hard work were shaped by beliefs about black people and their intellectual ability and that I was only able to escape these beliefs after I read Baldwin and realized I had nothing to prove. (November 22, 2018)

Affirmation and Academia: Unlike the popular conception, academic work is not truly different from non-academic work. There are still structures of power committing people to do things they would otherwise not do if the incentive of possible future advancement/monetary reward/etc were not present. (November 22, 2018) 

Meta writing on Race and IQ
I'm not sure exactly what the goal of this writing project is. I do have an idea of what I want to discuss but there is no larger purpose that these ideas are geared towards. I think the Gattaca introduction is compelling—although less so on a fourth or fifth reading—but the introduction leads to questions about how diligence intersects with ideas about intelligence and the various caste systems in our country. What am I trying to say by using the story in this film as an introduction? That there exists a movie in Hollywood with the common narrative that persistence and diligence can triumph over talent? What is wrong with this narrative? Why do I dislike it so much?

It always struck me on some level as subtly racist, the idea that certain groups of people could achieve success through dint of their natural genius and intelligence and others endowed with fewer gifts, had to bust their asses to get half as far. Undoubtedly this was my insecurity talking, and I know this for two reasons. For one, these statements about grit and persistence were rarely expressed in an explicitly racial context or even in a way in which one could make the ungracious assumption that the speaker was trying to make a racial statement. For two, people who have managed to do something which seems intellectually noteworthy, state themselves that the main contributor to their success was persistence rather than some more ambiguous notion of talent. I mean, just last week I read a paper which asked 60 physicists "What qualities do you think were the most important in achieving your success?" and 50% of them said persistence followed by 25% who said intelligence. So if this grit-over-talent narrative is being promulgated by this society as a latent claim that black people need to work much harder than everyone else because they are not as intelligent, then even the physicists are in on it which means that we are probably all doomed. 

So what is the message of the piece now? I watched Gattaca and I was attracted to its message of diligence and dedication, and upon reflection I intuited some vaguely racial undertones to this message, which upon even closer inspection dematerialized and were shown to be more reflective of my own insecurities rather than something which was being told to me by the culture?

Maybe this is the subtle and constant effect of racism, sexism, and all isms in this world. To go through your life experiencing and interpreting interactions and messages through the filter of your identity and to constantly debate with yourself whether what you're experiencing is because of that identity or because of insecurity garnered through previous experiences which were more clearly due to that identity. It is paranoia writ large which is the background to the sense of being part of a group that society disparages or devalues for some reason. Is this happening because I'm X? Or an I interpreting this as happening because I'm X only because of past experiences as X which better justified such interpretations?

How does this relate to the debate on race and IQ? I don't know. I can't exactly remember when I started reading or hearing about the IQ differences between races, but I can say when it started to affect me: My first year of graduate school. I think this started to happen because I had just entered a Physics Ph.D program after a period of years when my interest in physics was waning. This interest in physics had always acted as sort of a beacon for me, something which directed and focused me on the work necessary in becoming a physicist rather than on the external conditions which might support or impede that work. But by the time I entered graduate school, the light of this beacon was mostly extinguished, overused as it was to guide me to the place where I now found myself in darkness. Moreover, I had so dedicated myself to the goal of becoming a physicist that I hadn't taken time to cultivate the skills needed to pursue any other route. Which meant that all the work I had done to become a physicist had both dissipated any desire to become a physicist and closed off any other routes. In this position of being so lost, I began to do what I had never done before: look for assurances from other people. Of course I didn't find such assurances, instead I found reflected back at me the pernicious messages of a historical moment many of us like to believe we have left behind. I felt constantly communicated to me the sense that I had gotten to this place I had entered not because of all that work, but because of something else and that I did not really belong here. In fact I didn't belong here because I lacked the cognitive ability which would have made that "something else" irrelevant. I think it was in this space that I began reading about demographics and SAT scores, demographics and IQ scores, demographics and graduation rates. And I began forming the natural conclusions even though my life itself seemed to serve as a counter example. Still, I worked constantly. With much of what I previously saw as my identity in tatters, I sought solidity in the constant rhythm of assignments. I didn't engage in this rhythm as adaptively as I should, crashing each week after the end of a week of assignments, but at the end of the year it did help to reassure me that I had not completely lost the ability to engage intellectually with the work of physics, even if my full blown interest had not yet returned. 

I don't want this to be another ode to James Baldwin, but it is true that he released me greatly from any sense that I needed to prove myself to other people. It was after reading Baldwin that I decided to at least try to build my own research project rather than attach myself to a professor's project. The structure of graduate school is something which can, but does not have to be, depicted as a pyramid scheme where people trade on personal affirmation now for some level of affirmation later. What one must constantly do is prove oneself, and in particular to prove oneself in ways that can be easily evaluated and understood by the arbiters of  that proving/your future. This meant working with professors on projects they assigned you, projects which were sub-projects of their own research focus, and which they could thus use to easily evaluate your progress. When I saw a colleague doing something similar with his student and asked him why he was doing this he told me quite rightly "What am I going to do? Assign him something I don't know anything about?" I suppose the danger in that is that you are forced to give up some control over the student and his or her future. Less cynically, I suppose another danger is that you cannot help the student when he inevitably gets stuck. But for me the greater danger was that by working on things I wasn't really interested in I had to find motivation to do the work, not in the subject matter itself, but in my desire to impress the person who assigned it and any other future persons who would permit me later to do similarly self-effacing work. This is how the bargain of a STEM education operates. The claim and idea is that one is given more independence and freedom than someone spending their first years out of graduate school in a consulting or finance position, and this is true. But the larger structure of the work, the hierarchies of power and the constant devaluing of personal interest in order to to find some future position in these hierarchies is very much the same. Working as a STEM graduate student on projects you don't care about is essentially like working at most post-college jobs, except you likely have worse pay and poorer career prospects, but the effects of both are occluded by the veneer of prestige in being connected to a university. And more insidiously than in a job, the process of evaluation in academia operated on both an existential and a professional level: professionally your career aspirations were dependent on your evaluations by those with more power (as in all jobs), and existentially your idea of yourself as a physicist was dependent on the same. 



I was also  in I was essentially working at a job with poor pay and poor career prospects with the veneer of prestige since it was connected to the university. Insidiously of all this process of evaluation operated on both an existential and a professional level, with professionally your career aspirations being dependent on your evaluations by those with more power and existentially your idea of yourself as a physicist being dependent on the same. 

I found three things distasteful about my own education 1) An undue focus on the teacher 2) Making practice subject to evaluation 3) Little voice for the student. I have found in my own teaching that it is really difficult to escape any three of these things in a standard classroom. the standard classroom is lead by a lecturer who assigns homework which is only completed if it is under threat of evaluation and said homework is largely chosen from a syllabus that the student had no hand in creating. I make the situation sound worse than it is. There are ways to subvert these tropes, but finding such ways require thought and creativity. 

All three of these things are present in the standard structure of graduate education on some level. With teacher being replaced with "advisor" or "professor", the practice existing in the thesis or dissertation, and the student having little voice because his or her project is largely assigned by the "advisor". It was partly recognizing this structure which made me reluctant to attend graduate school and it was partly the arrogance that I could escape it which made me ultimately go.

Found the message yet? Is this going to be about Baldwin and how he helped you escape ideas about race and intelligence and about systems and subscription and about fidelity and strength?

The Utility of Contradictions in Theoretical Work
In the past few weeks I have found many inconsistencies and contradictions in the "Self Assembly of a Dimer System" project. Of course such things are annoying, but I can't help but acknowledge that they're really necessary to making any sort of progress. So often when you're doing this kind of work, you aren't sure of what you do or don't understand. You of course know something about the subject otherwise, you wouldn't even be able to do a single calculation. But the calculations you can do seem more like technical exercises, and the larger more conceptually interesting questions are so far beyond your abilities that you cannot even begin thinking of ways to formulate them rigorously. 

So what you're looking for is something of an edge-problem, something which exists just slightly beyond a technical exercise so that you can complete, but which also touches upon in some way a larger question*.

Phrased another way, when you're trying to come up with a theoretical investigation, you are always seeking something that you do not completely understand, but which you understand well enough to formulate a problem about. A contradiction satisfies both requirements in that if you do reach a contradiction, you clearly have not understood something but you have managed to well enough understand the techniques and ideas needed to reach the contradiction. After finding the contradiction, what is necessary is a larger perspective on it. You need to zoom out and pore over your work to find the incorrect assumption or technical error at the contradiction's source. If what you find is an incorrect assumption, and thus an error more fundamental than a mere technical one, then you're likely at the precipice of new knowledge. If you can formulate from the contradiction a specific question, then answering the question would not only resolve that particular contradiction but it would increase your knowledge of the subject so that you are capable of formulating higher level questions. 

Bohr's quote "How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress," gains meaning with this interpretation. Paradoxes, contradictions, inconsistencies. They all suggest something about your knowledge is incomplete and thus they suggest specific areas in that network of knowledge to focus on.

[//]

Often you can find such edge-problems with regard to how they relate to your personal knowledge, but what you find is that solving them doesn't really increase the knowledge of the scientific community writ large because that community has solved the problem before and knows of your method, or doesn't care about your new method of solution.

More meta writing 
Here's an idea for how to structure this piece. Should it be called "Intellect in an Intellectual Space" or "Intelligence in an Intellectual Space"? Should I even be concerned with this now that the piece has yet to be written

What elements do you want the piece to have? 
— Gattaca introduction; interrogate my affinity to the work
— Klein and Harris conversation and comment about history (although I'm not entirely sure how its relevant)
— Mention the Renaissance associated with Baldwin's writings?
— Discussion of Baldwin and intelligence, IQ scores, why they are not relevant?
— Conspiracy and paranoia associated with -isms…

What questions do you want it to explore?
— How important is the link between intelligence and success?
— Are black people really less intelligent than others and if so what implications does this have on their roles in academia
— Did my insecurities in the end even mean anything

What is the introduction and what is the conclusion?
— Introduction: Library in Hayden or Gattaca film
— Conclusion: Reading Baldwin and recognizing that I had nothing to prove.

Editing "Old Price for a New Ticket"
I received comments from Victor on the article. He has four main suggestions: Remove the FOB introduction because it is largely disconnected from the rest of the essay. Discuss precisely what you mean by American meritocracy. Remove the middle section because it seems like a digression. State explicitly what you think the price of the ticket is and who is paying it. 

I'm not sure about removing the FOB introduction. Victor says other than the fact that it is about Asian Americans and assimilation, it isn't related to the rest of the essay. He thinks it'll be much better to begin with the Baldwin quote. I don't know about removing this introduction. I think it functions as a good place setting, but Victor is right that I don't really follow up on the things I introduce in this first paragraph. I think, then, that I should find a way to incorporate this fresh off the boat idea into later sections. For example, the Asian Americans who have the most problems with affirmative action are mostly Chinese Americans and many of them are recently immigrated to this country (citation please). In this sense they are "more fresh" (culturally insensitive!) than there better assimilated friends,  and yet they are the ones who seem to be aligning most closely with the dominant American ideal of meritocracy. Is the reason for this, as I claim, mostly opportunistic? Is it because they realize that their increased representation in the university is no longer dependent/assured if they align themselves with other minority groups? 

And what do I mean about American meritocracy? On one level, I mean the idea that if people work hard enough in America they will "make it", which in the past meant nuclear family plus house plus white picket fence but nowadays has a more basic interpretation: a good college education, a livable income, promotions, all of which you deserve because you have worked so hard to make it all happen. In America this formula of "hard work+time=success"  made sense, or people could pretend that it made sense, so long as the idea was interpreted as being available to only a subset of the American population. Because of course there were many many people over the course of American history who worked hard, in the sun, in the fields, under the whip, and what did they have to show for it? 
//
What is meant by the phrase American meritocracy? American meritocracy is the theory that people succeed in a vacuum. It is the idea that a person earns things in America—a good college education, a livable income, promotions—because he is intelligent, persevering, and entrepreneurial, and  not because the structures around him—decades of social and economic policy, for example—made such things possible. Historically, the idea was only tenable as long as it was understood as being applied to a subset of the American population. Because of course there were many many people over the course of American history who worked hard, in the sun, in the fields, and what did they have to show for it?
//
But the idea is not merely associated with hard work since, we are willing to accept that people have differing abilities and people with differing abilities who work the same amount surely will not net the same outcome. It's the idea that people get what they deserve, that the best people get the best positions.

A Damn Shame
I'm almost 27 years old and I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up. This is somewhat of a banality though. The idea that when you reach the age of 30 or 40 or 50 you will have much of your life squared away, all bills paid, all books balanced. I think I have always known that this wasn't true, but I still like to think that I'm working towards some greater sense of peace and achievement in my life, some feeling that I am not failing by merely existing and being unable to make of that existence something meaningful. What is meaningful? Damn good question.  I suppose if I knew the answer to that question I would busy living it rather than writing self-indulgent musing about my inability to even conceive of a good-faith answer. Yes, yes. We create our own meaning, but what if the meaning we create still leaves us feeling like our lives are meaningless. I am convinced that such questions are not really helpful, that one can go around in circles chasing something, some apparition and never discover that one was, rather than an explorer in a cave, a dog running after its tail. 

So yes, I know this is fruitless, and I promise I will stop soon. This short note is somewhat like a missive indicating that I still think about these things, even if it seems like my life and my sense of my self is better than it was four years ago. Even long before then I had realized that meaning is best found, not through a philosophical interrogation of its nature, but by living life in pursuit of what you value and making peace with the fact that some dreams will remain unrealized. That I think is still the lesson today.

Details of SFFA's Case Against Harvard
- Plaintiffs in the case are anonymous, but it is understood that they are Asian Americans
- “a permanent injunction requiring Harvard to conduct all admissions in a manner that does not permit those engaged in the decisional process to be aware of or learn the race or ethnicity of any applicant for admission.”

Weekly Review
I sent Victor the draft of "Old Price for a New Ticket." He gave me some really good feedback. I hope to fully incorporate his feedback into the draft by the middle of the week and try to schedule a meeting with Suzanne or one of her assistants to discuss it again. I wonder if I could send it to a magazine? How would I even do this?

I've reached another roadblock in the "Self-Assembly of a Dimer System" Project. The problem is that my model is formulated in terms of energy and all data for biomolecular binding is given in terms of Gibbs free energies. I previously assumed that I could just use these Gibbs free energies as my own energy terms, and thus take my own energy term to be an effective energy averaged over unaccounted for microstates. However, in writing out the partition function, I already separated out the translational entropy by computing the partition function for the free dimers and free monomers, so it would be double-counting to claim that my energy term represents an effective free energy which itself includes translational entropy contributions. 

There are two steps I need to take in reconciling the data and the parameters of my model. I need to first compute the Helmholtz free energy from the Gibbs free energy, and then I need to compute the energy of binding from this Gibbs free energy. That way I would have energy parameters at least on the scale of what they are in the corresponding biomolecular system. However the model would still not be perfectly applicable, since all other entropies (rotational/ vibrational) would be included in the effective energy parameters E0 and Delta, and while these energies are considered independent of temperature in the model, the entropies which are included in them are not. 

There are three routes here: 
Remove the biophysics section until you can make a cleaner account of the energies of the various reactions. The paper would then be entirely theoretical with no attempt made to find correspondence with experimental results. 
Extend the theoretical section to include the vibrational and rotational contributions to dimer states; (I think this should be mentioned in the discussion anyway with an adjoining equation)
Keep the sections as they are but make clear that the energies you obtain are purely effective and thus do not represent the true energies of the system of interest. You would have to be more careful about your calculation of energy from Gibbs free energy, but the fact that this inevitably effective energy is dependent on temperature in reality and is constant in your model, need not be attended to since your results are purely approximate. 

Another potential challenge. If I find someway to correctly compute the relevant energies and I find that they violate the inequality for a Type I and II system, what then? 

Goals? 
— Figure out how to parse this contradiction between data and theoretical assumptions
— Create 2N vs V plot 
— Create problems on Wright-Fisher, and Kimura, and additional Moran Process Exercises
— Send Suzanne email about editing essay
— Send Vinny, Eugene, and Michael notice about Dissertation dates 

I already separated out the translational entropy when I wrote out the partition function, so it would be incorrect to include these terms again.

Metawriting on "Intellect in an Intellectual Space"
I am faced with two routes for this essay. Currently it seems to be turning into a long-form personal piece where I outline what has led me to arrive at my current place and position. But I don't want to write a personal piece. It is not exactly clear to me what I want to write, but I know I am aiming for something more along the lines of the story of a person trying to understand what intellect is and how it operates in spaces in which he or she feels he is not supposed be. My personal story is of course relevant in this more general story, but I feel somewhat like I'm getting distracted by going into the details of my loss and subsequent restoring of interest in physics. The main theme in that personal story is that the loss was not due to racist ideas about intellect; rather it was due to the structure of education and the fact that having been a good student all my life, I couldn't cleanly separate my actions as that good student from the actions I felt were more in line with my interests. I had to work on the problem sets I was assigned. And I had to work on them with an alacrity and a focus which suggested that these things were inline with my interests. The result was a gradual decaying of those interests. 

How did ideas about intellect factor into all of this? One part of me wanted to continue to do well academically, so that I could continue to be viewed as a good student. Being a good student may have been so fundamental to my identity because I felt that as a black student in academia, as a black student having done well in academia for so long, I needed to continue this streak, needed to continue to prove to everyone with explicit or implicit ideas to the contrary that I deserved to be here. Eventually, I was pushed to do well at MIT because of fear, not because of love. And that fear certainly did color what I had previously loved. 

I should be specific. I came to MIT with many prerequisites under my belt. I had never taken a physics class had never taken calculus, but I had taken the Calculus BC exam and both AP Physics C exams. I was also able to test out of Multivariable Calculus. Having spent so much time studying physics on my own, I was deeply curious to see what it would be like to take a physics class in a university, especially one as prestigious and as focused on science and mathematics as MIT. Also, I was impatient. I tried to take quantum mechanics my first semester and was promptly vetoed by my freshman advisor and his boss. I was also preoccupied with pledging a new fraternity. Maybe I had too many distractions that semester. But it didn't matter too much. I managed to do well. Or at least well enough.

I am still skirting around the issue. I loved physics when I entered MIT and I did not when I left. What was different? What had MIT done to me, what had I let it do to me, or what had I done to myself? These changes always come incrementally. One does not fall in love one day, and then on some other wake up and find that love is gone. Rather on that fateful day you recognize that love is gone because it had been slowly slipping away for months or years, and you are only now realizing it. 
[The process of reclaiming love is similarly slow, but not at all as passive. It requires effort and focus and time in amounts difficult to anticipate, all for the simple goal of mending bridges that have fallen into disrepair more often due to neglect than to fire.]

I was a third of my way into my physics Ph. D before I began to see physics again, before I began

The structure of any education is one that is dictated by those who are providing that education. The individual subject to this system has freedom to the extent that the system's creators allow it, or to the extent that he or she can wrest that freedom from the dictates of the system. If you are to become a physics major at a school like MIT you have to take the courses that the school requires. This is the bargain: You could go to a different school, perhaps not go to school at all, and find a more flexible approach to your education. But then after all of your studying you would not walk away with one of the central purposes of institutional education: The accreditation that you take with you and then show to all manner of people who do not know you but know your institution. You gain status that way, through your affiliation with a community that already has status. That is primarily the function of an education in a society like ours. I suppose there are also the relationships and networks which are fostered in that environment in which the status is built, but I think in terms of the subsequent course of your life, it is the status which is of paramount importance. 

There is the ever-present danger of taking something you love and trying to make a career out of it, a danger made ever more difficult to evade if that thing that you love already has a ready-made path for professionalization. When you learn physics on your own, your mind is given time to steep in the questions of the discipline. You explore for yourself, over weeks or months, ideas that physics courses often gloss over. From such engagement, you walk away with a deep appreciation of physics partly grounded in what it says about our world, but more deeply from the fact that it is capable of saying anything at all. And if you spend some additional time reading about the history of physics, you walk away with the more troubling knowledge—troubling because it thrusts on you responsibility—that all of the theories of nature, all the elaborate mathematical models which lend structure to reality have been created not by gods of intellect, but by mortals with insecurity, with failings had been created by people and the idea to which faith can be attached that knowledge need not be discovered but can be created. 

In high school, I remember putting the palm of my hand flat on a wall and trying to understand what it meant for a force to have an equal and opposite force. 

But in a physics course, in physics education in general both elements are missing. There is no time for any steady engagement with the philosophy of knowledge underpinning many ideas of physics; instead there is often the sense that such philosophy is irrelevant to the practice of physics at all. And what one gets of the history is the shallow regurgitation of the hagiography that most people already know. Little is done to humanize the famous scientists, to make the student understand the life conditions which made their work possible, and to recognize those conditions as not too different from his or her own. 

Except that they are different. Physics for much of its history was done by only a part of the global population (men of European descent), and this part certainly trafficked in a history different from the other parts. It is not surprising that courses make no effort to depict the famous scientists as relatable proxies of modern students; they are not. They are different from us in the society they grew up in and in what that society said about their ability to do their work. What the student should take from this is not the idea that they have to have life histories exactly like those of the founders of physics, but that life histories can contribute to ones work in the subject and with these histories being so various one need not pigeon hole oneself into repeating the narratives lived by other people. 


So as I was taking physics courses at MIT, the two things which drew me to the subject absent—the larger meaning of being able to create knowledge and the fact of that knowledge's creation at the hands of mortals—I had to latch on to what the institution and the courses claimed was the essence of physics. And the essence consisted of problem-solving, question-answering, the narrow investigations which built the analytical skills seemingly necessary to know subjects like classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, etc. Years into the physics major, it was clear that the skills I was building in the physics major were just the physics analog of the skills that Murray and Hernstien claimed certain demographics had in spades. I had always known such skills were important, but I had never believed them to be totalizing. But in the central courses at MIT that is precisely what they were depicted as. Solve this problem under these conditions and use all the mathematical and technical apparatus provided to you over the course of the semester to do so. 

I had always been good at solving such questions, but when I was studying on my own, I solved these questions always with a larger goal or question in mind. In school, this larger context was absent and soon the only reason I had to answer these questions was to ensure high enough grades to impress the academic overlords who determined my acceptance in to the physics profession. 

In the end, this change of focus changed my interest in physics. During my last semester at MIT, I had to complete a thesis in a speculative area of particle physics. Years before, I would have claimed that doing this work was a dream, but now that I was doing it, and had gone through the hoops necessary to be able to do it, all I wanted to do was sit in the library and read Marvel comics. That last semester was a struggle, both because of the work I had to complete and also because it was being completed with he knowledge that I no longer wanted to do similar work in the future. But I had spent all my time at MIT preparing myself to do such work, and it was the only thing I was qualified for. And then there was the fact of my graduate school acceptances. 

With one's values gone and decayed, the standard response is to take on the values of the environment, but sometimes these values are not positive ones, values not conducive to your personal growth. [//] [writing time: 1 hour]

Metawriting on Intellect in an Intellectual Space

This is not going to be a screed against education. I think I have already written many such screeds and the topic for this essay is not really education itself but how education mixes with things like race and stories even as it separates from them. Work is the mechanical expiation of egotism. It is to replace one's sense of self with a sense of motion and to thereby see the world as something other than a mirror. But in a university mirrors abound and you constantly see your grades, extracurriculars, and professor evaluations as reflections of something fundamental in you. You continue 


When people ask me what I learned at MIT, I always tell them I learned to be exhausted, totally spent, and to continue working anyway. This is a romantic answer one which is only half true. I because the truth of education by firehose is that one walks away wet but still thirsty. Thirstier still if the firehose was geared towards sating a desire you never had in the first place. 

You withstand the onslaught, the pressure, the force, becoming in someway stronger for the effort but also weaker because nothing replenished that effort itself. 

It is somewhat true that getting an education 



because it is your reflection 


and thereby make connection with some larger almost cosmic force in the world. At MIT I worked hard partly out of interest, partly out of insecurity, and partly out of a bare need to beat back an ever encroaching void. I think I spent so much time alone in dimly lit rooms during high school for the same reason. The purpose of physics was to fill something that was missing. Or at least this was its initial purpose. Soon I found something better than the mere escape from loneliness that I was looking for. I found something which was worthwhile in and of itself, and soon I felt compelled to pursue this thing where ever it would take me. 

The world as presented to us by physics is one of logic and order one which suggests somewhat falsely that there is a logic behind everything. The ultimate recognition of this falsity can be devastating when one comes to recognize it fully. Especially if the recognition is precipitated by the logic of physics itself. I like to think I was a good student at MIT. For a few semesters at least. I came in with gusto and confidence, and feeling somewhat like a man who has just made it ashore. At last I was here, the intellectual pinnacle of the physics world. Affiliated with Schwinger, Feynman, and Weinberg and Gell-Mann and Lightman. Here was finally my chance to learn what physics was from real live people and not merely from old textbooks in the libraries of the University of New Orleans. 

I'm going to give you a physics problem. Don't be scared. I'm not asking you to solve it. Here it is. 
	
	(Physics Problem)

I want you to consider the form of it. Is it reminiscent of anything you've seen before, something you've seen in this essay perhaps? This is what much of physics education is like. Students are given short puzzles to solve and they work though it applying the techniques they learned in their course. The question has an answer a specific one and although the answer can connect in someway to some larger purpose, it hardly ever is made to connect. 

Much of going through a physics education, largely any technical education framed around the solution to problems in problem sets, the working through of mathematical exercises, creating computer programs to solve some problem, is like working through a domain specific IQ test. Now, I was someone who had done well on such tests, or their proxies, all my life, but it took me some time to realize why I didn't like the fact that such tests had impeded on my physics education. Physics was supposed to be apart from the narrow technical questions which were geared toward purposes other than finding an answer, purposes more focused on measuring and sorting people according to values presumed to be universal. But at MIT, I imagine at most schools, the focus is on the puzzle-solving, that cerebral activity which is much like doing push-ups in a weight gym, something that builds only a limited part of the skills you need to engage in the wider environment. 

I mean this to say that as I was working through the physics curriculum working through problem sets, tests about the physical universe, I was gradually and continually slipping away from what had centered my interest in physics. I began 

I was finding what all people find when they willingly step into straight-jackets, you either lose your mind—the face growing to fit the mask—or you lose the will to struggle against it. It felt like I was doing a little bit of both, my energy and interest decaying day by day as my mind was still entertaining grand delusions about becoming a physicist. And I was also growing to fit the dictates of environment, beginning to see physics as a transactional exercise in which I was slated to prove to authority figures that I could solve problems that I didn't have any interest in. The ironies of education is that one of the fields in which I had no interest is now my primary field of research, the things you fail to appreciate in youth become the things which seem so crucially important when you're older. 

By the time I was ready to graduate I wanted nothing to do with physics. But I had spent the past four years, and even two years before that preparing to become a physicist, and my identity was so tied to the achievement of this goal, the realization of this professional dream that I could see nothing else. After graduating I retreated home to New Orleans to see if I could find again what I enjoyed about physics. I tutored at my former high school, feeling like a prodigal son who left with dreams of wealth and renown, only to return in disgrace. I flailed and struggled. Applied to Space X. To Shmoop. To Education textbook companies. All didn't work out. So I decided to try to lay out for myself what I wanted from physics, what I needed to do to become a physicist. After a year of this. I was not any clearer on these questions. I was still confused about what physics should be, either the problem-question tit-for-tat I had encountered at MIT or something more expansive something which could connect to an individual's sense of what is beautiful in the world. But my time was up. I had said I would defer my Harvard admission for a year and now that the year was over I had to return.

What we claim to reject
Today black people claim they cannot be racist because they define racism as a system of social and economic advantages that privileges one demographic group over another. In this way racism is disconnected from the actions of an individual and framed as society-wide frameworks that devalue certain identities and overvalue others. But if this is the definition one would use for racism, connecting it to a system rather than an individual's actions, what does it matter whether the individual is black or white? By this definition only societies can be racist, not people. 

This is how black people rebut claims that they are racist. But these rebuttals respond to the explicit claim while ignoring its underlying spirit. The spirit of the claim that black people can be racist is, in better language, that black people can be racially prejudiced even if that prejudice does not have, due to asymmetries in power, the consequences white people's racial prejudices have had. 

But even ignoring the spirit of the claim, the rebuttal itself is wrong. Sure you can define racism as a system of advantages for white people and you can use this definition to wriggle out of the idea that you need to be as racially sensitive to white people as they must be to you, but doing so fails to acknowledge that systems and societies are composed of people and even if what these people do in their daily lives can be defined-out of the scope of racism, it does not in turn imply that what they do does not contribute to the larger racist project of the society they live in. And this applies just as well to black people as it does to white people. Black people have contributed to racism (as it is modernly defined) throughout history and still do today. Being black does not automatically put you in a higher moral frame simply because the consequences of anti-black racism are felt by other people who look like you. Racism must be fought just as well by the people it marginalizes as by the people it privileges. 

In the essay "Intellect in an Intellectual Space" I discuss the ways I internalized racist ideas about black people and intelligence and the process I went through to excise these ideas. There is one paragraph that reflects the main idea of a section concerning liberals (of which I consider myself) and racism: 

Today, everyone knows what it means to be labeled a racist even though few people are sure what exactly racism means. The result of this half-knowledge is that we now have a society in which clearly racist people can say with complete seriousness that they are not racist. Liberals rightly see such people as deluded, but much less is said about liberals' own delusions, the way we lie to ourselves in order to maintain guises of moral superiority while continuing to support, if only passively, ideologies we claim to reject.

At the supermarket today, I was looking for batteries and trying to find a clerk to help me. In an empty shopping aisle, I saw a young black man in a black hooded sweatshirt and a blue shirt underneath. He didn't have any shopping baskets near him, and he was rummaging through shelves of juice in a way that made me think he was taking some sort of stock. "Excuse me," I started. "Do you sell batteries here?" He arched his eyebrows in mild surprise and in his eyes I registered no animosity, just simple curiousness. "Oh, I don't work here." My own eyes grew in astonishment of what I had just done. "Damn, I'm sorry," I said. "It's OK," he replied. I didn't think it was OK. "My bad," I apologized again. "It's OK. It's fine," he said. I was about to apologize again, but I thought better of it. No number of apologies could wash away the shame and hypocrisy I felt. I had always known on an intellectual level that I was racist in ways similar to the very people I judged, but had never had to confront my own racism so explicitly before. 

Years ago at MIT, Patrick and I went to Costco to buy house supplies for Nu Delta. We were walking in a wide aisle, Patrick pushing the cart and jumping on the bottom rung to glide freely for a few seconds. A man, white and middle-aged, came up to us and asked where something in the store was. We told him we didn't work here and waited until he had retreated to another aisle before we started shaking our heads. I had always harbored, almost even cherished, that story as evidence of the prejudices of the society I lived in. It seems that now I have another story that implicates me in that very prejudice. If I am to be intellectually consistent I should cherish both, seeing them as two sides of the same gestalt. One side painting me as a victim, the other side painting me as a perpetrator in the story of racism in America. Neither side, on its own, well reflects the truth of the story, but together they seem to tell contradictory tales about power and its consequences. Still, there is truth in this contradiction, a truth that either sode of the dichotomy avoids, an avoidance that feels safe and right but is actually quite dangerous. For it is only by trying to see the whole picture and acknowledging the truth in the contradiction that we can ever hope to move beyond either side of it.

Hard Lessons in Hard Sciences
I have spent the past weeks reading essays, papers, and books on the sociology and economics of science. Paula Stephan's How Economics Shapes Science is a really excellent account of how changes in funding for science over the 20th century has led to the current academic hierarchies and research practices. Daily science is a bigger enterprise than it was 50 years ago. In biological research it is common to see prestigious labs with 30 individuals (composed of lab technicians, post-docs, and graduate students) working underneath the PI. It requires a lot of money to support these individuals, more money than a university could supply to all of its PIs with similar research group structures. So the PI has to apply for external funding from a government agency like the NSF.

But it would be inaccurate and somewhat historically backwards to state that PIs must apply for grant funding because they have so many students and junior scientists to support. Rather PIs take on students and junior scientists in order to fulfill research directions that the grant pays for. What determines these research directions? I'm not entirely sure. But certainly something that encourages PIs to pursue research projects which result in a large amount of grant money is that universities greatly value the overhead provided from these grants. A cynical explanation: Universities value researchers who bring in large grants because the universities get a cut of the grant money the researchers receive. To fulfill the vision of these grants the researchers must take on capable and willing students and post-docs to complete the daily work of research. This leads to universities being filled with many graduate students and post-docs working to fulfill the research vision of the lead scientist, and this is all primarily because the university is seeking researchers who can bring in the grant money to support the university itself. 

I should review the history that Stephan discusses to see if this explanation is consistent with it. But outside of this explanation there is the undoubtable fact that graduate students (and to a lesser extent post-docs) are taken on by a professor or principal investigator in order to execute the research vision of that investigator. This is especially the case when the investigator has a research grant which pays the student. In this situation the student has to work on the project that falls under the purview of the grant, and of course this is a project that is more in line with the investigator's interest. This seems obvious in retrospect, but I remember being somewhat surprised when Eugene mentioned he couldn't pay me because I wasn't working on one of the projects under his grant. I can't remember how this point came up, since I had by then decided I did not want to be paid by my research advisor, but I remember thinking "Ahh. Of course it is this way." It took much longer for me to realize the career implications of this bargain that so many graduate students willingly step into, and the perhaps more severe implications for those who chose another way. 

Research assistantships are more prestigious that teaching assistantships partly because of the higher value accorded to research over teaching in research oriented universities. But the cost of this prestige is that you are required to spend much of your time doing the work your PI tells you to do, not necessarily because the PI is authoritarian (although he or she might be), but because you are being paid by a research grant which presumes you will be working on the project stated in the grant application. There are often time-tables and deliverables associated with these projects, so it is somewhat like you're a worker-for-hire. 

Before I came to Harvard I remember looking through the Ph. D dissertations of recent graduates and being both dismayed and confused by the fact that they all seemed to concern sub-areas of their principal advisor's research. This similarity led to all students under a research advisor having by title alone very similar research projects, so similar that after a while one could easily determine the advisor from the thesis title alone. This concerned me because my last years at MIT were spent slowly realizing that I was not interested enough in any professor's research to spend six-odd years of my life working through the implications of one of his ideas. Of course, I didn't then have any ideas of my own that I could work on, but I at least had some sense of what I didn't want to work on. 

Now having been at Harvard for several years, I realize that what I intuited in those thesis titles was a somewhat banal truth of graduate education. A graduate student's research work (at least from what I can tell in the Chemistry and Physics departments) consists primarily of projects assigned by the principal investigator. There are at least three reasons for this. One is that students enter into their graduate education largely unprepared to study a research field on their own and develop research projects for themselves. They are unprepared to do this because their undergraduate education did not train them to do this, but instead trained them to solve well-defined problems articulated by other people. Two, students eventually seek research assistantships to free them from teaching duties, and if an advisor is paying a student with a research grant, then the student has to work on the grant's associated project, i.e., within the advisor's research area. The types of projects researchers use for their grants do not change substantially from grant to grant, so if there are one or two grants supporting half a dozen graduate students over the course of a decade then of course the projects of those graduate students would be similar. Third, advisors often only feel qualified in advising a student if the student is working on something within their field of work, but this reason cannot be cleanly separated from the second reason. 

I was thinking about theoretical physics when coming up with this list, but I imagine it is even more extreme in experimental physics or other experimental sciences. In those cases, the research work is so time-intensive and physically laborious that the principal investigator cannot do it on his or her own, and thus they need a group of graduate students to do the brunt of the work for them. In this way, they would only select graduate students willing to do such work and it is these graduate students who ultimately complete their degree.

These days there are a large number of science PhDs going into data science. Before I had known more about graduate education, I initially thought such a transition would be strange for PhD students, moving from being an independent researcher who posed and answered questions of personal interest to essentially an analyst who answered questions posed by other people. But in truth, PhD students are not independent researchers. They exist within hierarchies of power and status in which their work is largely dictated by their doctoral advisor, and it is this structure of graduate education which makes a PhD such good training for work as a data scientist. Being able to faithfully and with great technical competency explore questions or frameworks posed by other people, and to so embody the framework that you begin implementing it unconsciously while believing that it is your own. 

The role of graduate students in academia shows that academia is pyramid scheme by any reasonable definition of the phrase. Something I wrote two years ago, before I knew more about the details of this structure, is weirdly on point. 

It is a pyramid scheme of identity development: You make a deal to convince authority figures of your worth to them now, all the while deferring for months and years to cultivate in yourself anything personally affecting, and they, who are themselves making the same deal, implicitly promise to keep you on the path which leads ultimately to all the external trappings of a life well lived…. 

Individuals in the pyramid scheme always believe they can use the structure of the scheme to achieve their individual goals, never realizing that by buying into the structure and operating within it, they are instead being used by the structure to achieve the goals of those higher in the structure, and more generally, of whoever devised it.

When I wrote this I was mostly concerned with students' inability to develop their own research identity since they were so busy fulfilling the research vision of their professor. But more practically, there are economic problems in this structure. If students spent time and money investing in something that their bosses and institutions claim would provide dividends and then these students discover as they progress that the dividends are constantly pushed beyond the horizon, then the students, who are now post-docs or professors, had certainly been used by a structure which had no regard for them in the first place. 


Last year and the year before, I voted for the formation of a graduate student union at Harvard. I didn't not know anything about the history of graduate student unions and I was not particularly attached to the child-care and dental insurance issues that motivated some other students. But I knew that Harvard professors wielded a large amount of power over their students, and I was all for a measure which would reduce that power. But now having learned about the sociology of science, the hierarchies which ask graduate students to commit to the fulfillment of other people's research visions in the hope that they can fulfill their own visions later one, the usury and the abuse, I see the great import of such a union and also the shadow of its ultimate inefficacy. What really could graduate students lobby for that would reduce their exploitation at the hands of more powerful faculty? I know (admittedly by rumor alone) of some professors who require their graduate students to work throughout weekends and a set amount of hours each week? Would the union really be able to force such professors to limit such working conditions? How quickly would it take these professors to start making noises about the free pursuit of science and their student's personal desire to work this hard? 

I don't know, but having a union which can conceivably wage such battles is better than not having one at all.

Some questions I need to get clearer answers for from Stephan's book: 

Why are grants so important in science research today? Why not get paid by the university?

Meta Writing Intellect in an Intellectual Space
One does not fall in love one day, and then on some other wake up and find that love is gone. Rather on that fateful day you recognize that love is gone because it had been slipping away for months or years, and you are only now realizing it. The process of reclaiming love is similarly slow, but not at all as passive. It requires effort and focus and time in amounts difficult to anticipate, all for the simple goal of mending bridges that have fallen into disrepair more often due to neglect than to fire.

I was a third of my way into my physics Ph. D before I began to see physics again, before I began to feel what I had previously felt when I learned the subject. The anticipation of new knowledge, the quickening of the heart and mind when confronted with a question that is understandable but not completely understood. To find again this perspective on physics and to renew my perspective on myself I had to leave the subject, had to go somewhere else for a time and find an identity that made no reference to physics. 

Baldwin was a conduit to this new place, and reading his work proved to me that I had nothing more to prove to others. By then, narratives of diligence and effort, narratives I had held sacred like a holy shield to protect me from demons both internal and external, revealed themselves to be the cages they always were. In these stories, one worked hard not because some other thing was valuable but because one needed to show others that the worker had value. I was working to escape these cages but I knew outside of them did not exist absolute freedom. Instead, outside the first bars I knew I would find new ones, hemming me in for reasons I had yet to discover. But still the cages had to be escaped if I was ever to grow beyond what I once was. 

(***)

Finding an advisor is a courtship process with the standard stages of innocuous flirtations coming before repeated meetings and finally declared commitment. I had failed in this courtship, and decided to stop engaging with it. I looked through research works of professors at Harvard and I found myself imagining a cycle similar to that I  experienced with my first advisor. He would propose a project. I would work on it with the goal of impressing him, and not because I was actually interested in the work. This confluence of poor motivations and insecurity would be reflected in my quality of work and then I would be fired again. 

It was a road I had known and I didn't want to walk it again. So I tried to envision a different starting point, one that would end somewhere better. After I read Baldwin, I spent winter break working through a calculation I had partially completed months before. The calculation was an extension to a problem from a computational methods class, and even after the class, during the still moments walking home or eating lunch, my mind returned to it as though it was a watch I left behind on a train. When winter break came, I had enough additional time to focus more effort on it. I began asking myself questions about the problem, began seeking ways to extend it beyond its original framework. There were dead ends, false leads. At one point I sat at my window in the suburbs west of Boston and wondered whether I was destroying my academic career. But all other paths had been closed off. This was the path that I was resigned to and the path to which I had to be committed. Winter break ended and the project still remained incomplete. I continued on and on throughout the semester. When spring break came I wrote up my random results in a document, and sent it out to professors in the Harvard community. Many of them directed me to one particular person. The person who read my work and talked to me about it and eventually became my advisor. 

The way all systems work is that they work on people, molding their desires and their goals in ways to fit with the constraints of the system itself. This feature is shared by even the most liberal of systems, and academia is no exception. There is a way that things are done in academia, ready-made paths for people who enter the system and who desire to succeed within it. I could not accept this path, although many of my peers could. There was and will be a cost to my unwillingness to accept it, and it is a cost which is the mirror image of the bargain I had accepted as an undergraduate. But in this cost there is truth, at least of a personal kind, and upon this truth one can create a foundation for selfhood that makes little reference to one's ability to succeed according to the dictates of the systems in which one finds oneself. 

Anyone who makes it far enough in academia, got to be where he or she is by playing according to someone else's set of rules, by jumping through the fire-crested hoops standing in the way of whatever goal they claimed was valuable. Eventually you get tired of jumping and instead of landing safely on the other side you fall and catch fire and burn and burn. And the burning can destroy you, sure enough. But it is also possible that it can clear away what was unnecessary and foster the conditions for new growth. This possibility contains everything that you once thought you needed, everything that had previously been the mirage of a mountain far beyond the hoops. And sometimes from the ashes of a previous identity, a new one shoots forth and what you had believed to be a peak is revealed to stand modest and unremarkable in the shadow of what you can now become.

Academia and Incentives

Until reading Stephan's book, I don't think I ever really understood why R1 universities privileged research over teaching. On some level I thought it was just an issue of differing values: Liberal arts colleges (specifically those without a large research wing) want professors who are good teachers because these colleges primarily want their students to have positive educational experiences. Research colleges on the other hand want professors who are good researchers because they primarily want to be on the cutting edge of scientific development. However, there appears to be monetary incentives involved. Research alone is not privileged at R1 universities, rather research that can bring in large grants which have proportionally large overhead that can be given over to the university. In this way, the coin of the realm for academic science is not publications, but literal coins in the form of university-directed funds from grants. 


Money is certainly less noble of a motivation than "contributing to science" but it is one that is concrete enough to be quantifiable and hence understandable through economics. One of Stephan's ideas is that the current structure of funding of science has led to universities existing as quasi-shopping malls which lease space (i.e., lab-space) to vendors (i.e., scientists) who are allowed to stay as long as they can bring in enough money (i.e., grants) into the shopping mall. One could claim that this metaphor does not apply because in actual shopping malls, vendors pay the larger mall to occupy their space while the universities are paying the researcher. But universities pay the scientist only for their teaching which, for R1 universities, is not the determining factor in whether a scientist receives tenure. Instead the determining factor is the quality of the scientist's research or as proxy for quality, the grant dollars the researcher brings in. 

Here is the description in Stephan's words: 

In many ways universities in the United States behave as though they are high-end shopping malls. they are in the business of building state-of-the art facilities and reputation that attracts good students, good faculty, and resources. they turn around and lease the facilities to faculty in the form of indirect costs on grants and the buyout of salary. In many instances faculty "pay" for the opportunity of working at the university, receiving no guarantee of income if they fail to bring in a grant. To help faculty establish their labs—their space in the mall—universities provide faculty start-up packages. After three years, faculty are on their own to get the funding to stay in the business. 

Faculty use the space and equipment to create research programs, staffing them with graduate students and postdocs who contribute to the research enterprise through their labor and fresh ideas. The incentives are to get bigger and bigger, employing more graduate students and postdocs, which in turn result in more publications, more funding and more degrees awarded.

*Some terminology: "indirect costs on grants" refers to the percentage that the university keeps in the grants that a researcher brings in, "buyout of salary" refers to researchers who use part of their grant money as their own salary so that the university does not have to pay them to teach. The researchers (or perhaps the federal govt?) is then paying the researcher to do the research that brings in more research dollars. 

I wonder, are grant dollars a good proxy for research quality? Because I am cynical and I am a graduate student with neither power nor external funding, I am led to say no, but who could really judge what research quality is anyway? The consensus agrees with me that the answer is no, but there are at least a few cases in which well-funded researchers have done good quality science. I am thinking of the researchers at Berkeley who developed the CRISPR-Cas9 mechanism for gene-editing (I am making an assumption here. I really should look into how (or whether) that work was funded by a grant). But again the existence of exceptions does not imply that general trends do not exist. 

One of Stephan's claims is that the way research is funded and evaluated, namely taking grant dollars as a proxy for research quality, actually degrades research quality. She argues, as do Sydney Brenner and Stephan Quake in other articles, that in an attempt to secure reliable funding researchers choose modest projects which are marginal extensions on the work they have done before rather than pursuing more transformative ideas. I don't like the buzzphrase "transformative ideas" particularly because it is not always clear what ideas are transformative before you start working on them, but I suppose the point is that it is clear what ideas are not transformative and researchers are spending most of their time pursuing those ideas. 

Let's push this metaphor a bit further. The scientist is in the mall and he needs to bring in a profit in order to stay on. In order to do so he needs to staff his enterprise with people who will do the daily work necessary to bring in all this new money. These people are graduate students and post-docs. The model of having employees working for a more senior individual is acceptable in actual malls because one considers the employee and the senior individual as engaging in a sort of monetary transaction in which labor is traded for income. However, the problems with mapping this structure onto graduate students and post docs is the structure surrounding the trade in the first case and the implicit expectations in the second case. 

Under the direction of a principal investigator, graduate students do a lot of the detailed work of modern science, however graduate students are not only laborers. They are students and the ostensibly begin Ph.D programs to learn how to become, hopefully independent, researchers. One of the claims made by PIs is that a student learns how to become an independent researcher by doing the researcher that the PI tells him or her to do. This is the "apprenticeship" model of academic science, but given what most graduate students are doing in the years after their PhD this model seems to be founded on a lie. Most graduate students do not become independent researchers (i.e., researchers with their own lab governed by their own research vision), rather many leave academia for industry and those who don't remain in post-docs or other roles where they support other professor's research.

This is where the problem of "implicit expectations" comes in. In academic science today, students almost always go on to post-docs after they finish graduate school. Given that during graduate school, they spent much of their time working on their PIs ideas, the goal of a post-doc is for these former students to develop into independent researchers. However these post-docs often work under and are paid by PIs who require them contribute to certain projects. Ultimately if these post-docs succeed and have a number of publications with their PIs, it is not clear if they have really achieved independence because through what Merton terms "The Matthew Effect" the work appears to have primarily been directed by the PI. So although the implicit expectation is that post-docs are a way to foster scientific independence, they often exist as another phase of scientific dependency. 

So apart from the idealistic claims of administrators and PIs, in practice graduate school mostly advantages the research agendas of established scientists rather than providing PhD students a reliable route to pursue their own research agendas in the future.

History, Power, Exploitation
History tells you how power works, how hierarchies work, how exploitation and its defenders work. The history of many people in America is one in which they labored diligently and continuously, and still came up short because they failed to recognize that the larger structure in which they had worked had, long before they were a part of it, made no place for them. Knowing something about this history has made me distrustful of institutions, wary to the point of paranoia. You think that playing by some larger set of rules created by people who do not know or care about you, will save you and yet you are surprised when you are not saved? Maybe you should have interrogated the rules themselves rather than constantly disparaging your inability to play by them? Because the truth is that systems never make room for people. People make room for systems. Contorting or simply shaving off corners to fit in places they more naturally might never have been. This is the standard route. But there is another. Recognizing that you do not fit, you have come upon a half-truth more dangerous than ignorance alone. Because this half-truth exists as a precipice beneath which there are waves and rocks and sharks. And you navigate the precipice knowing that on the either side that if you will ever find a place it will have to be one you create yourself.

I am confused about faculty course buyouts, in particular about how the incentives play out for the professors and the university. 

I will use a constructed example to frame my confusion. As a disclaimer, I just learned that buy-outs exist in academia, so I am quite ignorant about how they work. Please let me know if my example is unrealistic. 


Say that a university pays an assistant professor $100,000 for his teaching during the academic year. He has received an external grant of $500,000 of which $150,000 goes to the university as overhead. The professor wants to lessen his teaching load, and he can do so by paying the university a part of his salary, also known as "buying-out". His university charges 20% of his full-year salary for each course he buys out. So he has to pay the university $20,000 to avoid teaching that one course. The university then hires a non-tenure track faculty or a graduate student to teach this course for $10,000. 

I am confused about how the incentives work here. The university has received $150,000 from overhead, paid $100,000 as a salary, received $20,000 for a course buyout, and then paid $10,000 for someone else to teach the course. So the university has received $60,000 from this transaction. Doesn't this transaction greatly benefit the university. Ostensibly it also benefits the professor who gets to do research in the time saved from teaching, but if this research has the potential to bring in more grant dollars and hence more overhead to the university, isn't the ultimate benefit still to the university? 

Is this how the process sometimes works? If so, are they encouraged by departments/administrators? How often are course-buyouts used by professors?

tl;dr: Course-buyouts can give junior professors more time to do research, and I know that it is in their professional interest to spend most of their time on research. But it seems that at the end of the process, it is mostly administrators and the university that is advantaged, almost as if the researcher is giving the university money so that he or she can do the research which will bring yet again more money into the university. 



It is in the researcher's If so, are buyouts typically encouraged? 



The external grant has brought $150,000 into the university. He is paid $100,000 for the typical academic year, but to avoid teaching a course he returns $20,000. The university then pays someone else $10,000 And to buy-out of his course he gives the university an additional $20,000. Now, the university pays the professor $100,000

The university typically pays the professor $100,000 to teach for the year, but because of the external grant the university does not need to use its own funds to pay the professor; instead the professor (or the larger federal body) is in essence paying the professor. So from the professor's grant, the university saves/earns $100,000. Additionally, if the professor does not want to teach a course, he has to return some of this salary (that the university was not itself providing him anyway) back to the university through a buyout. So the university gets an extra $20,000. Now, the university hires a replacement to teach the course for $10,000. In all the university has received $100,000+$20,000-$10,000 = $110,000 from this transaction and this is not even including the overhead it gets from the grant. 

Doesn't this transaction greatly benefit the university? It appears that it also benefits the professor who gets to do research in the time saved from teaching, but if this research has the potential to bring in more grant dollars and hence more overhead to the university, isn't the ultimate benefit still to the university?

Editing-Lessons for Self-Assembly of a Dimer System

Last week I edited and submitted the final version of "Self-assembly of a dimer system" to the Physical Review. The submission marked the end of a two and a half months of editing beyond what I thought I would have to do. After I completed MITES at the beginning of August, I expected to be able to submit the paper by the middle of September or latest by the end of October. I expected this because I thought I had most of the results for the work. But I was wrong on multiple accounts. For some reason I though that having completed the analytical work, the application to  biomolecular systems would be straightforward and I would be able to easily write up and understand what the model predicted for ssDNA-ssDNA interactions, TF-DNA interactions, and protein-protein interactions. When I started this portion of the work in the middle of August, I think I estimated that it would take about two weeks to complete. Instead it took me a month and a half to complete what I had intended, and even after that period, I later realized that much of the work was incomplete. 

There are leagues of difference between what I considered a final draft at the start of October and what I ultimately submitted to the Physical Review last week. My introduction explicitly states the main results and better contextualizes the paper in the existing literature. The mathematical argument for the existence of the fully-correct assembly phase is tighter. Instead of a 15 page appendix there is a supplementary materials section that only the most interested of readers will be subjected to. The final discussion is better organized into sections that state the interpretation and limitations of the result. In so many ways the paper is superior to what it would have been had I tried to quickly submit it at the beginning of October. This experience reminds me of a Junot Diaz quote: "The world is telling you to rush while the art is telling you to take your time. Always listen to the art."

Let me be explicit about the things that changed in the two and a half months that passed between the two final versions of the paper: 

1.) Definition of Fully-Correct Assembly: I previously defined the regime of "fully-correct assembly" as one where  and  satisfy . After I gave the paper to Rostam to read, he mentioned that this regime was not really "fully-correct assembly" since the two quantities were not equal to . I countered that if both  and  were set to  then there would be a divergence in the equations, and that my given condition was the next best thing to setting both equal to . Rostam wasn't convinced so I tried to think of a better way to frame the argument. Upon re-analyzing my discussion I realized that the equilibrium equations could not actually satisfy ; this was an impossible condition for the system. I am not completely sure how I missed this before, but it might have been because I used different approximations for each equilibrium equation without realizing that I was doing so.

Recognizing this inconsistency, I spent a week or so trying to rectify, and eventually realized that the correct condition was simply to set  and use the equilibrium equations to determine at what value these equations were equal. Ultimately I found that   and  equaled a value between  and , and that the condition  led to an equation for a critical temperature .

2. ) Existence of Critical Temperature: In my previous analysis, I found that the equilibrium equations satisfied the "fully-correct assembly" condition  at two different temperatures that I termed  and . After recognizing that the condition  was actually an impossible condition and then finding the true "fully-correct assembly" condition , I had to completely change this analysis. I should have expected that something was wrong with my previous analysis, since even though  or  ostensibly represented the temperature at which both  and  were approximately , my simulations and solution plots showed that  and  defined the critical temperature for only certain parameter regimes. It was almost as if  and  were only approximating the true critical temperature and this approximation was sometimes invalid. 

I later confirmed this. Beginning with the fully-correct assembly condition , I found that this condition was true at a critical temperature  that satisfied a self-consistency equation. Analyzing this equation in certain limits, I realized that what I had previously termed  and  were not true critical temperatures but approximations of the true critical temperature  for large  and large , respectively. 

3) Type I and Type II Categorization: My categorization of the system as Type I or Type II was based on my belief that  and  represented true critical temperatures. Given that this was shown to  not be the case I had to find another definition. I knew that  and  did approximate the critical temperature for certain parameter regimes, and these parameter regimes were definitely associated with qualitatively different solution plots, so my previous analysis was not entirely flawed. However, I had previously considered the Type I and Type II labels as precise labels of the dimer system. What the calculation of  revealed was that they were approximate labels which were only unambiguous for parameter regimes in which  could be approximated by  or . So I defined a system as Type I if  and as Type II if . This approximate definition may feel less conceptually satisfying than my previous explicit one, but it is more accurate to the reality of the system. Moreover, when beginning from the self-consistency equation for  , the interpretation of  as being derived from the  equilibrium condition and of  as being derived from the  equilibrium condition is no longer true. Thus I relabeled  as  and  as . 

4) Parameter Space Plots: After correcting my definition of the fully-correct assembly regime, introducing the definition of a critical temperature, and re-interpreting  and  (previously known as " and ") as approximations, I realized that I needed to change my parameter space plots. These plots began from the assumption that  and  precisely defined the critical temperature of the system and the plots also were my best guess interpretations of qualitative trends in the solution plots. When I realized the assumption was wrong I began to question my interpretations as well. Reconsidering the qualitative trends in the solution plots, it became clear that my labels were wrong as was my method of determining the boundary lines for the phases. In fact, there were really no phase boundaries, just crossover boundaries and the definition of these boundaries had to be obtained from the equilibrium equations rather than from the critical temperature conditions. After realizing my error, I spent a long time generating contour plots and then ultimately line plots characterizing "regimes" (not "phases") of parameter space both in  space and in  space. 

The difference between the parameter space plots in the October version of the paper and the one I ultimately submitted is much like the difference between the parameter space plot in the documents I sent to professors in 2016 and the plot that ultimately appeared in the paper. In both cases the initial plot was based on approximations that were found either to be inapplicable or less general than I presumed. And in both cases the final plot looks aesthetically much better than the initial one. 

5) Simulation Plots: Rostam had two very helpful comments/criticisms about the simulation results in the paper. First he wondered why the simulation results in the Type II system were so different from the analytical results. And second he wondered why I had made the simulation time and averaging choices I made. These two comments ended up being related. I chose a simulation time (I think of about 10,000 steps) based on what I believed to be the shortest run time to get good simulation results. And I averaged the last 100 or so steps of a simulation because I thought that was a good representation of a thermodynamic ensemble. However, the simulation time was actually too short for the Type II system to reach equilibrium, even after I included the unphysical dimer-cross over transition, and computing the average from a single simulation resulted in too noisy of a result. So I extended my simulation time to 30,000 steps and rather than computing the average from a single simulation for each, I ran 50 simulations computed the average of each simulation and then the average of the averages and took that to represent my point. The resulting simulations were much longer but the results were also much cleaner. 

6) Biomolecules section: Another of Rostam's criticisms was the biomolecule section. He thought all of the sections except the ssDNA section were somewhat specious. He especially disagreed with the categorization of TF-DNA systems as Type I since it is known that TF spends most of its time bound non-specifically to DNA. Even for the ssDNA section, he wondered how I found the binding energy parameters I cited and asked me if I had calculated it by generating all possible ssDNA sequences. 

Like all of Rostam's criticism, I used his criticisms of these various parts to take a second look at my analysis and arguments. I ultimately agreed that the arguments (or even the main points) of the TF-DNA and protein-protein interaction sections could be improved, and I discovered that much of the ssDNA-ssDNA section was actually based on an incorrect approximation. Overall the entire Biomolecules section was quite bad. 

The section ended up going through many iterations. In one iteration, I tried to predict the temperatures  and  for each model system. In another iteration—after I had corrected my incorrect definitions of System Type—I tried to use derived inequalities to categorize the system as Type I or Type II. At one point I realized that I was wrongly using biophysical data on free-energy parameters as my energy parameters, and, being unable to think of a way out of this misuse, I considered scrapping the section altogether. Eventually, I found a way to frame this section in a much cleaner and consistent way, with the same question (Type I or Type II?) being asked of each model biomolecule system and answered using tentative but more reasonable assumptions. I also had to create a new notebook where I implemented Rostam's quasi-suggestion of computing the possible sequences of ssDNA and finding the corresponding association free energy. 

What section improved the most? It is difficult to say.  I can say that the section that changed the least was the "Simulation Results" section and I think that even for that section the improvement was a significant one. 

What are the takeaway lessons from all these changes? I can think of two main ones and two subsidiary ones. 

Main Lessons

Find someone to provide critical but constructive criticism: My description of the changes I made and what motivated them reveals how helpful it is to have another set of eyes on your work. These second set of eyes are often beholden to a second set of assumptions and values a difference which ultimately help you see what your own eyes cannot. You will always have blindspots and areas in science where you lack expertise, so it is always useful to have someone else look through your work and comment on it.   But especially important is sending the work to some one who you know will take the time to provide careful criticism. I was lucky to have Rostam in this regard.

Leave you work alone for at least a month: What also helped me more critically analyze my work and find all the mistakes I missed was gaining some distance from it by editing it a month after I wrote a final draft. With this distance I was able to see this work as if it had been done by someone else and thus I was less attached or comfortable with arguments I had taken for granted. I am really glad that I did this. It sort of felt like I wasn't getting anywhere when I was making these fixes, but the work improved so much over the past two months. 

Here are the secondary lessons

Be patient; When you publish your work, it's out there forever: I was in somewhat of a rush to publish this work at the start of the semester, but if I had ignored all the problems which seemed to arise anew each week and if I had submitted this paper at the end of September as I had planned, then I would eventually have been deeply embarrassed by the result. When you publish something it, you cannot go back later and make corrections. It exists online and in the record of science ever more. It now seems strange to me that I felt the need to rush a process that led to an essentially irreversible result. But then again had I been not so intent on getting the work ready for publication, I would not have seen or pursued the errors as fervently as I did. Likely a balance needs to be achieved, something between a propulsive desire to do the work but a calming influence to recognize that you should not sacrifice quality for speed. 

Don't get attached to your own arguments: I had to throw away many arguments from my previous version of the paper. This was often quite easy to do because I recognized that these old arguments were wrong and had eventually found better ones. Less easy were the arguments that were not totally wrong but somewhat specious. I am thinking about one change that I made where I introduced "weak" and "strong" Type I conditions for categorizing the system. I thought these conditions were interesting in the way they played with the concepts of "necessary" and "sufficient" but ultimately they made the Biomolecules section too cluttered, and I had to replace them with something simpler, which I ultimately realized was better than the previous conditions.    Relevant to the second main lesson, what was quite helpful in not getting attached to my own arguments was stepping away from the paper for a month so that when I came back to it, the arguments didn't seem like my own but seemed to belong to someone sloppier than me.

Weekly Review
I submitted a draft of the Self-Assembly paper to Physical Review E. My guess is that I will get comments back in March, and it might be published in May. Overall I am happier with the paper now than I was a few months ago. I think it has improved greatly, in a way similar to how the "favorable contact model" improved into the "self-assembly of a dimer system." 

With this paper out of the way, my main current physics project is my dissertation. I will copy my two published papers and my just submitted paper as three body chapters of the dissertation. If I then write an abstract, acknowledgements, an introduction, and a conclusion the dissertation would be complete. As for the title, I was going to call the work "Combinatorics and Biomolecular Interactions," but only the "Self-Assembly of a Dimer System" concerns interacting systems. So I changed it to "Combinatorics and Biomolecules," but even this is incomplete since one of the chapters concerns an exactly soluble model of statistical physics and not combinatorics or biomolecules per se. So the new title was "Combinatorics, Biomolecules, and Statistical Physics," but this title does not reflect the motivational sequence of the ideas in the work. In the dissertation, I am using properties of molecules to develop combinatorial problems which when couched in statistical physics yield results that provide new understanding of the original biomolecular system. So I think the best title is "Biomolecules, Combinatorics, and Statistical Physics." I wonder if this title is too general. 

My goal this week is to add all three papers to the dissertation and to write rough outlines of the Introduction and Conclusion. Someone once told me that the Introduction should be like a review paper, so it will likely be the hardest to write. 

Here is the current outline of the dissertation 


Title: Biomolecules, Combinatorics, and Statistical Physics
1. Introduction
2. Protein Design and the Symmetric Group
3. Permutation Glass
4. Self-assembly of a Dimer System
5. Conclusion

If I were to include all the work that I want to include in my dissertation the outline would be

Title: Biomolecules, Combinatorics, and Statistical Physics

Part I - Constraints and Combinatorics
1. Introduction
2. Protein Design and the Symmetric Group
Part II - Models for Mathematical Physics
4. Permutation Glass
3. Thermally Distributed Derangements
5. Continuum Limit of Thermal Permutations
Part III - Biomolecular Systems
6. Self-assembly of a Dimer System
7. Partitions, Aggregation, and Partition Functions
8. Conclusion


Also, I have a final-final draft for "Old Prices and New Tickets," and I have written blurbs that I am prepared to send to Longreads, New Republic, New Inquiry, and Jacobin Magazines. I was going to send them on Wednesday, but I am now wondering if I should wait until I meet with Suzanne. 

Some other random goals: 
Pygame - It would be nice to learn how to simulate an ideal gas system using pygame. Maybe then I would be able to simulate a system of associating and dissociating monomers. 
Moran and Wright-Fisher Simulations - I've been dragging my feet on creating simulations for the Moran and Wright Fisher Process. I think I will need to simulate these systems before I try to simulate the evolutionary rescue situation Victor described. 
Kimura Problem - I am sooo close to finishing this problem. I just need to work out why the variance is the way it is and work through the special case at the end of one of Kimura's papers. 
Intellect in Intellectual Places - I have a really rough-draft of this essay. I would like to read through it and excise the parts that are unnecessary and try to improve the parts that are necessary. 
Data Science Incubator/Jobs in general - I need to apply to the Insight Data Science Incubator for the summer. I need to also write down the schedule of OCS events for January

A Feeling for the Organism

It might be tempting to read this history as a tale of dedication rewarded after years of neglect—of prejudice or indifference eventually routed by courage and truth. But the actual story is both more complex and more illuminating. It is a story about the nature of scientific knowledge, and of the tangled web of individual and group dynamics that define its growth. 

A new idea, a new conception, is born in the privacy of one man's or one woman's dreams. But for that conception to become part of the body of scientific theory, it must be acknowledged by the society of which the individual is a member. In turn, the collective effort provides the ground out of which new ideas grow. Scientific knowledge as a whole grows out of the interaction—sometimes complex, always subtle—between individual creativity and communal validation. But sometimes that interaction miscarries, and an estrangement occurs between individual and community. Usually, in such a case, the scientist loses credibility. But should that not happen, or, even better, should it happen and then be reversed, we have a special opportunity to understand the meaning of dissent in science. (Preface, xii)

The research field of biophysics has existed since the mid-20th century, and for much of that time its practitioners have viewed physics as a tool that lent quantitative questions and methods to a discipline traditionally more focused on qualitative analysis. These physics-derived questions and methods ultimately proved useful to biology not only because they gave the subject a new vocabulary and technology, but also because they led to important problems and solutions that biologists might not have found on their own. A few examples from this history: Luria and Delbrück used mathematical and probabilistic methods to affirm Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection (Luria's book, Delbruck's paper); Crick, Franklin, and Watson took from physics a reductionist philosophy and X-ray crystallography methods and thereby resolved the sub-cellular structures responsible for genetic inheritance (Watson and Crick bio, Rosalind Bio, Original Paper); Berg and Purcell used electromagnetism and the theory of diffusion to establish limits on how accurately bacteria can determine surrounding food concentrations (Physical limits of chemoreception, Life at Low Reynolds number). 

Due to this history, more traditional physicists have considered biophysics to be a part of applied physics rather than physics proper which is to say that they saw the subject as being concerned with problems less fundamental to our understanding of the physical world than those explored in cosmology, high energy physics, or condensed matter physics. According to this perspective, although one could use an understanding of physics to contribute to problems of biological interest, one could not use problems in biology to contribute to an understanding of physics. One of the purposes of this dissertation is to argue that this view is wrong by showing that there are physics models motivated by biological systems which nevertheless still have properties of interest to physicists. 

To this end the thesis presents two statistical physics models, the first motivated by the role permutations play in computational solutions to the protein-design problem (REPLACE), and the second motivated by the general properties of correctly and incorrectly interacting monomers in protein and DNA systems. Although both models begin from principally biological concerns they ultimately but bear features of interests to physicists. From the first model and its various incarnations, we find multiple phases, multiple transition temperatures, and solvable implications of quenched disorder. From the second model, we find explicit equilibrium conditions defining how a system with many interacting particles can organize into a more ordered configuration.

Both models are "exactly solvable" in Baxter's sense of the phrase (CITATION), that is, for both, the initial sum over states defining the partition function can be reduced to an analytical expression from which observables can be computed. Exactly solvable models are useful in physics because they provide analytically simple frameworks for understanding the properties found in more realistic systems. Thus, another purpose of this dissertation is to study an  unexplored intersection between biomolecular systems and exactly-solved models in statistical physics. 

The key mathematical techniques used to study this intersection are drawn from combinatorics (FIGURE), which, with regard to our model of self-assembly presents clear advantages over the most common approaches to studying biomolecular interactions. The common approach is to represent a system of interacting biomolecules with an effective chemical law, called the law of mass action. This law is then used to model how concentrations can change contingent on changes in temperature and binding free-energy parameters. However, the law employs infinite number and infinite volume assumptions which obscure important finite-number effects. It is only possible to study such effects by beginning from a physical perspective employing microstates and combinatorics and computing partition functions by using the latter to define the former. 

The basic approach we take to building and studying our models is as follows: We begin with a biomolecular system or a problem associated with a biomolecular system. This starting point has properties that can be reduced to well-understood calculations from combinatorics. After relating the problem to combinatorics, we can then use its combinatorial representation to define the microstates of an equilibrium statistical physics system whose exact partition function either provides an interesting mathematical model in of itself, a useful toy model for gaining insight into the motivating biomolecular system, or both. 

The basic approach we take to building and studying our models is as follows: We begin with a biomolecular system or a problem associated with biomolecular systems. The system or problems has properties that can be reduced to well-understood quantities or calculations from combinatorics. After connecting the problem to combinatorics, we then couch use the combinatorial representation to define the microstates of an equilibrium statistical physics model whose exact partition function either provides an interesting mathematical model in of itself or provides a toy model for gaining insight into the motivating biomolecular system.

In this regard the dissertation can be divided into two parts. The first part, starting in Chapter 2, begins by considering a computational solution to the protein design problem problem. Protein design refers to the problem of determining what sequences of amino acids are needed to obtain specific 3D protein structures. In certain computational attempts to solve this problem, one seeks the correct orderings of a particular collection of amino acids, and, motivated by such solutions, we present and analyze the properties of a model whose state space is defined by permutations of an ordered list. In Chapter 2 we analyze the simplest mean-field versions of the model, and in Chapter 3 we study the model in the context of quenched disorder and thereby define what we term a "permutation glass". In both chapters, after introducing the problem, the focus is largely mathematical and the resulting model does not make reference to the protein design motivated that initiated. 

The second part, represented by Chapter 4, also uses a biomolecular system to motivate an exactly solved statistical physics model, but after analyzing the properties of the model, we use our results to develop new ways to understand the motivating system. In this way the model we develop provides physics with am exactly-solved model of a self-organized system and also provides molecular biology with a new way to characterize systems of interacting biomolecules. 

The two parts of the dissertation—mathematical models and biomolecular systems—are united in the way they both use combinatorics to situate and explore their questions of interest, and in the conclusion we use


All of the models in this work, whether they focus on the abstract properties of mathematical models or on what such models suggest about their motivating biomolecular systems, are united in the ways that they use combinatorics to define and explore their questions of interest. In the final chapter, we consider where else this theme might lead by considering additional mathematically or biologically motivated problems in which combinatorics can be used to define the state space and serve as a foundation for a new statistical physics model.

 Also, both systems exhibit properties traditionally found in models derived from condensed matter systems: Under various conditions, the first model exhibits multiple phases, multiple transition temperatures, and quenched disorder, and the second model provides considers the thermodynamics of monomers assembling into more ordered configurations.

Another purpose of this dissertation is to study
This dissertation is not primarily concerned with the solution to a central problem in biology or in physics but with studying an unexplored intersection between biomolecular systems and exactly-solved models in statistical physics. The key mathematical techniques used to highlight this intersection are taken from combinatorics (FIGURE) and as such depart from the continuous field-theoretic methods typical of theoretical physics analyses of biological systems. The typical methods are found in soft-condensed matter physics (CITATION) and are often concerned with questions of length-scale and correlations. However, in this work we are focused on questions of configurations and discretely defined order, thus making combinatorics a more appropriate framework. 

Moreover, with regard to our model of self-assembly, combinatorics presents advantages over the most common approach to studying systems of biomolecular interactions. The common approach is to represent a system of interacting biomolecules with the law of mass action (CITATION) and to then use this law to model how concentrations can change contingent on changes in temperature and binding free energy parameters. Such an approach is sensible from the perspective of an experimental chemist but the infinite number and infinite volume assumptions are too coarse grained for the physicists, especially one for whom finite numbers are important. The physicist would be interested in the specific sources of the free energy, whether the energy comes from binding energies or long-range interactions whether entropy can be decomposed into translation or rotational contributions, and how numbers of particles—not simply concentrations—constrain system thermodynamics. Consequently, to study systems of biomolecular interactions from a physical perspective requires one to begin from a more foundational perspective in terms of microstates and partition functions.

Throughout the short history of biophysics (i.e., mid-20th century to the present), physics has always been seen as a tool that gave biologists a different perspective on their discipline. In this way, biologists saw physics in much the same way that physicists saw mathematics: as a means to a more interesting ends rather than as an ends in of itself. Consequently, traditional physicists have seen biophysics as part of applied physics which is to say they saw biophysics as concerned with problems less fundamental than those explored in high energy physics or condensed matter physics. In this view, although one could use the methods and understanding in physics to contribute to problems in biology, one could not use problems in biology to contribute to an understanding physics. One of the subsidiary purposes of this dissertation is to argue that this view is wrong and to show that there are models motivated by biological systems that have mathematical properties of interest to physicists, and that these models, simple as they are, had not been previously explored because the motivation for them was in a place physicists traditionally did not look. 

(I would argue that this view is not novel. There are many biological problems that physicists have taken an interest in and which can be said to have contributed to the canon of physics.)


Throughout the short history of biophysics, that strange subject existing at the interface between biology and physics, physics was always seen as a tool which gave biologists a different perspective on their domain. In this way biologists saw physics in much the same way that physicists saw mathematics, as means to an epistemically more interesting ends rather than an ends in of itself. Physicists cognizant of this view of the role physics played in biophysics, often relegated biophysics to a domain of applied physics which was less fundamental than areas like solid-state physics or its larger region of condensed matter physics. One purpose of this thesis is to argue that this relegation is a mistake and that there are models motivated by biological systems which can be of interest to physicists, and that these models, simple as they are, have not been explored because the motivation for them existed in the biological domain which physicists either ignored or entered only to see physics in the utilitarian manner described above. 



The use of such models could be taken too far, and become an onanistic enterprise in which the models are sought and studied in of themselves and not because they lend insight to a more fundamental physical situation. But properly motivated and properly interpreted these models can be useful. Typically such models have existed in statistical physics and have been motivated by some situation in a solid-state or condensed matter scenario. The Ising Model is the most famous exactly soluble model in statistical physics (cite: History of Lenz-Ising Model),  but there are others which have followed in its footsteps, including the XY model, the Potts model. Models as they are used and exist in biophysics tend to be qualitative (as in the use of free energy to describe reaction equations) or not explicitly related to biophysics. 

With regard to this latter point, there is an area that is known as biophysics which uses exactly soluble models to understand biological phenomena, however these models do not have anything explicitly to do with biophysics. Evolutionary dynamics since the work of Hardy and Weinberg, leading up to the work of Haldane, Fisher, and Wright, continuing on to the work of Kimura and Keynes has built up mathematical frameworks as elaborate as solid-state physics. Quantitatively or physically inclined biologists do use these models in their work, but they are expressly not biophysics but rather mathematical biology. That is these models seek to study/couch and consider the biological phenomena of evolution in a mathematical framework whose precision allows for a better understanding of evolution. Doing so is good for evolution but it represents sort of a different project from the one physicists might be interested in. To be specific physicists, would be more interested not merely in a mathematical explanation of a phenomena but one which has continuity with the physical explanations that are already accepted in the discipline. Therefore, describing the competition of bacterial colonies in terms of game theory is both biologically and mathematically interesting, but divorced as it is from precisely stated and mathematically framed physical principles that structure and determine that competition, such a study would not be biophysics but would be mathematical biology. 

Why make this semantic distinction? Why separate mathematical biology from a theoretical biology couched in physics when both are using mathematical models to frame and hence better understand biological phenomena. The reason is a philosophical one and extends from my (and perhaps other people's) commitment to a physical understanding of phenomena. If we are to understand the physical basis of life it is necessary to connect what ever we find or state to be that physical basis to the models and phenomena that define the inanimate matter we have better understood. It would be detrimental to this product

If we are to characterize life as a consequence of distinctly physical phenomena and not governable by its own set of rules distinct from those phenomena, then we must seek to understand life and life processes through physics rather than through mathematical frameworks that make no reference to physics. Thus mathematical biology although useful in shedding light on quantitative aspects of biology does not contribute to the larger project of connecting the phenomena of biology to the smaller-scale phenomena of particle interactions that are better understood. Perhaps, this goal of trying to understand biology through physics is foolhardy given the different properties of the important systems that characterize both. There are archetypes in physics and archetypes in biology and the two are sufficiently different to suggest that they are immiscible. In physics, simple models are used which are often frictionless and in vacuum and one uses these models to understand a wider set of phenomena. In biology, model organisms (like E.coli and yeast) are used to understand processes in more complicated organisms. In biology the focus is on precise descriptions of processes that are perhaps connected to but not reducible to a set of ideas like genetic material creating information to make proteins, or mutations leading to evolution. In physics the focus is on principles whose manifestations in various physical situations lead to different properties in those situations. One could say that these two perspectives are incompatible and that the necessary messiness of a biological system, if reduced to one that physics can analyze, would then be rendered irrelevant to biology. 

To escape this point authors sacrifice simplicity for precision, building complicated models that then employ computational methods to make up the gap that analytical methods cannot cross. (I'm thinking about Hodgkin and Huxley's series of pde's for action potentials). But computational results are primarily useful for determining trends and are less so for understanding general features. And the complexity of a model, although providing accuracy, obscures conclusions in a sea of parameters from which general conclusions cannot be found. 

One could seek out a way to avoid these confusions, to conceive of a biophysics that makes use of physics to build simple but realistic analytical models whose solutions could lend more insight into the original biological system that motivated them. Others have tried to do this by borrowing statistical physics models from condensed matter physics and giving them a biological lens (e.g., the Ising model applied to proteins), or by using statistical field theory methods to build continuous models of DNA chains. But why borrow models, when one can create them anew, and why use continuum field theory models with all their associated complications when discrete models are nearby and available? 

The purpose of this work is to bridge a gap in biophysics literature between exactly soluble models in statistical physics and biomolecular systems. The author has found a number of simple statistical physics models that are motivated by biomolecular systems and either have interesting properties in of themselves or have properties that lend insight into the original motivating system. The key mathematical techniques used in this work are taken from combinatorics and analysis and as such represent a departure from the more elaborate field theoretical methods typical of soft-condensed matter physics systems. Indeed the systems of interest in this work do overlap with those considered in soft-condensed matter physics, but rather than using the standard methods to analyze one aspect of their properties we develop other methods couched in particle-based statistical physics to analyze other aspects of their properties. 

The most common approach to studying system of biomolecular interactions is to represent the system with the law of mass action and to try to understand how concentrations change contingent on the temperatures and binding free energies. This approach is sensible from the perspective of an experimental chemist but it is overly coarse-grained and approximate for the physicist, especially one for whom finite numbers are important. The physicist would be interested in the specific sources of the free energy, whether the energy comes from binding energies or long-range interactions whether entropy can be decomposed into translation or rotational contributions. Consequently, studying these systems from a physical perspective requires one to begin from a more foundational and specific point of view, one that can incorporate effects not considered by the chemistry perspective. 

The thesis is largely divided into two sections which include four chapters. In the first section, we motivate a statistical physics model by considering a computational problem/solution in the field of protein design. This statistical physics model is studied in of itself, but we also extend it to a disordered context. This section is largely mathematical and outside of the protein design motivation does not make reference to biology. The next section, we motivate a statistical physics model by considering how biomolecular systems of monomers can form correct or incorrect contacts with one another. This analysis is also quite mathematical but at the end we return to the biological system and try to use our results to say something novel about it. These two frames—mathematical models and biomolecular systems—are united in the way they both use combinatorics to situate and flesh out their questions of interest.

In this thesis we use the combinatorial properties of biomoecular systems to motivate statistical physics models that are either themselves interesting or that provide a new perspective on the motivating biomolecular system. The thesis can be seen as divided into two parts relative to these ends. In the first part we extrapolate a statistical physics system from a computational biomolecule problem and analyze the system for its own mathematical properties. In the second part we again extrapolate a statistical physics system from a biomolecular system, but we use the system to find new ways to describe or analyze the original system.

Two directions
Much of my life it has felt like I was being pulled in two directions. Towards physics. Towards writing. Towards men. Towards women. Towards courage. Towards cowardice. Towards integrity. Towards abnegation. Towards truth. Towards lies. Towards discipline. Towards indolence

As if I was two people trapped in one. I have spent too much time trying to reconcile these opposing identities, to pit one against the other and choose correctly or choose both when possible and possibly better. I haven't been entirely successful, but the marginal success I have obtained has always led me to see something, to be grated a vision impossible to achieve by either identity alone.

Abstract draft
Motivated by the combinatorial properties of the protein design problem and the specific and non-specific interactions in biomolecular systems, we build exactly-solved models for the statistical physics of the symmetric group, permutation glasses, and the self-assembly of dimer systems. The first two models are studied for their statistical physics properties apart from the motivating system, and the third model is used to better understand the constraints of correct dimerization in biomolecular systems. 

These models are exactly-solved in the sense that the sum-over-states defining their partition functions can be reduced to analytically more tractable expressions, and unlike most exactly-solved models in statistical physics, whose motivations stem from condensed matter scenarios, these models arise from abstracting the order-disorder properties of biomolecular systems. This work suggests that there is a class of interesting and unexplored models in statistical physics which arise from the combinatorial properties of biomolecular systems. In the conclusion, we give preliminary suggestions for how to further build and explore the properties of such models. 

investigation suggests their investigation serves as a proof-of-concept suggestion that there is a large class of interesting and unexplored models in statistical physics arising from the study of the combinatorial properties of biomolecular systems.

Weekly Review
I failed to write a weekly review on Sunday or yesterday, but I did manage to complete all of the major tasks in last week's review. I went to NY and submitted my passport application, created the additional figures for the dissertation, and wrote drafts of the introduction and conclusion. The introduction is much more polished than the conclusion, due in part to a depressive spiral I experienced last weekend. However, my hope is to write final versions of both this week. 

I did not include an explicit literature review in the introduction and instead directed the reader to the introductory sections of each chapter. But I am starting to think a general overview of the literature associated with each of the three intersections of the Venn diagram are appropriate. Something that considers the literature on exactly solved models and biomolecules, exactly solved models and combinatorics, and then combinatorics and biomolecules. I initially thought that constructing such a review would be a slog, but with this framing it seems more interesting. Still I'll leave it for later. 

This week there are a few things I'd like to accomplish
# Read and edit Eugene's poem
# Print out Yue's paper
# Add introduction to dissertation draft
# Create sections for literature review topics 
# Write final draft of the conclusion 
# Read and edit one page of Intellect in an Intellectual Space
# Download Pygame; Run at least one simulation 
# Write notes on
	- Algebraic solution to fixation in Moran process
	- Gillespie evolution and saturation
	- Kimura and Mutations 
# Write personal notes paragraph: Tues, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat

# Data science Google and Insight; applications and due dates
# OCS resources 
# Draft email to Victor Kostyuk email
# Roombook: Monday January 14th
# APS conference registration 

Hi Jacob, 

I hope your new year is going well! 

I have a potential issue with my advisor. It's currently not a huge problem, but I can imagine it being an issue in the coming months if not later. Just to check confidentiality: As Director of Graduate Studies for Science, are you required to report any potential student/advisor issues to someone else? I am looking mostly for contingency plans on an authorship question and not trying to report an issue. 

Best,
Mobolaji

Notes to Self about authorship
I have been obsessed recently with issues of authorship and attribution. More so this week given what has transpired between Eugene and I. After I sent him a notice about my thesis and the fact that I submitted the "Self-Assembly of a Dimer System" paper for review he said that he would like the work to be a joint collaboration, which is to say that he wanted to be a co-author. His main reason was that the work fits in with the "theme" of the lab and I was thus "clearly" influenced by the lab's work in coming up with the direction for the project. He also said that having a senior coauthor on publication would not hurt my future career prospects, something I know is not true. In response, I told him that I did not feel comfortable including a second author on a publication in which I developed the framing idea, devised and implemented the analysis, and wrote the entire text, supplementary materials and code, but that I included him and everyone else I spoke to in the lab in the acknowledgments section. After my response, he changed tack and said that the offer was primarily to help me. He said he had 400+ publications and was not particularly interested in adding an additional publication ("even" in his words "a very good one") to his name, but that by having his name on the paper it would acquire greater visibility. I again rejected this saying that I would prefer a situation in which no one read a paper that was correctly attributed than if many people read a paper that was incorrectly attributed. He has since not replied and I do not expect him to. 

This entire issue is pissing me off. Last semester I sent Eugene two emails about the work and asked for his input and he didn't respond to either of them. Now that I have submitted the article and it is in review, he responds immediately and asks to be listed as coauthor? How is this at all ethical? I think Eugene has been a little spoiled by his power and by the ignorance, naïveté, and credulousness of his research assistants. If all of your previous graduate students saw your discussions with them and your editorial help as contributions warranting co-authorship, wouldn't you begin to see such a situation as right? Perhaps you would go even further and believe that since the work was done within your research group, you should still be listed as coauthor even though you did not write any of the work, do any of the analysis, or even come up with the project in the first place. 


However, many academics, rather than seeing student thesis supervision as a teaching obligation, appear to believe that their own name is better known and should appear first or that the study is undergoing an "apprenticeship" and that it is the academic's right to be "recompensed" in this manner. It is my contention that this procedure is one in which there is exploitation of the student's position and work, and as this appears to be a growing practice, I believe that the academic community must turn its attention to its consequences and implications. ("Academics and Student Supervision: Apprenticeship or Exploitation?")



This growing tradition of having students working on an academic's own research interests also has other effects. Those who take the University Statutes seriously and work in an "independent" manner on projects of their own creation, developing their own theoretical and research interests, are at a serious disadvantage vis à vis those students who work under or with an academic on the academic's own project. The latter students typically have the resources expertise and equipment that either have already been assembled by the staff member (and his previous students) or are procured with little trouble through the influence and personal interest of the staff member concerned. Indeed, far from the situation of universities promoting free and independent enquiry among students, it is certainly not rare to find staff members who are only interested in supervising (or encouraging) students if the students can contribute to the staff member's pet projects or are prepared to work within the staff member's theoretical framework and research orientations.

Haidt's Telos
Jonathan Haidt commonly claims that the "telos" (i.e., main purpose) of the university is to pursue truth and any other objectives detract from this telos ultimately undermining it and the fidelity to knowledge that universities supposedly have. Haidt claims this in order to push against what he sees as excessive efforts to make the university more politically correct or more conscious of the ways students' identities might affect their lives on campus. Since universities can have only a single telos, and that telos should be the pursuit of "truth", the "social justice" objectives must be comparatively devalued with respect to the "truth" objectives. I disagree with the premise that a university can have only a single objective, but even if we were to claim that said objective were "truth" we would be wrong. Research universities don't only care about the knowledge that their professors build; they also care about overhead, grant dollars, recognition, and prestige. They care about citation counts and scientific popularity. That a university would finally be able align with its telos of truth in the absence of students' social justice efforts is not evident since problems unrelated to social justice already undermine said telos. Recognizing this, one could view Haidt's arguments cynically: He only feels most threatened by problems which adversely affect his position as a teacher in a university, and thus he conflates the absence of those problems with the proper functioning of the university. More generously, Haidt perhaps doesn't feel the need to advocate against the methodological and structural problems of the knowledge building enterprise of a university because other people have already spent many pages doing so. Apparently, much less has been written about explanations by older generations for why younger generations do not have the proper amount of respect for the institutions of which they are newly a part.

Notes on McClintock's Autobiography
I am almost done reading Evelyn Fox Keller's biography of Barbara McClintock. Parts of Keller's descriptions of microbiology and of McClintock's science are incredibly confusing, but there are parts of the book that present interesting perspectives on the sociology of science. Here is one such section

Scientists and philosophers of science tend to speak as if 'scientific language' were intrinsically precise, as if those who use it must understand one another's meaning, even if they disagree. But, in fact, scientific language is not as different as ordinary language as commonly believed; it, too, is subject to imprecision and ambiguity and hence to imperfect understanding. (pg. 145) 

This description reminds me of Kuhn's idea of "incommensurable paradigms". That scientists working within the same discipline can still misunderstand each other seems trite when one interprets this misunderstand as derived from different scientists using different languages. And yet, this metaphor of paradigms as being language does not really suggest incommensurability because languages usually have dictionaries that make translation possible. Rather, the incommensurability would only exist in those parts of the language which are untranslatable. I think this is the problem that McClintock faced when communicating her results to her colleagues. She had explored a particular domain of genetics on her own and did so using idiosyncratic methods. These factors alone would have made it difficult enough for her work to be understood by her colleagues, but what made it virtually impossible is that the phenomena that she discovered (transposition) did not seem to be to be translatable into her colleagues language and assumptions. It was simply something that was not seen as possible given how they saw the world, and thus they proved in capable of seeing it. 

Commenting on the non-rational ways that scientists construct and evaluate theories, Keller states 

…new theories (or arguments) are rarely, if ever, constructed by way of clear-cut steps of induction, deduction and verification (or falsification). Neither are they defended, rejected, or accepted in so straightforward a manner. In practice, scientists combine the rules of scientific methodology with a generous admixture of intuition, aesthetics, and philosophical commitment. (pg. 145) 

The fact that new theories are not constructed by clear-cut steps of "induction, deduction, and verification/falsification" is something that I know informally, and yet in the past two courses I have taught I have made that simple three step process seem absolute. I think I framed science this way partly because it's just easier to do so and partly because I wanted to present a logical and clean description of how physical theories are formulated. It would have been much more difficult and convoluted to describe the more accurate process in which scientists make theoretical guesses based on ideas, not always directly induced from the phenomena, about how reality should be. Ever more difficult would it have been to represent the practical use of deduction as quite different from a mathematical exercise, and rather more like a messy process in which scientists have to determine what questions should be answered, how these questions should be answered, and what standards exist for accepting an answer. I think when I write part II of my "structure of physics" notes I will need to include a more accurate description of the way new theories are created and accepted. Also,  I'm sure there is probably a large literature on this subject of the "true scientific method". 

Keller continues describing the influence of non-rational factors in the next sentences. 

The importance of what are sometimes called extrarational or extralogical components of thought in the discovery of a new principle of law is generally acknowledged. But the role of these extralogical components in persuasion and acceptance (in making an argument convincing) is less frequently discussed, partly because they are less visible. The ways in which the credibility or effectiveness of an argument depends on a realm of common experiences, or extensive practice in communicating those experiences in a common language, are hard to see precisely because such commonalities are taken for granted. Only when we step out of such a 'consensual domain'—when we can stand out on the periphery of a community with a common language—do we begin to become aware of the unarticulated premises, mutual understandings and assumed practices of the group. [boldface mine] (pg. 146) 

This passage expalins why McClintock found it so difficult to communicate with her colleagues and also hints at one of the qualities she possessed that made it possible for her to discover transposition. There are both explicit and tacit parts of the education of any scientist, and although it is often obvious how the explicit education informs what scientists believe, the tacit education, because it is both hidden and taken for granted, is much less apparent. This obscurity eventually proves problematic since it is the tacit commitments rather than the explicit models and information built upon them which often require extensive overhaul when something novel is encountered in science. In physics circa the 1900s, the tacit assumption that required overhaul was the idea that nature is fundamentally deterministic. Even if such an idea was never taught to apprentice-scientists in the 19th century, they would have internalized it anyway from all of their lessons on Analytical mechanics. Similarly, in physics today (or at least 20 years ago) a tacit assumption is that a "final" fundamental theory of physics, would have gravity being unified with the three other fundamental forces of the universe. With such an assumption in place, the work of the modern physicist is to find models which accurately articulate that assumption, rather than wondering whether the assumption is true. 

This is why McClintock's position put her such at an advantage. She existed apart from the growing microbiological community and consequently she did not have their tacit commitments. As a result, she did not take it as an assumption that genes were fixed entities and that the work of the microbiologist consisted of determining which proteins were synthesized from them. Her position as an outsider made clear to her the "unarticulated premises, mutual understandings, and assumed practices of the group," and she was thus able to clearly see when such attachments were wrong. 

However, being divorced from the community and having not accepted the community's tacit assumptions, McClintock was also not well versed in the explicit knowledge (i.e., experimental methods and techniques for verifying claims) that built upon that tacit knowledge. Consequently, the claims that she was making had to be filtered through her colleagues' frameworks which not only operated under tacit assumptions that she did not, but also had quite different standards for accepting when a claim was true. 

Another paragraph in the book concerns the issue of "consensus" in science and what it means. 

One of the characteristics of scientific development that most plagues historians is the enormous diversity of viewpoints that can continue to persist long after it appears that a consensus has been reached. The difficulty arises not only because consensus is never total, but also because of the fact that consensus always means the consensus of a particular community. (pg. 174)

How do you know what a scientific community believes? It appears it depends on how you define "scientific community" and also on what parts of that community you privilege as having more important voices than the others. And even when (or if) you can establish reasonable definitions of community and which people in those community have higher credibility, it would still be a mistake to consider as cardinal truth what that community believes. 

Not to beat a dead horse, but Keller's above description is another reason why Popper's notions of "falsification" are too simple to be useful. Yes, scientific theories should make unambiguous predictions and, yes, those predictions should be testable, but simply getting a null result in an experimental test does not always lead scientists to completely abandon the theory. Moreover, an experimental test that predicts something outside the theory also does not always lead scientists to abandon the theory. To say that these stalwart scientists are doing something "unscientific" by holding to their premises demands one define "science" as something distinct from what "scientists" do in practice and rather as something they should do. But such a definition would be a mistake. In physics and in microbiology there are good reasons to believe in theories even if experiments suggest such theories do not have the scope one initially believed. In such situations, scientists do not say that the theory is wrong (or that it has been "falsified") but that it is an approximation for a more accurate reality. 

In another situation McClintock faced the challenge of convincing her colleagues of the reality of transposition of genes. It was confusing to her why her colleagues did not accept the possibility that genes could relocate themselves within a chromosome given that it was already accepted that viral DNA could be inserted into and released from bacterial DNA. How was this viral DNA insertion-release process so distinct from the one that she was proposing?

In my ignorant perspective, perhaps the viral DNA insertion-release process was easier to accept than the resident DNA transposition process because the insertion and release of viral DNA was known to have a larger purpose (i.e., the propagation of virus genetic material) of a kind that transposition alone did not seem to have. Keller provides a sociological reason:

It was not the first time she had encountered such a seeming lack of logic in her colleagues. The cause? For McClintock it was what she calls 'tacit assumptions'—an implicit adherence to models that prevents people from looking at data with a fresh mind. These tacit assumptions impose unconscious boundaries between what is thinkable and what is not….Years of reading the literature, of listening to seminars, make it more rather than less difficult for them to become aware of their hidden assumptions to hear something new. The unfamiliar becomes increasingly unthinkable, and people forget that their interpretations of data are subject to change; they forget that theories and models come and go. The greatest danger, she finds, comes when people try to explain everything on the basis of what they think they know. 'That's why models, when they first begin to be promulgated, are so bothersome to me.' Out of sheer enthusiasm, the model gets mistaken for reality. [boldface mine] (pg. 178)


What's interesting here is that Keller and McClintock are not referring to the types of quantitative models I am familiar with, but are talking about a largely qualitative model called the "central dogma of molecular biology." McClintock criticizes her colleagues because of their unwillingness to see the limitations of their model, limitations they do not recognize perhaps because they have forgotten that the "central dogma" is simply a model. Rather than interpreting the model as an approximation of reality, the colleagues took the model to define reality itself and thus anything in their or other's experiments (e.g., McClintock's transposition phenomena) which contradicted the model must have, in their minds, seemed to contradict reality itself.

It is enlightening that the conflation between 'models' and 'reality' occurred in a scientific discipline supposedly beholden to experimental justification. It makes it almost inevitable that scientists working in fields, like theoretical particle physics, in which the separation between theory and experiment is orders-of-magnitude greater would make similar mistakes. And perhaps the conflation as it existed in 1960s molecular biology and the conflation as it exists now in theoretical physics is derived from the same source: The scientists McClintock describes above were the intellectual descendants of the physicists-turned-molecular biologists who developed the central dogma in the first place. Perhaps then there is something about the way physicists study and interpret the world that makes it common to believe that one's "mostly accurate" models of reality are reality itself. Indeed, the epistemology of physics does not really distinguish between interpretations in which Einstein's equations define spacetime or in which the equations model something physically deeper for which the characterization as "spacetime" is just a convenient and temporary handle. As another example, in Weinberg's Theory of Quantum Fields textbooks, he defines a particle as "an eigenket in Fock space" which is derived from "a particular representation of the Lorentz group" [my quotes are paraphrases] thereby doing exactly what McClintock admonishes: taking one's models of reality to define reality itself. 

I wonder: Is this substitution of models for reality a necessary precursor to building better models of reality, or is it the impediment that McClintock takes it to be?

Weekly Review

I wrote final drafts of the conclusion and introduction last week. The conclusion includes additional results which would require an additional appendix, but I think it is otherwise OK. I'll ask Rostam and Victor to read and edit it for me. 

The major section that remains for the dissertation is a literature review. From a preliminary outline, I have realized that I have little idea of how to write a literature review. To make the project somewhat more manageable I sought to divide the review into three sections: Biomolecules and Combinatorics, Combinatorics and Exactly Solved Statistical Physics, Exactly Solved Statistical Physics and Biomolecules. The intention was to find papers that exist in each of these three topic areas and to then discuss these papers in a way that segues naturally into my own work. But the papers associated with these sections are many and I am finding it difficult to know what to focus on. I'll search online and try to get some advice on how to structure literature reviews in general. My goal is to have a draft of this review written by the end of the week. 


I have been putting off two things: Reviewing and editing "Intellect in an Intellectual Space" and downloading and playing around with Pygame. I have good excuses for both avoidances. I want to finish the difficult aspects of my dissertation before I return to another difficult writing project. And I want to finish the population genetics problems before I start a project on ideal gas simulations. Hopefully, I can finish both the literature review and the population genetics problems this week so I can return to the essay and start the Pygame stuff next week. 

Some secondary goals for this week are to send "Old Prices and New Tickets" to the New Republic. I have sent it to three places so far and have gotten mostly silence. I wonder if it will ever be published. 

Also, I will submit the Insight Data Science Fellowship application this week. I am making contingency plans in case I have to leave academia, but I don't think I will specifically enjoy a data science position especially since there are other physics projects that I would like to work on. I am thinking about registering for the APS conference for the sole reason that it is here in Boston. Also, it should be covered by my VanVleck funds, and therefore be free. 

Below are random other tasks I'd like to complete by the end of the week.

# Describe your research to a non-expert * 
Please limit the description of your work to one paragraph (4-8 sentences). If possible, include a description of a key result, accomplishment, or breakthrough you made that is representative of your work.

By modeling biomolecular dimer systems as "dancing couples" problems, we find that the self-assembled configuration in such systems is most limited by the product between monomer diversity and volume. 

Say that many couples enter a dance hall. Immediately afterwards, the couples separate and mingle so that at a later time some people are alone and other people are paired up in possibly new couples. For this repairing, each person has the highest affinity to be with the person he or she originally came with. How can we determine the average number of people who are alone and the average number of people who are with their original partner at the later time? 

This problem maps onto the problem of biomolecules with promiscuous interactions. In this work, we couch the solution to the former problem in a statistical physics model which ultimately shows that assembly requires two conditions to be satisfied: a combinatorics condition limiting monomer diversity alone and a search condition limiting the product of monomer diversity and volume. For real systems, we the find that product between monomer diversity and volume is most constrained. 

Self-assembly is often difficult to study theoretically, but this work manages to deduce analytical conclusions about self-assembling systems while demonstrating that a seemingly irrelevant composite parameter is important in constraining the possibility of assembly.

Say that many couples enter a dance hall. Immediately afterwards, the people in each of the couples separate and mingle so that at a later time some people are alone and other people are paired up in possibly new couples. For this repairing, each person has the highest affinity to be with the person he or she originally came with and a lower affinity to be with anyone else, however, since each person has only one high-affinity partner, there is a greater likelihood for a person to find a lower-affinity partner. With these constraints, how can we determine the average number of people who are alone and the average number of people who are with their original partner at the later time? 

This combinatorial problem maps onto the problem of biomolecules (e.g., proteins, DNA) with promiscuous interactions. For the most part, biomolecule-biomolecule interactions within a cell are very specific with each biomolecule having a high affinity to its correct binding site or correct partner biomolecule. However, each biomolecule also often has a small affinity to other biomolecules, biomolecules that are usually so numerous that they can effectively compete with the high-affinity interaction. My work builds analytical models of these biomolecular interactions in order to understand the conditions under which the correct (i.e., high affinity) interactions dominate in protein-protein and protein-DNA systems. 

(In this work, we find that in achieving the self-assembled configuration, real biophysical systems are most limited by the product of particle diversity and volume, a new composite constraint that hasn't been predicted before.)

# What programming / scripting / statistical languages, data analysis software and/or databases have you worked with and in what capacity? Please make a detailed list. For each language, database or software, list how much time you spent working with it and briefly describe the work you did and what results you obtained to give us a sense of your proficiency.

IPython/Jupyter - This is the language I used for my Data Science and Stochastic Optimization courses. In the Data science course, I used Python in all assignments most of which involved accessing APIs to get data from websites and then using Pandas to organize and analyze data. In the Stochastic Optimization course, I also used Python in all assignments the most memorable of which involved Simulated Annealing and Metropolis-Hastings Algorithms. 

I still use Python in my research, mostly by employing Metropolis-Hastings algorithms to obtain simulation results that can be compared with analytical results in statistical physics systems. 

# Please describe any side projects relevant to data science you have completed (unrelated to coursework) - feel free to include links. [Optional] 
Descriptions and, if public, URLs of side projects that you have worked on that are relevant to data science.

In Spring of 2015, I worked as a data analyst contractor for Reasoning Mind.  Reasoning Mind (https://www.reasoningmind.org/) is a non-profit organization based in Houston which takes early math education curricula developed in Russian schools and adapts them into e-learning software for American students. My task was to analyze student usage data gathered from a software platform used in Texas middle schools.

The work consisted of parsing through the company's curriculum data and developing statistical analysis code to answer questions like
— What was average performance trajectory for all students throughout the curriculum?
— How often did students run out of time in answering questions?
— Did the student’s perspective on knowledge (e.g., Carol Dweck’s conception of fixed vs. flexible mindset) correlate with their performance? Did their performance affect their mindset?
— Did teacher engagement with the curriculum correlate with student performance?

Please include a short description of the courses and any in-course related projects that you may have completed.

In Fall 2014-Spring 2015, I took two courses related to data science. Harvard's Data Science CS209 and Stochastic Optimization AM207 courses. In CS209, my partner and I completed a final project on the "Data Science of Video Game Reviews." In my part of the project, I determined genres of video games where competition was low, current game quality was low, but public interest in was high. The motivation for the analysis was to find video game genres that provided low barriers of entry and high probabilities of success for new game designers.

In the final project for AM207, I used simulated annealing to solve what I called the "traveling post-graduate problem." The problem was as follows: Given a limited budget, how can someone travel to popular cities around the world while minimizing flight distance and maximizing personal enjoyment of the trip?

# What excites you about becoming a data scientist and working in the tech industry * 
Please limit your response to one paragraph (4-8 sentences).

Most of my technical education during my graduate and undergraduate education involved learning things I never applied outside a classroom. However, in a short-term data science position in 2015, I found that material I had learned in class merely months prior was immediately relevant to the tasks I was assigned. This is something I appreciate about working in data science: The chance for my technical skills to have immediate relevance in problems of wider relevance than pure science. Moreover, I like the way data science combines storytelling and analysis, taking a morass of seemingly random information and probing and framing it in such a way that something insightful can be gleaned from it. In few other fields of work do both tasks need to be so well integrated. 


Optional: Any comments or additional information you wish to share with us? 
This field is optional. Please feel free to leave it blank.

Between the end of my undergraduate and the start of my PhD, I returned to my former high school (Benjamin Franklin High School) to tutor students in physics class. I started tutoring in January of 2014 and continued on into the summer.

Meeting on "Old Prices and New Tickets" 
I met with Suzanne today to discuss the essay "Old Prices and New Tickets." First, she did not like this title. She thought the first title I sent to her, "The Price of a Harvard Education", was much better since it played on a non-traditional interpretation of price. I suppose she is right, although I originally moved away from this title because it seemed too sensational.

Suzanne gave me many useful comments but she generally saw in the essay things that I had not realized I was communicating. In the version I sent to her, I kept the following introduction. 

The personal experience of tokenism is to feel as though one stands in for a populace much
larger than oneself. Your thoughts become their thoughts. Your weaknesses, their weaknesses.
Your prejudices, their prejudices. And of course the transfer works in the opposite direction with
the features of the populace flowing back onto you, seemingly substituting what is personal in
yourself with what is shared by the larger group of people who look like you. You don't really
have any choice in this. No matter how you are, to some people, what you are obscures all else
and, as a result, you are painted as merely one of a much more general kind. Or, I suppose you
have some choices. You could try to fight against the constant attempts to tokenize you, or you
can leave, conveying disapproval by the simple refusal to participate in the dance of verifying or
countering the ways other people see you. But then again, the ability to do either is predicated on
the fact that you were allowed to even enter in the first place, a fact which is not at all guaranteed
if it was your tokenization itself which served as a barrier to entry.

This introduction must have been particularly gripping to her because one of her main comments was that I substantiate it with a personal account. To her it seemed that there was an undercurrent of experience motivating this introduction in particular and the piece as a whole, in general, and I should tap into this personal experience in order to craft a more personal essay. She is of course correct. The essay was supposed to be a longer piece on affirmative action, IQ, and my experience in academia but it was too difficult to combine all of these elements into one piece. In particular I realized that my personal narrative obscured the argument I was making about how one could feel in the current SFFA v. Harvard case reverberations from many other cases throughout history. 

But Suzanne's point is well received. To join any system, and more so for prestigious systems, one has to give something up and be willing to ignore flaws in the system which although posing no threat to you, certainly harm others. I had believed that I was immune to this exchange since I was a member of an underrepresented group and such bargains had in the past been made to ignore the discrimination of people who look like me. It is the common argument that black people cannot be racist, or rather the deeper claim that the marginalized cannot themselves marginalize others . Of course this is not true, and I have known it to be true for some time, but I did not see how it was relevant to the essay until Suzanne pointed it out to me. 

There are examples. The dining hall workers of Harvard had a strike, and I remember walking past them believing on some philosophical level that they were in the right, but still not joining them in their chants or marches. The Harvard graduate students sought to create a union and for months, it was not clear to me why such a thing was necessary; I was a content graduate student and did not see anything wrong with the way Harvard treated graduate students because there was nothing wrong with the way Harvard treated me. I can exist at Harvard, in a prestigious graduate program, and believe that the glut of Science PhDs is not really a problem because most Harvard graduate students manage to avoid the academic purgatory of adjunct-hood after they graduate. 

On some level I had known that Harvard, like all moneyed institutions, was not an exclusively benevolent actor and that it would always seek to protect the interests of people I could not see nor fathom, but in Octavia Butler's words "Knowledge motivates and guides action, or it does nothing."

In so many cases throughout my time at Harvard, I was blinded to the ways that my marginalization was only true in a very limited sense of the word. In so many ways I was and am part of the privileged if not by optics, certainly by the insularity of my grievances. You really can tell how insulated someone is from existential problems of life by what they consider to be their most pressing concerns. 

I am babbling. 

What else needs to be changed about the essay? It was entirely too general by Suzanne's measure. I say "People have said…" when I should use a specific quote. I present a quick historical overview. The prose is "half-academicized" which strangely seems to be worse than it being "entirely-academicized." There is a difference between tokenism as it exists in higher education and affirmative action, and it is not clear how the two merge in the case I am describing. 

Riffing on the introduction framed around tokenism, Suzanne suggested I delve deeper into the way that willingly stepping into your own tokenism forces you to pay a price. In this sense tokenism is both explicit and metaphorical. You pay a token to ride on the ship. You accept your tokenism to gain entry. And of course, you think you have made it and are safe, but of course the price has been paid, your identity has been circumscribed and the ramifications of the circumscription will be felt later, if not by you, certainly by your children or your children's children. 

One of Suzanne's many interesting points was that in order to gain admission into a system, one has to tacitly agree to give up his or her critique of the system. Your price is silence and what you get in exchange is the ability to be useful to other people. Upon admission, it is natural to give up possible critiques since an institution that makes space for you cannot, from a self-serving perspective, really be seen as unfair. To recognize its limitations requires you to make the herculean effort to step far outside of yourself and imagine that you were born somewhere else some time else, and to consider the possibility that if you too were effectively confined to the wilderness outside glass houses you also might want to grab a brick. I wonder how many Americans, so full of pride and love of God and country, would see themselves and their nation the same way had they been able to live for just a day this thought experiment. 

What are the last things that require change? Suzanne suggests there should be more reading behind this work. I do not want to do more reading. I do not want to stretch this piece into a 7500 word essay because doing so, I think, will make it dry and uninspiring. Mostly, I don't want to dip into the personal narrative material Suzanne suggests is necessary since that material is meant for a different piece. In all I just feel tired. I thought this essay was done, but it remains here in my folder collecting angst.

Too Tired to Write
I feel really tired, almost too tired to write anything. But I should write something. Something about how all this exhaustion will ultimately be worth it, or about how even if it is not worth it, the exhaustion is better than the silence of a perhaps less stressful existence. Explanations and justifications. Rationalizations and reasons. All to make me feel and think that the work I do now is moving me towards a better place. I am tired of the work. I am tired of the pre-pubescent navel-gazing that constantly questions the utility of the work. Both are masturbatory. Both are attempts to use the powers of analysis to gain control over something that cannot be controlled. I know this now and have already known this and although the train speeds headlong into the night, towards a destination I try not to think too hard about, I still fear jumping off into the unknown surrounding land, for in that space there might be things I do not want to find, things I had never believed could exist.

Conceptual Models and Analytical Tools: The Biology of Physicist Max Delbrück

Yesterday I finished reading Lily E. Kay's 1985 article on Max Delbrück. Her goal was to try to understand how a physicist managed to found the new field of molecular biology and also what motivated the particular philosophy that defined how questions were framed and their answers pursued in this new field.

Apparently Delbrück entered biology because he was looking for a domain in which he could do something akin to what Bohr, Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and Dirac did for atomic phenomena: use the domain to develop new laws of physics. In Kay's account

Cell theories, believed Delbrück, should not be formulated by applying old laws, but by looking for new ones without intellectual prejudice and without fear of contradicting molecular physics. (p. 212)

In his search for new laws of physics, Delbrück was ultimately unsuccessful, but he nevertheless found something quite interesting. Molecular biology ultimately proved to be governed by well-known principles of physics and chemistry, but Delbrück's approach to biology of seeking out the simplest model systems (like E. coli and its associated viruses) was a new way to explore the genetics of inheritance. His approach was fundamentally in line with two of the ways physicists studied phenomena in the 1950s and now: Reductionism and Modeling, reductionism referring to seeking out the phenomena on the smallest length scale relevant to a system and modeling referring to taking a specific but sufficiently general system to stand in for many other systems like it. 

There are many details in Kay's account of what led Delbrück to incorporate physics into the study of microorganisms, but what is most interesting to me is the similarity between Delbrück's search for a domain of biology amenable to simple analytical questions and the modern physicist's similar search for such questions in modern microbiology, population genetics, or any other field she wants to enter. Delbrück was looking for two things: a subject in genetics that was "compatible with analytical methods in mathematical physics and with the potential for applying Bohr's epistemological paradox," (pg. 229) the paradox referring to Bohr's complementarity principle. One major problem in finding the first thing was the shear complexity of most biological systems at the time. When he traveled to Caltech and T.H. Morgan's laboratory to give a seminar on his first paper, he found the Drosophila research there quite complicated. 

By 1937 the Drosophila terminology had become so specialized and esoteric that it would have taken Delbrück months to acquire proficiency in the technical vocabulary. Accustomed to the elegance of mathematical formulations, he pored disconsolately over scores of forbidding papers containing long and detailed genotypic maps. Failing to get a grasp of the material, he felt overwhelmed by the complexities of even the relatively well-defined Drosophila system. 

His experience with the niche area of Drosophila research matches my own experience when I first joined the Shakhnovich group. All of the group meeting presentations were filled with details that were in my mind disconnected to any foundational principles or larger story that motivated and justified them. Not only did I not understand what my group mates were discussing, but I also realized that their investigations were motivated by values oblique from my own. I was prone to ignoring details and seeking out a more general understanding, but in protein biophysics (especially as it is studied in a chemistry department) the details are crucial. 

Delbrück eventually found a system that could be studied genetically but was (at first glance) simple enough to not require a master of the terminology required of Drosophila research. He met with Emory Ellis who managed to set up a simple bacteriophage lab as an offshoot of Morgan's investigations. Delbrück was struck by how simple experiments could be used to visualize the birth and propagation of virus particles: 

I mean you could put them on a plate with a lawn of bacteria, and the next morning every virus particle would have eaten a macroscopic one-millimeter hole in the lawn. You could hold up the plate and count the plaques. This seemed to me just beyond my wildest dreams of doing simple experiments on something like atoms in biology. (p. 231)

In Kay's words, Delbrück was seeking a "simple model for gene action that could be treated mathematically," and he had found such a model in bacteriophages. In Delbrück's words, bacteriophage research provided "a fine playground for serious children who ask ambitious questions." Of course, as most scientists do when they enthusiastically start a new research direction, Delbrück underestimated the difficulties in studying this organism. Since not much data was available for bacteriophages in 1937, Delbrück had to largely develop on his own standardized procedures for describing growth cycles of phages, the process of phage attack, and the number of phages released from a bacterium. After establishing this experimental foundation (and codifying it in the paper "The Growth of Bacteriophage") Delbrück then developed the theoretical methods needed to study bacteriophage production quantitatively. 

In this sense Delbrück's original motivations were being realized. He had found an arena in biology whose properties could be phrased quantitatively and thus be analyzed with methods more common to mathematical physics. His larger goal of using methods taken from physics to fully understand life and thereby (he hoped) find even newer physical laws still was remote. First, the bacteriophage was proving to be a complicated genetic system, and thus it didn't seem likely (at around 1945) that it would take the short time he previously predicted to unravel all his secrets. Secondly, in all of his investigations he was not finding new laws of physics. Ultimately Crick, Franklin, and Watson, the latter a student of his collaborator Salvador Luria, resolved both issues by finding a chemical basis of life and indirectly showing that said chemistry was beholden to the same laws of physics as inorganic matter that physicists better understood. 

Delbrück was unsuccessful in his personal objective (finding new physics laws), but he still managed to find something that contributed to science (a new approach to studying genetics and inheritance of microorganisms). This fact is reminiscent of Feynman's failure to remove the fields from quantum electrodynamics, but his success in developing a new approach to quantum mechanics. It is like the quote in Lakatos's "Proof and Refutations": "Columbus did not reach India, but he still managed to find something interesting." Perhaps the quote is more appropriate than it seems because what followed Columbus's "discovery" of the New World was hundreds of years of colonialism and exploitation, and today the intellectual descendants of Delbrück seem to be pursuing a new and alarmingly fungible style of genetic research in which humans can engineer mutations at will. Some people say that the world might have been better off had Columbus just stayed home. In the future, would some people say that the world would have been better off if Delbrück hadn't sought to apply a physicist's values to biology? 

Anyway, I am grateful for Kay's essay. It was an interesting read showing how things have an have not changed in physicist's approaches to new subjects. Personally, I think it would not be correct to claim that Delbrück ushered in the field of biophysics since his investigations were more mathematical in content even if they were "physical" in inspiration. Still his story reveals the clear difficulties in beginning a new research program and building up its foundations so that it can be of interest to other people.

Meeting with Brenner

I met with Michael Brenner last Friday. We scheduled the meeting to discuss my recent rejections from all the fellowships I applied to. My hope was that he would suggest alternative post-docs to apply to, some other way for me to continue on in academia. His focus was quite different. What he mainly wanted to convey to me was the fact that these rejections could not be used to infer anything about the quality of my work or my potential as a physicist. He said from his own experience in faculty searches, even when a candidate is an excellent fit for the institution and ticks off all the requisite boxes, there is at most a 50% chance that he or she will receive the position. It depends on the mood of the committee, what they're looking for at a particular time. Even when he had headed a committee, he was surprised by the outcome of a search. He could not predict in advance who would ultimately be offered the position. It's essentially a 50-50 toss up, he said, and usually the odds are worse. 

I thought about this and my mind flashed to Jesse Thaler. I met him in the Spring of 2010. He had just arrived at MIT. Throughout my first year working for him and reading his papers, it was clear to me that he was according to some externally accepted measure (if not according to my personal one) an excellent physicist. Back then it was difficult to imagine him any other place besides MIT. And yet now Michael was suggesting that even Jesse's acceptance into the institute was likely based on luck. Part of me could not believe it. Part of me must have known it had to be true. 

Michael also said that biophysics was strange in the way that people in the field worked on such different things that it was impossible to rank them in anyway. He routinely received calls from other universities that were considering multiple candidates for a position and who asked him to rank their candidates. "Who was better?" they'd ask. "I don't know. Why don't you figure it out?" was his response. Who was better depended on what the department wanted. There was no universal scale for all biophysicists, so he always found such requests impossible. 
 Mathematics, he said, was different. Apparently, you could go to all the algebraic topologists at Harvard and ask them to rank the five best people in the field and they would all come up with exactly the same list. He admitted there were problems with the mathematician's views in this regard, problems that would require an entirely different discussion, but that mathematician's at least believed they could do this while it was clear that those working in his field could not. 

I think Michael's claims would still stand if he replaced "Algebraic Topology" with high energy theory. Ask anyone in high energy theory who the five "best people" in the field are and you would likely get large overlaps in the lists, with most of the members consisting of physicists from the Institute for Advanced Study. My guess is that the list would always include Maldacena, Arkani-Hamed, and Witten. What's more, I think this list would be the same had you asked this question 15 years ago. What allows such a ranking to be possible in a field of research? And was the ability to so easily rank scientists in this way the reason I found high energy theory so claustrophobic? Did I already know that my work would not fall in line with what the field claimed was important and thus did I preemptively opt out of trying to convince peers of the value of work that even I did not believe in? 

To be able to have such an unambiguous scale of measure for scientists, a community has to agree on at least two things in their discipline. They have to agree on what the most pressing problems in the discipline are, and they have to agree on who contributed the most to the solution of those problems. In high energy theory today, the community thinks the most pressing problems are quantum gravity and LHC-scale beyond-the-standard model physics. The field believes Witten and Maldacena have made significant contributions to the former and that Arkani-Hamed has made significant contributions to the latter. Underneath this agreement of who has contributed the most the solutions is a tacit agreement of what constitutes a solution at all. Lee Smolin and Carlo Rovelli have both contributed to quantum gravity research and Lisa Randall has contributed to beyond-the-standard model research, but I don't think they would make the list. Not because they do not deserve to make the list, but simply because the community has chosen a particular direction of research focus and this direction exists obliquely to the contributions Smolin, Rovelli, and Randall have made. 

When I started working with Jesse, it did not take me long to recognize this feature of high energy physics. I read so many papers and yet I disliked them all. The problem was not that I did not understand the technical features of the work. It was that I could not even appreciate the epistemic motivations underlying the work. I did not feel the pull of curiosity which naturally leads one to stop, sit quiet, and listen to a new story being told.  The questions these physicists were asking, the reasons they were asking these questions, and the standards they sought for answers seemed not to be rational extensions to the physics I had learned in the past, not even to be the natural historical followups to what I had read in Schweber's QED. These values seemed to grow from a different source, one I did not share, and I knew that if I was to stay in high energy physics I would have to somehow internalize these standards, not because I believed them to be right, but because I believed them to be universal. 

Biophysics was different. Although I could not personally appreciate why finding a theory of quantum gravity was important outside of an egocentric desire to simply find such a theory, I could immediately appreciate why it would be interesting to find some more concrete physical basis for the life-processes which seemed so distinct from physics. I disliked many of the papers I read in biophysics, but mostly because I did not like the way they explored the field of biophysics. I disliked the way current practitioners framed and answered questions, but I appreciated the questions themselves, and thus there was a space for me in biophysics that did not exist in high energy physics. Of course, I did not believe this two years ago, but thinking back on my recent work and placing that work in the context of my Systems biology class five years ago and all the seminars I have attended, I know it is true. The questions of biophysics captured me in a personal way, a way that I had only been pretending to be captured when I worked in high energy theory.

(***)

Michael kept going along this vein, trying to encourage me. He said that my work was awkwardly placed because no one really did what I was doing. In this field of the physics of living systems, people did not abstract analytically rendered physical models from the systems they studied. They wrote code and ran simulations and took the product of the simulation as the basis for their understanding. In this way, he said my work was different, but not unimportant. In fact, he thought it was incredibly important and he wanted me to continue doing it. Which was why he was trying to make sure I was not discouraged. 

More strange still was that I was unusually independent for a graduate student. He said that in all his years advising students he had not seen a student do what I was doing: choose, frame, and pursue the solution of problems on his or her own. This independence, he assured me, was a good thing. He explained that the difficulty of research existed in two directions. There was the difficulty in finding a good problem and the difficulty of a technical solution to that problem: Asking good questions and finding reasonable answers. I had managed to learn how to do both as a graduate student, and this was atypical. However, he said that he also said there is an advantage in doing what I had not done, in getting a problem from an advisor. The advantage in a potential graduate students going to David Nelson, him, or Eugene and asking for a problem is that professors are all well-invested in the cultures of their discipline and thus they know which problems other people would be interested in. These professors could assign their students problems knowing that if the student successfully completed the problem, there would be a reasonable place for him or her in their scientific community. 

I remember Alan Lightman saying something similar. He talked about receiving applications (post-doctoral? faculty? I can't remember) from around the world in which it was clear that the applicant was technically strong. However, Lightman argued that these applicants seemed to apply their abilities in directions that were not important, directions that failed to take measure of the questions their fields of research were currently preoccupied with.  According to Lightman, or according to my reading of him, these applicants failed because they could not do the very thing Michael was telling me that Professors did for their students. 

At the time I did not think of telling Michael that I had both heard and tried this before. Jesse had told me what my role was as an undergraduate and as a graduate student and so I had tried for many years to follow the research directions my professors provided. I did not tell Michael that after all those years of effort, this model of apprenticeship had, for some reason, not worked on me and that I had been compelled to find another way, rather than outright leaving physics, only because I had lacked the vision to see myself as anything other than a physicist. 

At another point during this conversation, a point that I cannot place exactly in the sequence of advice, stories, and explanations, he said that he always found it more interesting when technical solutions were embedded in larger problems that themselves had some physical consequence. I agreed with him. That is certainly something I have learned over the past year. I thought my "statistical physics of the symmetric group" work was good and that my "permutation glass" work was better, but what is particularly special about the "self-assembly of a dimer system" is that at the end it manages to step outside the mathematics and find someway to interpret physical reality through the dictates of the model. Such a perspective lends to reality a beauty and austerity held by the model itself and one finds that the model too gains in significance by the very fact that it is not a mere conjuring of the human mind. I had always had the philosophy that a "physical investigation myst begin and end with the phenomena" which is to say that the phenomena motivates the model and that the results of the model are used again to better understand the phenomena. Until the "self assembly" paper this philosophy was only just believed. The paper had allowed me to put it into practice.

Michael ended this part of the discussion by saying, in spite of these caveats, he did not want me to change. He thought what I was doing was good, and that I should not be made lost by all these rejections. Then he paused and looked up at the ceiling. "Maybe there is one way you should change," he said.

He said that my style of work would be better appreciated if I worked on problems that people cared about more than protein folding. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning being so prominent these days, he suggested that I apply my style of finding abstracted and analytically soluble models to studying the background theory of these subjects. He said that I wouldn't even have to change much since statistical physics and information theory are well connected these days and many physicists in the former are starting to work on the latter. Much of the work that they're doing comes down to "computing probability distributions", so he said that my own work would only need to be changed slightly in order to fit into this milieu. He suggested I attend the "Geometric Approaches to AI" conference happening at the CMSA that weekend (I did attend talks by Tomaso Poggio and Guy Bressler. Both were largely incomprehensible to me) and another conference at Harvard happening this week whose title he could not remember. (I think it is the "Data Science at the Frontier of Discovery" Symposium or the "Harvard DataFest").

30 minutes into our conversation, someone knocked on his door. Michael had another meeting scheduled. He asked the person to wait for five more minutes and concluded with me. He again told me that I shouldn't feel discouraged by my application results and that he would be free to talk again later to see "how things were." He said that there were other things I could do, i.e., post-docs I could apply for, etc., if my other applications didn't come through. I thanked him for his suggestions and left. 

How do I feel about Michael's advice? Now, a few days later, I am thankful for it, but at the time I thought it was misplaced. He seemed to think that I would take these rejections as an evaluation of myself, as though the fact that neither Princeton, Berkeley, MIT, nor SFI gave me a post-doctoral fellowship would lead me to question my abilities. In fact. however, a perverse part of me relished these rejections because they proved to me the imperfections in academia's system of evaluation. Here I was, someone who (I believed) had done good work, work likely more original and interesting than that of my competitors and even of some of their advisors, and yet all these institutions could not see that. Six years ago, I had been in the reverse position: Being championed and sought after by universities for work that I knew to be mediocre. Having lived a life that was fraudulent and rewarded and now living one which was more honest but unrecognized, there was little question as to which I preferred. And having made it to that more honest life, and having found partial solutions to the problems of how to "be" a scientist, I at last felt a peace that rejections could not take away. In my head, this series of rejections only served as material for a chapter in my autobiography, a chapter which was almost writing itself since it had been written by others so often before: The underdog, unappreciated for so long, rises again and makes those who rejected him cognizant of their past blindness. I thought these rejections were pat, almost boring. I was not threatened by what they said about me. Rather I was more concerned with the prospect of not being able to continue my research work after I graduated. Advice on how to get a different fellowship, not encouragement about my abilities, was what I sought. 

This was arrogance. I am not so unaware to not see it. To say that my work is likely better than the work not only of my competitors but of their advisors is brash especially given that I don't know the literature well enough to make such statements. Brash given what Michael just told me about the inability to rank physicists in biophysics. Perhaps this arrogance, like most pride, is a mask for insecurity. Perhaps I hold fast to my sense of superiority because it is a panacea, because I have not yet freed myself from the inferiority for which it is a counterbalance. Perhaps my pride is as large as the previous paragraph makes it seem. 

But Michael gave me a different perspective. Perhaps there was a lens through which I could see these rejections as existential, as saying something fundamental and negative about me, rather than saying something about the institutions that are evaluating me. But to have taken these rejections personally would have been inconsistent with the mindset that led to the work that was being rejected. In order to lay the foundation for the "Statistical Physics of the Symmetric Group" and all the work that followed it, I had to let go of the relevance of an external evaluation. I had to give up on seeing myself through the eyes of other people, and had to find ways to see myself and my work outside the frameworks created by others. If I was never released in this way, then I would never have completed this work in the first place. How silly would it be, now that this work was years in my past and after it had been followed up by other work cultivated from the same philosophy, for me to take as true that which I knew to be false? 

I had freed myself from my own insecurities and thus I felt freed from the insecurities others could create in me. 
I don't think my experience is special here. People always invest so much time and energy trying to break free from cages created by their own ignorance, only to get free and discovery still more cages created by the ignorance of others. But those first cages are always the most important to escape. If you manage to move beyond them, you find that it is easier to move beyond the restrictions others have made for you. It is easier because, having struggled with your own limited interpretations of yourself and your life, you no longer accept someone else's interpretations as all there is and thus the way they try to hem you in with a seemingly all-confining boundary is revealed to be a painted square in a world of three dimensions, and instead of having to "break free" of anything, you find that all you have to do is step over a line. 

What now? I will take Michael's advice. I had always wanted to learn more about how statistical physics was related to information theory, and with Michael's suggestion I have added reason to make real that desire. But I also need to more concretely entertain the possibility that I will not be in academia eight months from now. In preparation for such a scenario I need to think to myself what I will do, whether the work I am doing now is important enough that it will take up my evenings and weeks while I spend my days working to some other ends.

Weekly Review
I completed most of the tasks I set for myself last week. I completed all of the outstanding simulation and population evolution tasks and the house keeping tasks involving my registration for this semester. The population genetics work was oddly tiring to complete, and I still have not written a solution to the evolutionary rescue problem I set for myself, the problem which was largely my motivation for learning all of this material. From a cursory glance at the framework for the problem, I am not even sure that a solution exists. 

OK! Enough complaints. What are the tasks for this week? I want to contact Victor and schedule an informational interview with him. I hope to parse his motivations for leaving academia and ask him about the possibility of doing research while in an industry position. I need to apply to the insight data science fellowship. Perhaps this fellowship is a long-shot and I should apply to consulting jobs as well. 

On the other side of preparing for my future, I need to complete the literature review for my thesis. My goal is to have a draft of my thesis ready to send to my committee before I leave for Nigeria (i.e., before February 15),  but this literature review is dragging on and on. The main source of the delay is that I don't really know how to write a literature review for my topic of interest. Guides say I should collect research related to my problem, but the problems in the dissertation are not unified behind a common theme. There are short literature reviews (if you can call them that) at the start of each chapter, but I was hoping to write something more comprehensive at the introduction. This introductory literature review would introduce the ethos behind the dissertation even if it didn't go into the details of the problems themselves. 

My game plan is to try to get more advice online about how to structure a literature review for a thesis associated with a collection of problems. Maybe watching a well-selected youtube video on literature reviews will give me information beyond the standard and obvious descriptions concerning how to construct one. 

So! Applications and literature review are two goals. A third goal is preparatory. There are some projects that are obvious extensions of the work that exists in the thesis, and given my current precarious position in academia, I realize I should put these extensions in better shape in case I am unable to work on them extensively in the future. Here are the three projects:
# Field Theory for the Symmetric Group: We take the continuum limit of various models of thermal permutations. What do we get?
# Partitions, Aggregation, and Partition Functions: Using a partition function formalism, and number theoretic definitions of partitions, to describe aggregation. 
# Probabilistic Derangements: A generalized description of the theory of thermal derangements. 

Towards this preparation, I want to add three problems to the personal problems document which follow the above listed themes. 

Finally, I have the "Intellect in an Intellectual Space" essay that has been sitting on my shelf for long enough. I think I can read it and edit it this week even if I don't ultimately write anything new. 

Weekly Tasks
# Apply to Insight Data Science
# Contact Victor on LinkedIn; schedule video conference or informational interview
# Write draft of literature review for dissertation; Maybe determine if literature review is even necessary?
# Write up problem drafts for the three listed projects
# Read through the entirety of Intellect in an Intellectual Space; Mark up piece
# Create schedule for this week OCS, Bok Center, and Jean Luc Doumont Sessions





source of these delays is my ignorance of how to write a literature review.

Confronting the internal dialogue

Warning: Disgustingly high levels of narcissism follow

I have to make an uneasy peace with this thing that has been plaguing me for weeks. Here is the problem: My very first paper appears on the arxiv with Eugene as my coauthor. I submitted this paper to the arxiv on January 25 in 2017, but after talking to Victor (Zhao) and reviewing authorship guidelines, I realized—or did I "decide"?—that Eugene's contribution merited more of an acknowledgment than a coauthorship. Eugene had read the paper and suggested edits, but since I came to him with the project idea, devised and completed the analysis, and eventually wrote it up alone I realized a coauthorship would not reflect relative author contributions. So for the "official" version of the paper, the one published by the Physical Review E in April 2017, I am the sole author and Eugene is included in the acknowledgments. 

One might think that the issue would now be resolved. I had made a mistake in the authorship attributions for the preprint version, but the final version set the record straight. 

But recently my mind has been digesting the fact of the inconsistency between the arxiv preprint and the Physical Review publication. What if someone 


The problem is my pessimism. One finds the paper "Statistical Physics of the Symmetric Group" and finds the arxiv version which includes Eugene and I as coauthors. Maybe if such a person looks for the "official" and citable version of the paper, he or she will find the Physical Review publication which includes me alone as a coauthor. If the person cared at all about the authorship and was for some reason not only interested in the content of the paper, then the discrepancy between the arxiv and PRE versions would seem strange. What conclusion would he or she come to? My mind came up with a number of possibilities. First they could conclude something consistent with what actually occurred: 

The PRE version is the official version of the paper, and Mobolaji W is responsible for both the initiation and the execution of the project. The change in authorship in moving from the arxiv to the PRE version just reflects a decision between the coauthors that Eugene S's contribution merited an acknowledgment rather than a coauthorship. 

But they could also conclude many other things inconsistent with what what actually occurred. 

The arxiv version, since it appeared first, is the more reliable version and the PRE paper just reflects Mobolaji W's desire to make the work appear like he initiated it himself. 

The PRE version is the official version of the paper, and Mobolaji W is responsible for both the initiation and the execution of the project. However, the fact that Eugene S is not on the official version indicates that he did not want to vouch for the work and hence that it is of substandard quality.

The arxiv version, although not official, is the version that will be most read since it is freely available online (unlike the PRE version that is hidden behind a paywall). From this version it appears that Mobolaji W and Eugene S are coauthors, until it is recognized that Eugene S is a senior scientists in which case it appears that Mobolaji W simply executed a project assigned by Eugene S

These are the possibilities that have been floating through my mind over the past few days, weeks, months. Most strange of all, my mind does not seem to take what actually occurred into account. It does not matter that only one of the above scenarios is correct. The only thing I seem to be preoccupied with is what the inconsistency "seems" to suggest to other people. It is the external perspective, what other people may think when they look at the two papers, that my mind has been constantly drawn towards and constantly trying to find some way to correct. 

Of course the preoccupation with these possibilities is something that cannot be defeated through direct engagement, since slaying one insecurity merely grows two more in its place. These hypothetical people, the ones I imagine will look at these papers and judge me, will walk down one of the above routes (or maybe even one not listed) due to assumptions and experiences I cannot guess. I can claim that some routes are unlikely but that does not mean that they are impossible, and thus I open myself again to vulnerabilities. In the end, what my mind always sees is the person selecting the least generous options and thus concluding that the paper is not "truly" reflective of my abilities due to the coauthorship.

I tell myself that it is my first paper and that the authorship is less important than I think it is, but I remain unconvinced. This mania is not about how I see myself. It is about how I think others see me. How strange! How can I be preoccupied with this? How can someone who is so misanthropic, so disdainful of authority figures, and so uninterested and unimpressed by the morass of scientific work published every day, feel insecure about how the scientific community may view him? Perhaps underlying this insecurity is the belief that these external judgments are well-founded, that the most pessimistic of the routes outlined above may be factually incorrect but correct in spirit.

 It has been two years since I published this paper, three years since I completed large parts of the analysis, and four years since I took the class that began this work. Already, the work feels very much like another person did it, as if any accomplishment it represents does not belong to the person who is writing to you now. Maybe this is the reason my mind seems to be so easily preoccupied with this external perspective. It is looking for some anchor which can prevent my further drift into self-alienation. But I know, have known for more than ten years, that anchors grounded in the minds of other people are often worse than no anchor at all. And yet still I am concerned. 

I partly believe the scientific community will make such ungenerous interpretations because I look unlike most of my peers. I do not embody the classical image of a good scientist and so I know (or, believe I know) that it will be easy for others to discount what I apparently achieved and to claim that it was not really I who achieved it. Wouldn't these people, unarticulated prejudices pushing them all the way, conclude that my atypicality indicates that I cannot succeed in the ways that everyone else succeeds? Probably, my mind says. 

But maybe there is a deeper truth in this answer that I have not recognized. Maybe it is true that I cannot succeed in the way that others succeed, and maybe this is indeed because I am different. But the truth of this statement does not indicate that success is impossible, only that I need to find my own way, to write my own script based not on the emulation of anyone else but directed by a pull that only I can feel.

I write all of this in an attempt to expiate this mania. It has been distracting me, filling spaces in my mind which could more productively be set aside for thinking about the future. And the future is indeed the thing that is important. The only thing this event from the past can provide to the person who exists now is experience. Experience that I have already begun to apply to the future. The authorship decision for the Self-Assembly paper was made easier given my experiences two years ago: I had learned that there were personal costs to diluting your intellectual work through specious additional authorships, costs which outweigh the benefits the community tells you exist. 

What remains before me now are many facts: I have a personal record consisting of emails and notebooks which reveal how the idea began and how it was executed. Still, I will never be able to convince myself that other people will correctly interpret the inconsistency in the authorship. But this partly does not matter because the work and the authorship decision was made two years ago, and the only thing it can provide me now are the lessons about what to do in the future. Finally, it is this future which is the most important because I have much more that I would like to do and it would be a tragedy far worse than the co-authorship mistake if I allowed my preoccupation with that mistake to prevent me from doing that future work. 

It is in the past. It is done. What remains is what you will do next. What remains is what you will continue to do.

The Personal and the Scientific 

I'm reading Alan Lightman's essay collection "A Sense of the Mysterious". In the first essay, he expresses what he sees as a dichotomy between creating art and doing science. 

The most important equations are those that can be rederived by anyone with sufficient training. If Heisenberg and Schrödinger hadn't formulated quantum mechanics, then someone else would have. If Einstein hadn't formulated relativity, then someone else would. If Watson and Crick hadn't discovered the helical structure of DNA, then someone else would. Science brims with colorful personalities, but the most important thing about a scientific result is not the scientist who found it but the result itself…In a sense the result already exists. It is only found by the scientist. 

In the arts, the individual is the essence. Individual expression is everything. You can separate Einstein from the equations of relativity, but you cannot separate Beethoven from the Moonlight Sonata. No one will ever write The Tempest except Shakespeare or The Trial except Kafka. 

In a way I do agree with Lightman. Results in science are independent of scientists in a way that the products of music, writing, paintings are not independent of artists. But I think Lightman is too black and white about this. It may be true that Einstein's theories of brownian motion, quantization, and relativity were independent of him, but it certainly took someone like him in order to develop them, someone who had a scientific philosophy grounded both in the "free invention" of fundamental laws and in finding connections between physical theories. It may be true that electric and magnetic fields can be conceived of as fields independent of Faraday's interpretation of them as such, but it took someone who was not distracted by mathematics (simply because he did not know it) and who was capable of solid qualitative reasoning in order to first find that interpretation. The examples of Heisenberg and Schrödinger further prove this point. Both physicists developed theories of quantum mechanics, theories later found to be equivalent, but each one reflected the epistemic leanings of its developer: Heisenberg's mechanics grounded in abstract and non-intuitive matrices which were unfamiliar to most established physicists, and Schrödinger's mechanics grounded in partial differential equation methods commonly known to his generation of physicists. 

It is apparent that the theories of science always bear some mark of their creators, even if the basic conclusions of these theories are, as a matter of practice, independent of them. It is harder to make this claim for purely experimental discoveries since the scientist in this case is not developing a new theory, but in the cases when something must be interpreted there is almost always a space for the personal characteristics of a scientist to seep through. 

My point is similar to the one Ian Hacking makes in "How Inevitable Are the Results of Successful Science." He argues that there are many interpretations of phenomena that are consistent with some larger and human-independent notion of truth and yet nevertheless different. Thus if human history were to start over and proceed again, scientists (or the alternative-history version of what we call scientists) might still discover electromagnetism, the chemical basis of life, and the atom, but the theories they use to interpret these phenomena and the resulting descriptions would not necessarily be the same as our own. 

On the other side of Lightman's argument is the claim that what artists create is unique to the artist. Let's consider writers. According to Lightman, only Jonathan Franzen could write Freedom and only Toni Morrison could write Beloved. I agree that this is true in an explicit "what is written and by whom" sense, I don't know if it is true in the softer sense of "what is the cultural place of what is written." All writers exist in particular cultural spaces defined by time and geography and status. These writers indeed create works born from unique personal histories, but the fact that what is created resonates so strongly with a population much larger than the writer herself, suggests that the work is somehow more universal than the experience which preceded it. In a way, these writers, much like scientists, must be engaging with truths that are independent of them even though it took their work to expose it. This is to say that although John Steinbeck wrote East of Eden I can imagine an alternative history in which a writer or several other writers wrote novels which contained much of the same message as East of Eden. 

In doing either science or art, individuals seek to distill and comprehend their own experiences and interpretations of the world, and to connect what they learn to their communities' struggle for comprehension. In science, it seems that what the individual finds is independent of her and in art it seems that what is found cannot be divorced from her, but works of science always bare the marks of their creators and art always connects us to something that exists beyond the artist.

Responsibility
If you see something has value, or that it has the potential of value, and this value is not recognized by other people, then you have a responsibility to bring this value to light. You must do the work necessary to expose this hidden thing to others so they can appreciate it and build upon it. 


My inductive argument is better than your inductive argument! How do I know? Because of induction!

The "Why Pure Math Works?" Question

In "Inventions of the Mind", an essay in his collection A Sense of The Mysterious, Lightman explores answers to the common question of why results in pure mathematics often are used to model nature. He presents four possible responses to this question. 

1. Humans use language to describe their reality: Mathematics is "just another human language and when we wish to describe a new phenomenon of nature, we draw on whatever vocabulary is at our disposal." In this perspective mathematics "just happens" to be a convenient way to express our understanding of patterns we find in nature. We could describe quantum mechanics and general relativity using a less rigorous language, but it would be akin to giving people directions within a city without using the words left or right. 

Lightman uses this perspective of mathematics as language to suggest why pure mathematics always finds application to reality: "In this view, every idea in pure mathematics will eventually get 'used' [to describe nature] for the same reason that every word in a language eventually winds up in a sentence." 

This response is not very convincing to me. Pure mathematics can be seen as a language as long as one also admits that it is a language created to encompass a specific sort of abstract idea, often disconnected from a physical proxy. Humans always develop new words to describe new ideas. However, what is strange about pure mathematics is that the language that was developed to describe certain ideas, wholly unrelated to physical reality, is then found to be capable of describing natural phenomena. The better analogy would be as if you developed a new vocabulary to describe how engines work and years down the line you discovered that language is also a convenient way to describe the dynamics of fashion shows. Claiming that humans draw on "whatever vocabulary that is at our disposal" to describe aspects of our world does not completely resolve the question of why vocabularies from pure mathematics prove to be so useful. 

Or rather the claim translates the question to this: Why are the abstract ideas underlying pure mathematics and the phenomena of our world capable of being described by the same language? 


2.  Science and mathematics are both human constructions: 

"Pure mathematics and science both lie within the human mind. Therefore, it is no wonder that they should relate to each other, just as two successive thoughts often relate to each other." 

This perspective is interesting because it makes the relationship between pure mathematics and our understanding of natural phenomena seem trivial. In Lightman's words: "it is no wonder that they should relate to each other, just as two successive thoughts often relate to each other." 

One can take issue with the idea that science is socially constructed and also with the idea that mathematics is socially constructed. For example, in what way did humans "socially construct" the phenomena that we call gravity? Or in what way did humans "socially construct" the relationship between the sides of a triangle? These are good questions, but we don't need to answer them in order to find issue with this explanation. We can concede that mathematics and science are socially constructed and still see that this is an inadequate reason for why a relationship seems to exist between the two. 

There are many things in human society that are socially constructed. Our governments, our gender norms, our notions of nationality and family. And yet none of these things seem to have as intimate a connection with pure mathematics as does our study of the natural world. Recognizing this one might admit that there are ways in which governments, gender norms, etc. are socially constructed that differs from how scientific results is socially constructed and this difference is responsible for why the two groups relate to mathematics differently. But such an answer would concede that the original mystery had not been answered at all, and that one merely drew a wide circle around the problem and noted that it pertained to socially constructed understandings of our world. 

Why, the question remains, do these particular "socially constructed understandings" relate to each other in ways that neither relates to other such understandings? 

3. Mental resonance with nature: We humans, as part of nature, are intimately and unconsciously aware of its rhythms and regularities and thus we can perceive nature's logic, and that logic is pure mathematics. 

"In contrast to the previous explanation, the physical world indeed has its own independent existence, but somehow, perhaps through eons of evolution, our human brains have acquired the inherent logic of nature." 

This possibility is interesting and is less easily countered than the previous two. Lightman notes that it is similar to anthropic principle in physics. The principle claims that the physical laws and constants are what they are because these were the laws and constants which were needed to lead to the conditions of life and ultimately sentient beings who are capable of studying such laws and constants. 

Physicists typically dislike arguments by the anthropic principle. I think I heard someone claim that it was something like giving up and declaring victory. But apparently Steven Weinberg has used such arguments to estimate the value of the Cosmological Constant [His argument is worth inspecting.], so maybe they are not as empty as they seem. 

How is such an argument being applied to the question of why pure math and physics are related? Possibly, through the claim that our natural world can be described through the rigor and order of pure mathematics because any other natural world without such rigor and order could not create beings who eventually evolved to appreciate such rigor and order.  In this view, there is nothing special about a natural world that can be described through mathematics other than the fact that such a world is one in which life is ultimately possible.

But, of course, one could imagine a universe in which human life was not possible and which nevertheless was beholden to natural laws expressed through pure mathematics. The existence of humans is not required for there to be a "rhythm and regularity" to the natural world. 

But this is not what this explanation is saying, and therefore the explanation is different from the anthropic principle in physics. The explanation is not saying that nature has regularity because that it what was needed to create humans. Rather it is saying that nature has its own rhythm and regularities and that humans have merely become tuned to that rhythm over time. With this explanation clarified, one is remained with the question that was meant to be answered: 

Sidestepping the way humans describe nature through pure mathematics, and the fact that said mathematics for some reason matches the logic of nature, why does nature have a logic at all? 


4. Reality is not merely mathematical; It is mathematics: A radical possibility is that we are questioning an answer that we have already been given. Asking why pure mathematics can be used to describe the universe is akin to asking why rooks can only move horizontally or vertically in chess, and the answer in both cases is simple: It's just the basic rules of the game. Lightman's full quote is interesting. 

In this view, the physical objects we see, such as electrons or galaxies, are just material manifestations of an underlying mathematical plan, just as the many kinds of chessboards and arrangements of pieces on those boards are just representations of the abstract rules of the game. Perhaps there is no way the universe could have been put together except by following pure mathematics. In this interpretation, mathematical reality and physical reality, although seemingly different, are really part of a single reality. It would be no wonder, then, that pure mathematics often finds application to the physical world; it was there to begin with.

This explanation does not give one the intellectual satisfaction that explanations usually do. Like the the third explanation it relies on a logic for nature, but instead of claiming that the human invention of pure mathematics has evolved to match this logic, this explanation posits that said invention is this logic. In this way trying to find the answer to the question of "why  pure mathematics?" seems impossible, sort of like a bishop looking out at the world and trying to divine the underlying will of God. If you employ a deistic explanation of reality (e.g., "God brought the pilgrims to the new land"), you might be able to look out the world and find careful ways to describe what is happening, but at a certain point any questions you have concerning "why is this happening?" will run up to the boundary of something your explanatory framework is supposed to take for granted. In the same way, we can describe the world through mathematics and accept our descriptions only in so far as we accept that the world can be described through mathematics. While working within such explanatory frameworks it is impossible to find good answers to the question of why the framework works at all because such answers exist outside the framework and the standards and values therein, by which we typically answer questions. 

So, also like the third explanation, this one feels like a copout. In the absence of finding an answer to the question of "why mathematics?" we have deemed the question meaningless or at least not meaningful in a way that we define meaning when describe the natural world. For example, it is meaningful to ask, and possible to answer, the question "Why does the ground state of the electron have a binding energy of -13.6 eV?" But the same standards we use to evaluate the answer to this question cannot prove useful when we try to answer "Why does the algebra of matrices and inner product spaces serve as such a good language for describing atomic systems?"

So recap of last week: I completed problem statement write-ups for the "Probabilistic Derangements," "Partitions, Aggregation, and Partition Functions," and "Field Theory of Symmetric Group" problems. I contacted Victor on LinkedIn. I also wrote a cover letter and resume for the Insight Data Science fellowship, and wrote drafts of answers to the free-response questions. One major thing I failed to do was read and mark up the entirety of "Intellect in an Intellectual Space," although I did manage to edit the first page for that text. I also failed to write my literature review, to read Yue's paper, and download/run pygame. 

What is up for this week? I need to write Matt's student-advisor review. What I mostly need in this regard is good stories and I think my journal entries about him from the past year or so would give me good material for this review. 

I want to get all my application materials in order for the data science fellows program. That means the free response questions, the cover letter, and the resume. Neal helped me with the latter two by providing constructive (or, eviscerating?) criticism about my format and paragraph choices. I think I will review these components a few more times before finally submitting them. My hope is still to submit these application materials this week (maybe this Friday?)

I also want to start on the literature review. I have been stalling pretty hard on this task, partly because it seems like such a large activity. This is my fault undoubtedly. I need to spend some time thinking seriously about how to narrow the review to something I can conceivably tackle and which is still wide enough to cover the field of my thesis.

Weekly Review 

I forgot to create a task list on this document for last week's weekly review, so I cannot explicitly check off what I did and did not complete. I will state what I completed instead. 
Here are the two major things. I wrote Matt's adviser review letter by last wednesday, and I submitted my application for the Insight Data Science program this morning. 

With regard to the Insight application, I completed the application over the weekend and delayed submitting it because my personal website link was not working. But the link started working this morning so I sent off the application immediately. The only problem is I did not review the application before I sent it out. I did of course review it last weekend, but maybe a second review would have been beneficial as well. Anyway, it's done I suppose. I should now look forward to other data science and misc jobs. 

And, I should do a better job of trying to finish my god-forsaken dissertation. It is shameful to admit that I still have not finished the literature review, now almost a month after I tasked myself with completing it. The first few weeks I didn't complete it because I was distracted by other projects (i.e., evolutionary dynamics project), the next few weeks it was more or less laziness and a lack of direction. Now, I have a better sense of why the last few weeks went as they did. The task I gave myself for the literature review was just too large and the effort I was willing to expend to complete it was too small. Moreover, after reading about the structure of "three-article" dissertations, it is not a given that my dissertation will require a literature review. However, I still want to write something like a literature review and now, with renormalized expectations, I think I will be able to do so. Before I try to write the review, I will first try to I will try to break the problem into a few more manageable pieces. First, I need to gather information before I write the review. I will approach this in two ways: 

List of Models in Theoretical Biophysics: Create a list of a dozen models (including references) in the field of theoretical biophysics. Describe the model, the equations that encompass it, and the interpretation. 

Papers Relevant to Biomolecules, Exactly-Solved Models in Statistical Physics, and Combinatorics: Find and review five papers relevant to the three topics of your dissertation. Explain what your dissertation does that is different from the listed papers

I think if I complete these two tasks, I will then be ready to write a literature review, or to determine if my attachment to writing one is foolhardy. 

I have been slacking quite a bit. This is worth interrogating, but I will not do so here. I will just let this literature review work be my main task for this week and see how far I can get. If I do more, great, and if not, then no problem. 

Task List
# Create list of models in theoretical biophysics
# Find and review five papers relevant to the three-topic Venn diagram in dissertation
# Download pygame 
# Create list of basic machine learning topics

Learning about Random Matrices 

Yesterday I attended Grace Zhang's practice qualifying exam. Her topic was Random Matrices and her talk gave me a lot of background/summarizing information on the field. It seems that in general work in the field consists of finding the eigenvalues for matrices whose elements are drawn from Gaussian distributions. The distributions of the eigenvalues is often the observable for such calculations and apparently it is possible to show that for general matrices  matrices the distribution of eigenvalues looks 



which Grace called a model of a "Random Matrix Eigenfluid". The value of  is set by the properties of the matrices you're investigating. For example, you have   for Real symmetric matrices,  for Hermitian Matrices, and  for Symplectic/Quarternion matrices. Mathematically all of this seems quite interesting and would be cool to learn more about.

Kovalevskaya Top
A few days ago I listened to the Sofia Kovalevskaya chapter of Ian Stewart's Significant Figures. The chapter mentioned many things I didn't know about her work but some of the more interesting takeaways are associated with the fact that she seemed to be a mathematical physicists rather than a pure mathematician. This of course makes sense, since many of the mathematicians who laid the foundation for 20th century pure mathematics (analysis in particular) were pre-20th century mathematical physicists (I'm thinking of Euler, Fourier, and Gauss). 

I think Kovalevskaya's prominent work was in the field of PDEs, but apparently she also worked on Saturn's Rings before Maxwell did. She studied the possibility that the rings were made of a fluid, but later Maxwell (I think) showed that such a configuration would be unstable and the rings likely had to be made of a discrete collection of particles. 

The podcast also mentioned that she did work on rigid body motion. The system she postulated and studied is now called a "Kovalevskaya Top" and it is included in the category of the Euler Top and Lagrange Top as solvable systems of rigid body motion. The Euler Top is a rigid body, outside of a gravitational field, in which the three moments of inertia associated with the principal axes are all different. The Lagrange Top is a rigid body within a constant gravitational field in which two of the three moments of inertia are identical. The Kovalevskaya Top is a rigid body within a gravitational field in which two of the moments of inertia are identical and the third is half the value of the identical ones. 

I think I've seen the Euler and the Lagrange Tops solved in Kleppner/Kolenkow and Morin's textbook, but I don't think I've seen the Kovalevskaya Top solved anywhere. Maybe the solution is too difficult for an elementary text?

Weekly Review
I didn't write a weekly review last week. Not because I didn't do anything but because I was tired of writing down things to do rather than doing them. The decision seemed to work, and I managed to complete a lot last week. Here are some of the things I did:

I submitted a query/pitch to the Chronicle of Higher Education last Friday. It was for my essay "Price of a Harvard Education," and on Tuesday the editors responded that they were interested in the piece, and after some days of editing it (or rather procrastinating to edit it), I sent it to them on Thursday. The piece is now in its ~10th version and I think I managed to find a nice balance between articulating a new message and expressing that message in an impactful language. We'll see how this goes. 

I also finally completed major sections of my literature review. For weeks I was stressing about how exactly to write a general literature review for a thesis consisting of the solution to disparate problems. Each of the content chapters of the thesis has its own mini-literature review, and part of me wanted to use these disconnected reviews as the main review for the entire thesis. If I were to take this route, then my thesis would have already been written seeing as I already completed the introduction and the conclusion. Given this relatively safe and lazy route, I decided to try the more difficult task of writing a semi-proper lit-review for the dissertation. I figured if I could not do it, then I could always take the safe route. 

The crucial aspect of writing such a literature review was finding a narrative that fit into the larger story of the dissertation. There was a seeming Catch-22 in finding such a narrative. The narrative would guide which papers I included in the literature review, but I would only determine the narrative by deciding which papers to include in the literature review. This bind was a false one. The narrative did not come first, and neither did the decision of what papers to include in the literature review. Rather I needed to search and collect. Look for papers that were in various (sometimes only philosophical) ways related to one another and build upon the relationship something resembling a story.

I realize now that I was looking for a short cut, a clean solution, something that would lead me in simple and directed steps from A to B. However, such solutions are only possible when you fully understand the problem and the problem—of finding the narrative for the literature review—was certainly something I did not even begin to understand until I spent some time in the literature. 

Currently, the basic story for my literature review is that many of the famous models comprising the intersection of exactly-solved statistical mechanics and biomolecules are grounded in Ising-like models where microstates are defined by a list of independent "spin-states" and where the Hamiltonian consists of local interactions between these spins. However, the Ising-model as metaphor and theoretical construct has limited the types of problems physicists seek to solve as well as their methods of solution. In particular, motivated by the properties and successes of the Ising model, physicists seek systems which have many locally-interacting and independent degrees of freedom whose microscopic physics determine the macroscopic structure of of the system. Such models are consistent with the useful reductionist philosophy common to physics, but using the Ising-model as a theoretical motivation only works if the space of states for each degree of freedom is independent. For some biomolecules systems, like the dimer system we will discuss in Chapter \ref{}, the degrees of freedom are not independent since a particle interacting in one way limits the interaction possibilities of other particles; more specifically, the system microstates are related combinatorially. An objective of this thesis is to introduce a different type of model into theoretical biophysics, one which can handle problems in which the microstates of a system better resemble the elements of a combinatorial set rather than a list of independent spin-states. 

The other major task (or series of tasks I completed) was to finish my remaining preparations for my trip to Lagos. This included buying some itch-relief cream, making sure Uncle Gboyega had my and my sister's flight information, and purchasing random gifts for my cousin. I guess one sign of success is that I am currently writing this weekly review at my uncle's dining table in a house on the border of Ogun and Lagos state. I have been here since Saturday evening and I don't think I forgot anything. I am enjoying my time here, but part of me is counting the days until I can return to Cambridge and surroundings I'm more familiar with. [I wrote in more detail about my first day here in the five-star notebook with a purple cover]

So what do I have to do for this week? I think I can finish my literature review by the end of the week, and I also think I can write a concluding paragraph. After all this, filling out the appendix for the equations in the conclusion and correcting the permutation glass chapter will be the only things left. Interesting note about the permutation glasses: I think I misinterpreted my results. I said that the system exhibited no permutation glass phase since there was no evidence of the ultrametricity typical of spin glasses. But I think a better standard for defining the permutation glass is whether the respective system exhibits behavior not found in the ordered system. By this definition, the system I defined indeed has a permutation glass phase. Theoretically, I found that the temperature  at which the system reaches the  state at equilibrium is defined by the condition 

  (1) 

However, finding a  that satisfies this equation is not always possible. In particular, I noted that a solution does not exist unless the distribution  satisfies

  (2)

Therefore, the violation of the second integral equation indicates that even when the first integral equation is satisfied, the system can never reach the  state. This is what we define as the permutation glass phase, a system for which (1) is satisfied but for which  is not achieved because some condition—actually often more stringent than (2)—is not satisfied. 

From this new interpretation I can create a new phase diagram for the system, one which includes the permutation glass phase or at least a permutation glass regime. I will have to write up this new interpretation and try to publish it as a comment for the existing paper. 

There are many random things I'd like to start on/complete for this week. Here is a rough list:
# Write solutions to dice problem and the remaining problems in Smullyan’s text
# Read through and edit Rostam's paper
# Write “Gene Drive Probability of Fixation” problem
# Create list of basic topics in  machine learning
# Write solution for evolutionary rescue (foundations) problem
# Write a few pages towards “Field Theory and Symmetric Group” problem
# Problem Write Ups
	# Random Energy Model
	# Discrete Persistent Chain
	# Designability and Proteins
	# Original Ising Model
	# Gene Drive and Fixation Probability

Reasons for Writing about Structure of Physics 
There are some miscellaneous topics that I've been thinking about since conducting my literature review. First, I've realized that different physicists have really different styles when it comes to model building. Some physicists like to start from scratch with really general models (e.g., Derrida's Random Energy Model), other physicists like to work more phenomenologically building very specific models that fit a specific problem (e.g., Zimm-Bragg) model, and still other physicists like to take existing models and make small changes to encompass a new system (e.g., Lim's work based on Storm and Nelson's Discrete Persistent Chain). These observations have made me want to return to my soft-matters in physics essays that I've been neglecting, in particular the structure of physics section. I have so many things to do in the coming months I don't know how I'll make time to return to it, but from this literature review I think it's necessary to think of clear ways to understand all kinds of work in physics.

6:49 AM
Random Energy Model for Protein Folding
I don't like the random-energy model for protein folding. It seems at best a functional metaphor and at worst a poor one, and I think it can delude physically inclined biophysicists into believing they have finally understood a problem that they really do not. My main criticism is that it is grounded in assumptions which are most transparently reasonable for spin systems, and I am not convinced (even by Wolynes and Brygston's seminal paper) that the analysis cleanly transfers to amino-acid systems. My dislike of this model leads to the question of whether I should seriously learn it. Is it better to think in terms of a bad model or no model at all? Depends on how bad the model is. If the model is bad—as in very wrong—but lays the foundation for better models in the future, then I think it is OK to think in terms of it. But if the model leads one to think in ways which lead one away from better models, then it is probably to scrap the model altogether.

Weekly Review
Last week I managed to complete many tasks for the dissertation. I incorporated the literature review into the introduction, wrote its concluding paragraph, wrote a short summary of results for the conclusion, and wrote a draft of the correcting comment for last year's permutation glass paper. 

The major remaining tasks for the thesis are correcting the permutation glass chapter so that it no longer claims that there is no glassy regime, and including an appendix where I derive the equations presented in the conclusion. After I finish these tasks, I think I would only need to write the acknowledgments and then the dissertation would be complete. After writing the acknowledgments, I'll probably try to print the thesis (in B&W) or at least the intro and the conclusion, to edit them before I send the copy to my committee. 

I also need to edit Rostam's paper and send him the comments. Per my promise, I have two more days to do so. I think it's doable. 

Next week's APS meeting will start right when I return to Boston next week, so I need to take some time this weekend to write out a short schedule of sessions I'd like to attend.

Task List
# Read through and edit Rostam's paper. Pay particular attention to the derivations and the logical arguments
# Write out derivations for 
	# Generalized Derangements
	# Partitions, Partition Function, Aggregation
	# Quenched Distribution for Self-Assembling Dimer
# Correct Permutation Glass chapter in dissertation
# Create Schedule for APS meeting next week (List Five sessions/talks you want to attend)


Dear Editors, 

This message is to inquire into the status of my publication.

My PhD defense will be at the beginning of April and I wish to list this publication in the final submission of my dissertation, so I would like to know whether I should hold off on submitting the dissertation until this report is in or, given the expected time of the final report, I should submit my dissertation as is.

The correspondence page shows that a referee report was received at the beginning of this month, but since I did not receive a notice about the report, I suppose another report is outstanding. If so, when should I reasonably expect to hear from this other referee?

Best,
Mobolaji

Comments for Rostam's Paper

Reading through the paper, it seems like there are many sections whose conceptual connection is clear, but whose analytical connection seems less so. 

There are many postulations in the arc of the work which altogether leave it vulnerable to inaccuracy or at the least critique. There is the Robertson-Murphy relation on pg. 10, Adrian's result Eq. 7, the presumed mutual validity of both the RM relation and Adrian's result, the parameterization of temperature data as normally distributed about perfect MAH. I am rereading the paper to see if I am misunderstanding about the foundation underlying the conclusions, but from my initial reads it seems shaky. In any case, talking in person should clear some of these things up. 

Hope your week is going well. 


You say that the approach of parameterizing the uncertainty in Tm with a normal distribution cannot reproduce the negative correlations between abundance and Tm observed by Leuenberger et al. To what extent then can we trust this approach in denying the significance of the weak correlations observed by Leuenberger et al. In other words, why should we trust the approach in analyzing a part of the data set when it cannot be applied to other parts of the data set?

Weekly Review
I am many days late with this weekly review. I arrived in the U.S. at 5am on Monday and had a flight to Boston scheduled for 7am. But weather led to many flight cancellations and I ended up leaving NYC 12 hours later. I arrived home at around 9pm, and I was largely too tired to do anything besides order Chinese food (Drunken noodle and chicken wings) and go to sleep. On Tuesday I woke up at noon, unpacked my suitcase, went grocery shopping, and then went to the office for Sanchari's group meeting. Afterwards, I bought two pairs of pants at GAP, and then went to dinner with Victor, Rostam, Qiuming, and Aditya. I spent the rest of the night after dinner talking to Rostam about his paper. On Wednesday, I woke up at 6:13AM and made my way to the APS conference. At the conference I went to a talk by the editors of the Physical Review on best authoring and refereeing practices. There I met Dirk Jan Bukman, the editor of the article I sent to PRE. Later on at the conference I met up with Yue, and we had lunch. Around 4pm I left the conference and went to Neal's apartment, where I stayed until this morning. This morning I attended an information session by Princeton professors who were discussing URM recruitment. 

It has been a busy three days, but now I have the time and mental space to write my weekly review. I completed the two major tasks of last week and two minor ones. The first major task: I finished writing the conclusion to my dissertation and managed to create some additional figures for one conclusion section and an introduction. Now, I only need to print and edit the introduction and conclusion, and then I will be ready to send it to my thesis committee. The second major task: I read and edited the most recent version of Rostam's paper. I spoke to him on Tuesday about the paper, and we will probably speak again. He also asked me to review his poster, a task for this week's list. 

The minor tasks were things I've been meaning to complete since the start of the month. First, I wrote up about a dozen answers to problems in Smullyan's text. Second, I wrote up the solution to the dice problem I found on a business card for Fiverings capital management. 

What are the tasks for this week? For physics work, I need to print out and edit the current introduction and conclusion to the dissertation. I also need to write a response to the reviewer comments I received last week. Finally, I need to print and edit my comment on the permutation glass.

Weekly Review

Interestingly, in spite of a somewhat shortened schedule, I managed to complete most of my tasks for last week. I edited my introduction and conclusion. I wrote responses to the reviewer comments, and I edited my comment on the permutation glass paper. 

This morning I submitted the comment to the PRE, and I sent current drafts of my dissertation to Victor and Rostam so they could edit my intro and conclusion. 

This week's tasks are somewhat all over the place. I want to finally read through and edit "Intellect in an Intellectual Space." In fact I plan to do exactly that after I finished this weekly review. I want to incorporate the first referee's comments into a new draft of the "Self Assembly" paper. I want to create an independent document for the three dice problem, brainstorm code for a generalization of the problem, and finally submit my application and the problem solution to their website. I don't know what will come of this, but it would represent a somewhat honest effort to get a job outside of academia. 

I also want to complete my Van Vleck reimbursement form for the APS conference. There are also some languishing problem write ups that I should complete before I forget the background for them. There are three write ups in this category: The Random Energy Model, The Discrete Persistent Chain, England's Protein Design Problem.

And have I mentioned my own projects? The Generalized Derangement, Field Theory and Symmetric Group, Partitions, Aggregation, and Partition Functions problems? I need to do write ups of those as well. 

I also need to start thinking about how I will draft my research talk. This week I will just do some brainstorming. In my experience, it takes about two weeks to create a two-dozen slide research talk even if you have all the results. We will see how far I can get. 

Finally, I want to create a document for essay ideas. Something like my "personal problems" document but focused on writing rather than on physics problems. I think I had a document like this years ago, but nothing ever came of it because I never wrote any essays from the topic list. Let's try to make this attempt different. 

[//]

It is great that the physics department allows its students to work with professors outside of physics. I would not have been able to establish a personally interesting research direction or complete my degree otherwise. 

The administrators in Physics (Lisa, Carol, and Jacob for example) were all friendly and approachable people. They made being in the physics department tolerable even though I found some of my fellow students to be subtly hostile. 

Excellent idea to not have onerous written qualifying exams for the degree and to have formal course requirements instead. 

Also, excellent is the amount of time the department gives students to find a primary advisor. I only found my thesis advisor in the summer after my second year, and although this was on the late end I am happy with my decision. In contrast, in the Chemistry department students have about a single semester to find an advisor. If I was similarly constrained, I would have been pushed into making a wrong decision. 

There should be more talks on academia ethical issues in the department. Christopher Stubbs gave an excellent one in the 2017-18 school year where he discussed authorship and data manipulation, but that was the only one I remember hearing about during my five years here. There should be one at least every year. 

Two issues of concern 
- Ethical authorship practices: How should authorship be determined between colleagues? How should an advisor apportion authorship to his or her students? How much work constitutes a significant contribution? Students should be provided the answers to all of these questions. 

- Mentee or Employee: Are students the mentees or the employees for their advisor? Even if they are a combination of both, the student's time in graduate school should be primarily geared toward cultivating their potential as a scientist and not towards increasing the renown of their advisor. I have heard many stories in the graduate department in which this is not the case, but students accept the situation because they are largely ignorant about better work practices. 

Harvard should also publish ethics guidelines for both of these topics. 

March 15, 2019 — Friday 6:35 PM
Brainstorm Presentation 
What will be the structure of my presentation? I have some ideas about what I want it to be and what I want it to discuss, but no concrete outline. 

Some elements it should/might have
# Discussion of N! and its integral representation 
# Using old methods in new contexts to understand old ideas 
# Reign and hegemony of the Ising model 
# Combinatorial optimization seems indifferent to combinatorics? 

Possible story
— Venn diagram of combinatorics statistical physics and biomolecules
— Ising model in physics 
— Ising model in theoretical biophysics 
— Moving beyond the Ising Model 
— Protein Design, standard description
— Protein Design, Permutation Model
— Biomolecular System, Dance-Hall Problem, Self-Assembly 
— Aggregation, Hardy-Ramanujan, Partitions

Possible Story
— The essence of physics is the use of archetypes, problem-solution pairs which serve as the foundation for understanding the wider world. If you spend long enough in physics you learn about some important archetypes
— Sidney Coleman quote: "The career of a young theoretical physicist consists of treating the harmonic oscillator in ever-increasing levels of abstraction." (Picture of harmonic oscillator attached to a wall) 
— I never liked this quote because it seems too assume too much about what all theoretical physicists do. 
	— Good for people who study systems with many continuous degrees of freedom with local interactions. (i.e., good for high energy theorists and condensed matter theorists)
— For people who study systems with many discrete degrees of freedom with local interactions, the canonical system is different. For example, for people who study biomolecules a more appropriate quote would be 
	"The career of a young theoretical physicist consists of treating the Ising Model in ever-increasing levels of abstraction."
— What is the Ising Model: Description of the model; History of Ising and his work. Lenz
— There are many examples of the use of the Ising model in the study of biomolecules physics 
	— Helix and Random Coil Model
	— Discrete Persistent Chain
	— Random Energy Model for Protein Design
— These models share the feature of having local interactions between units that can take on a number of discrete values. 
	
— Physicists have to move beyond the archetype of the Ising model in order to understand systems whose microstates are the elements of combinatorial sets.

Draft to David

Hi David, 

I am thinking of turning some course notes into a short book, and since you have written and published numerous books, I was wondering if I could ask you some questions on the process of preparing something to send to publishers. Would you be available sometime next week for a short meeting? My schedule is quite flexible, so I should be able to work with any time that works for you. 

Best,
Mobolaji

Questions for David
Should I send a book proposal before I send a manuscript draft?
Is there a format that publishers like for a book?
Would there be a market for advanced undergraduates? 


Monday Mar 25, 2019 — 9:33 PM
Outline for Thesis Defense

I want to start with a quote from a professor at Harvard. Some of you may know this quote. 

The career of a young theoretical physicist consists of treating the harmonic oscillator in ever-increasing levels of abstraction.

Many theoretical physicists like this quote because it well characterizes their career development. They start about learning about harmonic oscillators in their first courses. The harmonic oscillator is treated quantum mechanically in later courses, and when these theorists finally reach quantum field theory, the harmonic oscillator exists as the foundation for particle excitations. 

(Picture of harmonic oscillator ball attached to a wall, then harmonic oscillator potential and energy levels, and then excitations of an energy field/feynman diagram)

But I have never felt this quote was quite accurate. Throughout Harvard or the Boston/Cambridge area, there are many physicists whom you can call "theoretical physicists" for whom the harmonic oscillator is not the canonical system that is treated with "ever-increasing levels of abstraction." In fact, for these physicists, the harmonic oscillator with its continuous potential and continuous spectrum of degrees of freedom does not well describe the systems they are interested in. 

Instead for physicists interested in a collection of nearest-neighbor
Instead, for statistical physicists the canonical system that is treated with ever increasing levels of abstraction is the Ising model. In the simplest version of the Ising model, you begin with a system of $N$ spins arranged in a line. Adjacent spins interact with each other and each spin interacts with an external magnetic field. This model was introduced in 1924 to describe ferromagnetism, but it is now used in many different applications in statistical physics.

For example, it is used as a foundation for describing the force vs. DNA extension curve, how proteins fold, and the helix-coil transition in proteins. In each of these models the theoretical description comes from an extension and reinterpretation of the Ising model. 

So in much the same way that harmonic oscillator is a canonical system for condensed matter theorists and high energy theorists, the Ising model is a canonical system for statistical physicists even when they are seeking applications outside of statistical physics (e.g., biology). This is because the Ising model is good at describing systems with many locally interacting discrete-valued and independent degrees of freedom.  

So we acknowledge that the Ising model is an important archetype in the physics of biological systems, however it is not universally useful. Indeed, there are many systems in which the basic degrees of freedom are not independent and thus an Ising model approach is not the most useful direction. 

This leads us to the main purpose of this talk: To present another archetype (or class of archetypes) in statistical physics which are just as relevant for biological systems but are concerned with rather different phenomena than those of interest in the Ising Model. In particular, we will be concerned with systems whose space of values for their degrees of freedom are not independent, but rather whose various states are drawn from combinatorial sets. 

As a preview, we will be concerned with using combinatorics to build exactly-solved models associated with biomolecular systems. The intersection between these three subjects will touch on problems of protein design, biomolecular dimers, and particle aggregation. 

Draw all three venn diagrams apart. Then bring them together in an intersection. State what combinatorics, exactly-solved models, and biomolecules (maybe) are. And then around the intersection populate the three topics you will discuss.

Protein Design

Protein Folding Problem and Protein Design Problem

Computational Solution to Problem

Introduction of the Ising Model

Why the Ising Model isn't Appropriate

Permutation Based Model — Permutation Glass

Basic Results of Permutation Glass?

Meeting with David

I just met with David Morin to talk about a book project. He gave me many interesting pieces of advice. First he mentioned that he self-published some of his books (e.g., the Classical Mechanics problems book and the Probability and Statistics book) because what he lost in advertising he could make up for in reduced cost. But he suggested that for one's first book, going with an established publisher is a better route. I didn't ask why, but I imagine that having a publisher helps lend credibility to the work, after which you can use that credibility to publish books on your own. He had some complaints about the sloppiness of the Cambridge University Press publisher he worked—the publisher would make incorrect changes and be unwilling to fix them—with but he said this might have been due to luck. 

Some advice regarding the book itself. It is currently ~60 pages and the market is intermediate to advanced undergraduates. David said that one way to make the book more attractive to an undergraduate audience would be to include problems that students could work on. Also, he suggested including explicit sections to the effect "This is how these ideas can help you in your Statistical Mechanics/Electrodynamics/Quantum Mechanics course." The flip side of making these additions is that the book becomes longer and is taken in a direction I did not intend it to go and which does not make it much better. So I would have to determine for myself whether adding more material to the book is worthwhile. 

For publishers he suggested I consider the Cambridge, Harvard, Yale, and Princeton University Presses. I will also have to do some market research to determine other books in the same genre that have already been published. Off the top of my head there is the six-easy pieces book by Feynman and the theoretical minimum book by Susskind. Both of which were published by Basic Books.

Dissolution 
I am facing the dissolution of another relationship. Neal will be leaving Boston May 9th. Yesterday I told him that I didn't think I could do a long-distance relationship. This came as a shock to him. He had believed we were on the same page regarding what would happen when he'd leave Boston. He thought we agreed, if only tacitly, that we would do what we could to make it work. And here I was telling him that I did not think it could work, or that I did not want to put in the effort to find out.

This admission hurt him. I think he was blindsided by it. This is my fault. I did not make the same exact mistakes in my relationship with him that I had made in my relationship with Amy, but the mistakes were similar in form. In an attempt to preserve our relationship, I hid my personal desires and my own inclinations, always deferring to him to make him happy. The truth is that he never asked me how I felt about his leaving Boston, traveling for three months, and then going to NYC for business school. Applying to business school is such a precarious thing that I never even envisioned giving him the ultimatum that is true right now: If he attends business school in a different city, our relationship would be over. 

Right now he tells me needs time to digest this. I understand. I need time to digest this as well. 

I have never mentioned Neal in these notes. One reason is that I only mention other people when there is some problem with our relationship. Tony, Jiwon, and Amy. All of my entries about them were essentially attempts to understand what went wrong, and to try to understand how I personally had failed. But since its beginning in December of 2017, my relationship with Neal has been pleasant and without drama. I saw him on OKCupid and messaged him a few days after my birthday. I think he messaged me a week later, after which we went on a date. I think that was a strange period for me. I had just finished a tumultuous month unsuccessfully pursuing Guan. Elana was avoiding me after a one-night stand. I was trying to go on a date with Courtney, and was wondering if I should ask Anne out. After all of this motion, maybe I was confused. Certainly I was lonely. 
 And Neal was nice. Far nicer than anyone I had met on these dating apps before. 

Some difficult truths: If I was more sexually and emotionally attracted to Neal I would want to preserve our relationship. As it is now, I am partly using his departure as smokescreen to hide the real reasons I don't our relationship will succeed. Ever since that first night we were together, I have thought about other people when we were in the act. Out of the many dozen times, we have had sex or its close approximations, my mind was elsewhere imagining I was in bed with someone else. No matter how hard I fought against these thoughts they came night after night. This had never happened to me before. It had never happened with Tony. And had never happened with Amy. Even when I was going through the motions of sex with Amy, I was always cognitively there, experiencing it in real time. But with Neal, my mind for some reason always sought escape. 

Reflecting more, there was one moment when I was with Amy and my mind clicked and below me was no longer Amy but some other girl. I think it was after we had a fight and I felt farther from her than I had ever before. Perhaps, my mind manifesting this distance beyond my attempt to suppress it, replaced Amy's visage with one that was more palatable at the time. 

This is not exactly what happens with Neal. Instead with Neal, it is as if I am masturbating with someone else's hand. I close my eyes and conjure up whatever image I need to finish, even though the only image I should supposedly need is supplied by the person right next to me. 

Why is this? Why couldn't I maintain a sense of connection to Neal while we were doing the very thing that was supposed to represent the culmination of that connection? 

I have said before that it is difficult for me to feel sexually attracted to someone unless I feel emotionally attracted to that person. What does it mean to be emotionally attracted? It means various things to me. It means that I trust them, that they see me somewhat accurately, that there is a resonance between us that connects us through our interests and our value system. I had this in spades with Amy, and I eventually developed this with Tony. But I don't think I ever had this with Neal, at least not completely. We are such different people, with such different value systems. Had we met under less pre-arranged circumstances, I am not sure if we would have even been friends. But I love Neal for his differences. I love that he is a preternaturally happy person. I love that he is outgoing. I love that he has so many friends who care deeply about him. I love that he reflexively believes that life is worth living. 

And at the same time, the fact that he wants to go to business school, the fact that he is an economic consultant helping powerful industries wage corporate war against each other, the fact that he loves extravagant trips to new countries and that he enjoys spending hundreds of dollars on exotic food, all of these are the surface level differences pointing towards more fundamental differences in what each of us finds valuable about life. 

But I still love him. I came to this realization late, too late to appreciate it for itself before it was coupled with the recognition that this love was not motivation enough to fight for our relationship. It is true: Despite all this love, I did not believe our relationship was worth fighting for. I did not believe that Neal was worth fighting for. 

As an attempt to sidestep blame, I could claim that if I felt differently about him, more connected and closer, I would try to find a way. But more honestly I know the fault lies in me. I don't have faith in our relationship because I don't have faith in anything. I don't have faith in myself. I don't have faith in life itself. Fundamentally, I do not believe it is worth living. I do not believe that the highs justify the lows, that at the end of my life I would look back on all that I have done and claim that the scores of years spent existing on this planet were some how all worth it. My relationship with Neal is a casualty of these convictions (or lack there of). He would not have been able to save me, just like Amy was not able to save me, because long ago I had decided that I could not save myself.

Run its course
Neal says he doesn't want to see me tonight. He needs time to digest what I told him about the future of our relationship, namely that I did not think it had a future. I have many excellent reasons for believing this. He does not remember my birthday. I think he is in love with at least two of his supposedly straight friends. His family was in Boston and he did not want me to meet them. He wants children and I do not. He wants to live in New York city and I do not. 

I wonder if this is always possible, to be able to look at a relationship and list all the things wrong with it, all the reasons it will not succeed. Thinking back on it, I realize I could have done this with all of my past relationships. There were many reasons why my relationship with Tony could not succeed, but my vision of that relationship is colored by my experience of it, and what my mind settles on now for the most important reason is the one which ultimately ended the relationship. And for Amy, there again were many reasons to expect failure in the relationship, reasons that Amy had once listed herself. Reasons which ultimately proved to be beside the point when it came to the time that our relationship ended. 

But Neal never listed any reasons why our relationship would not succeed. He had seemed to believe that it would succeed and that he and I would do what was necessary to make sure it did. Was this an act of faith on his part and infidelity on my own? Or was he delusional and I was the sober party, closer to the grounding force of reality? Who can say about such things? What I know from experience is that cynicism, in the end, protects nothing not even the thing the cynic most wishes to protect: his sense of safety. 

The phrase that comes to mind is that "the relationship has run its course." What an incredibly impotent and dishonest phrase. How can anyone know the course of a relationship? The apparitions initially seen from so far away chase you and chase you and soon the distance is closed and you are overcome with the silent white fright you only had nightmares about. Nightmares now made real. That is the fear I suppose. That is what allows one to believe that the course of a relationship has been set from its inception and that what comes next is merely playing the terrain laid out for you. A fight in a predictable place about a predictable topic, all predetermined given the nature of who you are and who your partner is. It was inevitable that I would feel jealous of Neal's straight friendships and think that he was secretly in love with his close friends. It was inevitable that the weeks during which we did not have sex would create distance between us, as if we were two buoys drifting apart at sea. It was inevitable that there would be a point when he would lead Boston, the same point I faced with Dat and Tony and Amy, and our relationship would end and I would be left only with thoughts of him, experiences of a past life that serve as painful lessons for a future one. 

All lies. None of these things were inevitable, and claiming the contrary stems from an unwillingness to take personal responsibility from my decisions. It is so easy say that the relationship cannot continue now because it will not continue in the future. And I know this statement is manifestly incoherent for at the time it is being made the only thing preventing the relationship from continuing into the future is one's decision to preemptively end it now. No, the reason my relationship with Neal is ending has nothing to do with children, or supposedly straight friends, or parents, or forgotten birthdays. I felt close to Neal, felt warmth holding him in my arms, and yet that physical closeness could not make up for the emotional distance that separated us. Our conversations never really penetrated into the things I cared most about in life, questions concerning morality, the structure of power in the world, the natural discontent one could feel about so many things. Neal, to his credit, was light and buoyant unperturbed by all the philosophical questions that plagued me. And although this lightness was a welcome contrast to my darkness it also divided me from him, making feel deeply alone even while I was holding him.

A Better Partition Function
I just had an interesting conversation with Vinny about something he asked during my PhD defense. Essentially,  he noted that my calculation of the equilibrium conditions in the dimer model contained some underlying quantum mechanical assumptions. One sees this from the fact that my equilibrium equations contain factors of λ which themselves include hbar, a typical quantum constant. In statistical mechanics, factors of hbar do not define the properties of classical systems so the fact that my equilibrium conditions include hbar suggests that they are inherently quantum mechanical. 

Hidden underneath this result is my assumption that dimers form without any vibrational energy contributions. This assumption amounts to taking the vibrational contributions to be "frozen out" of the system in the sense that the energy scale of vibrations are much larger than the energy scale of thermal fluctuations. By this difference in energy scale, each of the dimers exist only in their harmonic oscillator ground state and do not vibrate. Because assuming"no-vibrational contributions" amounts to assuming "stuck in harmonic oscillator ground state", I need to check whether it is indeed true that the energy scale of vibrations is much larger than the energy scale of thermal fluctuations. Apparently, if the reverse is true, the system can be treated classically and we ultimately find that the factors of hbar no longer contribute to the equilibrium conditions. 

My conversation with Vinny suggests I have a number of tasks to complete:

Consider a system of identical dimer-forming monomers. Check that if you include vibrational and rotational contributions then the factors of hbar disappear in observable quantities. 
Compute the vibration frequency for protein systems. Compute the associated energy scale. How does this energy scale compare to the thermal energy of the system. 
Repeat 2, for rotational frequency contributions. 
Do we need to make similar allowances for protein-dna, and ssdna-ssdna systems?

Natural Selection of Bad Science

In their paper, Smaldino and McElreath argue that poor research design coupled with a tendency to inflate the importance of results leads to quicker publication of important but not robust findings. Given that academia rewards publications of significant results (or at least of results that seem significant), the researchers who can publish more work, even if said work extends from improper analysis, end up staying in academia and propagating their research practices to their next generation of students. Thus, the bad science of these researchers is rewarded and is "naturally selected" for by the system of academia. Smaldino and McElreath make the important distinction that this "natural selection" does not require any direct strategies on the part of the researchers. Instead, the nature of the academic environment and way researchers are evaluated simple leads to the selection of researchers with a particular working style. 

In their own words

If researchers are rewarded for publications and positive results are generally both easier to publish and more prestigious than negative results, then researchers who can obtain more positive results—whatever their truth value—will have an advantage. 

… common methodologies in scientific communities can change over time not only because established researchers are strategically changing their methods, but also because certain researchers are more successful in transmitting their methods to younger generations. Incentives influence both the patterns of innovation and the nature of selection.

The essence of the authors argument reminds me of Jeff Schmidt's book Disciplined Minds. There Schmidt was concerned with the type of scientists who are selected through the process of graduate education. He concluded that scientists tend to be selected for their conformity and willingness to propagate the value systems of the systems that surround them, and this led to a community of experts who are more beholden to, at best, ineffective and, at worst, corrupt institutional norms. Smaldino and McElreath are making a similar, but more local argument. Their concern is that worse science is being produced due to a selection process that acts after graduate school, a process that rewards number of publications and the seeming significance of those publications. 

The authors construct an evolutionary model to represent these ideas. They consider a population of labs and they focus on the tradeoff between productivity and rigor of methods. Labs which use more rigorous methods, tend to have lower productivity and as the simulation evolves these labs "die out" of the the population and are replaced with more productive labs which use less rigorous methods. 

I think some of the ways Smaldino and McElreath model parts of this process are arbitrary (e.g., the relationship between productivity and effort, how experimental power relates to false-positive rate), but I think the essence of their idea is simple: It takes more effort to evaluate the correctness of studies and this additional effort leads to a lower production rate which adversely affects the careers of these more rigorous researchers. But this statement is a truism for any creative field which attempts to reference reality: It takes more effort to vet the conclusions of any non-fiction piece of writing and such effort cannot be expended in the direction of writing new work. What successful writers are able to do is find the correct balance between checking their work and producing new work, a balance which is largely set by their larger market. If a writer finds that they are able to become successful by publishing many poorly vetted studies, then they will of course do so. This I think is the essence of Smaldino and McElreath's argument, an essence which is not fully captured by their model. It is not merely the tradeoff between rigor and publication rate that leads to less rigorous studies: It is the fact that publication rate (especially of novel results) is favored over rigor. One could of course imagine a different model in which methodological rigor was valued over publication rate. There would still be a tradeoff between the two, but the evolution of the model would lead to a proliferation of highly rigorous labs. 

One question is whether there are theoretical analogs to the arguments the authors make about the use of statistics. I suppose false-positive and false-negative rate could be used somewhat widely to characterize scientific work in general, but theoretical work isn't always concerned with whether an experimental finding is robust. Instead theorists are often more interested in whether a theoretical explanation provides a correct and useful explanation of phenomena. 

Thus I am led to the question: Is there a method of theory development that leads to quick publications even if there isn't a proportional increase in understanding generated by these publications? What would a field of research that rewards such behavior look like? 

My guess is that it would look something like high energy phenomenology circa 2010.

After the meeting
Had the social justice group meeting yesterday. All around interesting discussion. We talked about the reading but we also veered into a gripe session on things we found problematic about academia. Abby mentioned the way current scientific journal articles seem to be short summaries of work rather than expositions meant to help the general field understand or extend the work. She noted the fact that the most prestigious journals like Physical Review Letters, Science, or Nature usually only publish text articles of a few pages in length, with most of the details of these articles relegated to a supplementary materials section. These supplementary materials sections, by her account, are reviewed less rigorously than the main text which means the crux of a paper is not being analyzed by the people who are meant to analyze it. I don't have experience with the journals that Abby listed, but from the one paper with a supplementary materials section, I can say that these sections are indeed reviewed if the paper refers to them. But I do agree that there is in general a problem with writing largely incomprehensible short articles. Although the seminal articles by Sherrington Kirkpatrick and Bernard Derrida are short, they are quite understandable and reproducible even without working through the longer papers that followed. But I can't say the same for papers now published in the physical review letters.  

Scott told us that in high energy theory, journals are irrelevant and only material published on the arxiv matters. I thought this was interesting since it means that these physicists in order to vet their work must rely on the community's interest in that work. Here's how the process conceivably unfolds: You put a paper up on the arxiv and if it is sufficiently interesting other people will read it, and send you personal comments about it. These comments could thereafter be incorporated into a subsequent draft that you post on the arxiv. But Abby noted a problem with this structure. 

There is so much material on the arxiv published each day that a researcher has to be selective about whose work he reads. Often then researchers primarily read the work of the well-known people in the field. If you are a junior researcher working with one of these well-known people, then your work is likely to be read by the wider community (provided you publish jointly with the well-known individual). However, if you are working with this luminary then you are likely getting what the community perceives as the most expert feedback on your work from that luminary him or herself, and so you perhaps require less community feedback than an unknown researcher. The feedback that the community provides you on your work is of course nice, but it may not be as essential to improving the work as it would be to someone who is working without the supervision of a well-known researcher. But this person who is not working with a luminary does not have the superficial label which shouts "Pay attention to this paper" and thus this person's work will likely not be read at all and he or she will not receive the feedback necessary for improving the work. This is another example of the Matthew Effect in research. Those researchers who already get excellent feedback from their advisors, simply get more of it from the community, and those who get little feedback, do not get any more from the wider community. 

I asked Scott that given the fact that the experimental basis for work in high energy physics is so remote, how does one evaluate whether a theoretical idea/result is good. I felt I partly knew the answer: Theoretical ideas are good if they augment our understanding of a field and give us new ways to frame old questions or, even better, new questions in of themselves. Scott's answer was slightly different and in retrospect seems circular. He said a theoretical idea is good if it led to interesting questions that the field in general found valuable. But of course, who decides whether a question is interesting? The implicit answer to this question is contained in an observation I made about high energy theory: Much of the theoretical work seems to be driven by the research agendas of about a dozen people. Without an experimental reference to ground theoretical development, people follow whoever they thin has the most prestige/power and, compounded, this leads to people chasing some theoretical ideas on the basis of their popularity rather than on the basis of whether the theoretical idea has some more independent value. Thus what determines whether a question is interesting is whether the larger community would find such questions interesting, and what determines whether the larger community finds such questions interesting is whether these questions contribute to the research agendas of the dozen people who supposedly lead the field.

This is part of the reason I felt I couldn't work in high energy theory. It felt too claustrophobic, as if I was being pushed into restrictive research directions based on assumptions and values I could not identify with. 

In another direction, we all agreed that journal referee process would be improved if it were double-blind, that is if neither reviewers nor authors knew who each other were. I imagine we all agree with this because we are graduate students and relatively powerless without any name recognition in our fields and thus our anonymity can only adversely affect our ability to publish new articles. I wonder if we would all feel the same way if we were 20 years older and more established in our fields? 

I didn't mention one major problem I have with the current structure of academia: The way mentoring students is conflated with employing students and how this conflation is always to the advantage of the apparent mentor. Abby touched on this problem by mentioning an index that could be coupled with the now famous h-index. Apparently someone on the internet suggested that a new index called the m-index be calculated from the average of the h-indices of all of the professor's students, and that this index be listed with the researcher's h-indices. There are perhaps problems with such an index (for example, the h-indices of recently graduated students would be quite low, and would it be fair to include the h-indices of students who immediately took a job outside their research discipline?), but the there are also problems with the h-index and these problems are mostly ignored by the community in favor of having a simple if inaccurate metric by which to judge researchers. The hopeful effect of the m-index would be to shame researchers into becoming better mentors. My cynical guess of what would actually happen is that academia would rebound in a way to corrupt this metric in ways we cannot foresee.

Flat Earthers Amongst Us
On Monday I watched the documentary Behind the Curve on Netflix. Really fascinating. It follows some people in the Flat Earth community. These people believe that the earth is flat and that the public has been mislead for centuries into believing otherwise. It was interesting to watch these people go about their day and discuss the problems they saw in the current explanation that the earth was round. At one point, Mark Sargent, one of the leaders of this community, stands on a beach and points in the direction of the horizon. He tells the camera man that if the earth was indeed round he shouldn't be able to see the buildings in the distance, buildings that he says are part of the Seattle cityscape. 

What I like about the documentary is that it provided convincing evidence that these people are not stupid in the traditional sense of the word. They do not lack the ability to reason, and from the experiments many of them conjure up to test their theories, it is quite clear that they would be good scientists. What is different is that for some reason they have rejected one of the foundational premises in physics and have formed a community around this rejection. It is through this community that they have defined their identity and so even when their beliefs about the earth are convincingly challenged by their experiments, they hold true to their beliefs and try to reinterpret their experiments in new ways. 

There are two experiments of note. In one, a flat earther purchases a $20,000 gyroscope to test whether the earth is indeed rotating. Although it does not seem to be a necessary omission in canonical "flat earth theory", the rotation of even a flat disk of earth is not assumed and instead the sun and the moon are presumed to move around the earth disk in halo-like arcs. So someone had the excellent idea that one could test whether the earth was indeed rotating by using an object which always pointed in a fixed direction of space. A freely mounted gyroscope with the center of mass coincident with the center of gravity is such an object provided it keeps spinning for a long enough amount of time. These flat earth researchers decided to set the gyroscope going and observe it over a 24 hour period. If the earth was indeed rotating, then the gyroscope would turn by 15 degrees each hour. And if it the earth was not rotating it would not. Beautifully simple science experiment. The flat earth researchers in the end found the 15 degree rotation, but instead of seeing this as conclusive evidence that their flat earth theory was wrong they rejected this interpretation and conjured up some "drift" force as an explanation. 

In the second experiment—which was actually a refined version of a previous one—the flat earthers set up two large plane boards in a straight line that extended many miles across what they believed was a relatively flat terrain. For example, for a two mile extent, one board was placed at the zero mile mark and the second was placed at the two mile mark. In each board, the experimenters carved, at 17 feet above the ground, a hole about the size of a canteloupe. One person stood on the far end of the extent behind the second board and a camera was placed in front of the first board and directed at the hole. The person behind the second board then sent light through the second board's hole and in the direction of the first board's hole. The experimenters reasoning was that if the earth was flat, then the camera in front of the first board would only be able to see the light shown through the second board if that light was held 17 feet above the ground. If the light had to be held higher, than 17 feet then there must be some curvature to the earth. The experiment was performed "live" so to speak, and we the documentary audience could see the reactions of the experimenters as they saw their results. The man holding the light held it up at 17 feet, but the man at the camera end told him he could not see it. Then, the camera-end man told the other man to hold his light higher and then the light suddenly appeared. "Hmm. That's interesting" said the camera-end man. 

At one point a camera man asks Mark Sargent what would he do if he for some reason, discovered that flat earth theories were wrong and that the earth was actually spherical. Mark thinks for a moment and says something more honest than I was expecting. He says that given the friends he has in the movement and his stature within it, he could not imagine himself making such a discovery. Discovering that flat earth theories are wrong would call into question not only his beliefs about earth but it would destroy his personal relationships, so that even if he was closer to the truth of the world he would likely be worse off over all. 

In the same scene, Mark unintentionally presented an interesting metaphor for his experience. He likened flat earthers to Truman in The Truman Show. In his telling, all flat earthers were created by their seeing cracks in the edifice of the world and upon investigating these cracks they found that a cabal of people were promulgating the lie that the Earth was round. The scene where Truman comes up to the edge of his makeshift society and leaves through an exit door parallels the life trajectory where true earthers decide to leave the public communities and discover the truth for themselves. As a foil to Truman and as the analog to everyone who is not a flat earther, Mark mentions the mayor of Truman's town. This mayor apparently has the perfect life within Truman's simulated world, and thus he never even has the inkling of wanting to leave. It is these people, Mark claims, who are comfortable in the society as it exists who have no desire to question claims about the roundness Earth. Mark likened himself to Truman, but then the camera man noted that the analogy sounds more accurate if Mark is likened to the mayor of Truman's society, namely the leader of a community in which he feels comfortable and thus has no desire to interrogate the community's foundational claims. Mark paused at this observation, as if he was considering it for the first time.

Are our beliefs based on reason or on identity?

Thursday April 18, 2019 — 11:16 AM 
The Nature of Belief
The documentary poses an interesting question. Are the things we believe grounded in reason or are they based on something else? In a previous essay, I argued we believe in certain things because these beliefs make it easier to live in a world we do not completely understand. But it seems that even when we gain more understanding of the world, we hold fast to our previous beliefs because this new understanding has come too late. Our identity has already calcified around our previous understanding of the world and thus correcting that understanding does not merely entail correcting some pieces of knowledge but rebuilding wholesale a personal history. 

"Any real change implies the break up of the world as one has always known it, the loss of all that gave one an identity, the end of safety. And at such a moment, unable to see and not daring to imagine what the future would now bring forth, one clings to what one knew or dreamed that one possessed."

This is the dilemma faced by any flat earthers who begin to suspect that the earth is indeed round and that the theory that they had been promulgating for years was just a long and tortuous path towards rebuilding the wheel. Coming upon this knowledge would force them to question their friends and their loves and the sense of community whose importance is revealed only when it is slipping through your fingers. No wonder these people hold on to their beliefs, because what is placed in danger when these beliefs are questioned is an entire life. 

Now, there are clear and unambiguous ways to test whether the earth is indeed flat. This knowledge is solid and not at all ambiguous. And yet the pull of the skeptical-identity is so strong for some of the flat earthers, that this knowledge does not penetrate. What does this fact—that identity can in a sense overrule evidence—imply about identities formed around more ambiguous claims, claims for which the interpretation of evidence is less clear? What does it say about source of people's political leanings? What does it say about scientists' attachment to the theories they develop? What does it say about the many unquestioned and unarticulated beliefs each of us harbor throughout our lives? 

What does it say about religion? I used to believe that religion was about faith, but now I believe it is about identity. It is easier to lose faith in a set of beliefs, but thereafter, these beliefs will not be relinquished unless one also abandons the identity around which they were formed. 

This depiction of religion unifies science and religion to a certain extent. 

The unifying element, what is found in both non-religious scientists and religious non-scientists is that both groups have formed identities around their belief systems and these identities are driving their beliefs rather than a solidly logical account of the world around them. Non-religious scientists would disagree with me here and say that this is  a false equivalence, and indeed the degree of faith that is necessary in religion is different in kind and extent from that which is necessary in science. But doing science indeed requires faith, if only one extrapolated from inductive reasoning. The scientists says "I have seen much evidence that the parts of nature I claim to understand are governed by precise mathematical laws," and from this claim she concludes that all of nature is governed by such laws. This second claim does not logically follow from the first and thus requires a degree of faith to believe. What distinguishes scientists from non-scientists is the difference in standards for engendering faith and this difference allows the two groups to form identities around their beliefs. These identities are the recalcitrant entities in interrogating what people believe. They are like the roots, and people's thoughts and words are like the leaves. From far away, all an external observer sees is the leaves, but what supports these leaves is the more crucial aspect in the foundations of the person.

I should be careful here. I don't want to make a relativistic argument about Science being just as good as religion. I don't think it is. There is a distinguishing element. Any society that has religion also has infrastructure needs that require science. The use of science in building the society's infrastructure reveals that science is a better lens through which to look at the world than religious faith. You can use science to study chemical compositions in ways that religion cannot touch. It is perhaps here that the conflict lies.

Combating Relativism
One problem with the above argument is that one might conclude that since both religion and science require faith, the two are equivalent and thus have each has equal license to frame a view of the world. I do not agree with this. I think science provides societies with knowledge, technologies, and frames for looking at the world that religion cannot provide, and religion provides people with perspectives on their life that science cannot. 

What makes this discussion difficult is that Science is used as a catchall phrase to refer to everything that uses what people think of as the scientific literature. But what exactly is science? It certainly is a way of looking at and studying the world, but it is also a body of knowledge, knowledge that is then used to use the resources of the world to build technology that is of use to human societies. But these definitions are still much too general. One could try to unify all sciences by their conscription to the scientific method, but not all disciplines in science use the scientific method the same way. It is true that the process of proposing a hypothesis, devising an experiment to test it, conductive the experiment, and then analyzing the subsequent data is common to the experimental core of various disciplines, but not all science involves experiments and even when science does involve experiments the objective is not always to test a hypothesis. There is a large body of theoretical world that does not make use of this experimental sequence, but which no one questions as part of science. And often experimental work can be exploratory in which the properties of a phenomena are sought by performing field-standard tests. The latter is often what is presented by the experimenters in Eugene's group meeting. 

So under the canopy we call science are many trees and many roots with foundations in far off places. What indeed unifies these trees? I think scientists would say, somewhat cryptically, that all scientists, whether they are theoreticians or experimentalists, are unified by a certain way of engaging with the world, a way which attempts to make thought more precise and rigorous by writing that thought out and subjecting it to comparison with the experimental world, in the case of experimenters, or by encoding that thought into symbols which have non-negotiable laws about how they are manipulated. 

Still, upon thinking about it further I get the sense that we can run into a tautology. This method of refined thought as a way of engaging with the world is what unifies scientists, but when one tries to specify what this thought looks like one ends up describing something very much like the scientific method of the deductive process of theory development in theoretical physics and mathematics. Namely, you attempt to describe this "more refined thought process" and you simply find yourself describing science as it is performed by scientists. That is you find the science is defined as what scientists do. 

I am likely eliding many important matters. There is perhaps a way to define science according to how the subject builds and augments knowledge. And maybe if I was not speedwriting this section I would be able to find it. But for now I will just conclude that the definition is no obvious. 

But back to the question of whether science  and religion can be compared. I would like to make the obvious point that science clearly achieves the objectives of science much better than religion can. Namely, it is difficult to use the teachings of any of the religious books to devise an experiment testing whether the period of a pendulum is independent of the mass at the end. But of course, this cannot really be an argument for science because the value system by which religion is judged inferior is an intrinsically scientific value system. It is like one was trying to decide between two metrics and in deciding that one metric was better than other, you first  had to use that metric or the value system that underpins it, to reach that conclusion.

In evaluating whether a scientific or a religious world view is preferred, one would have to find areas where religion and science intersect in their metrics for framing and understanding the world, and then ask which world-view better satisfies the metric. But again the rubric by which we define "better" might not be divorcible from a scientific view of the world, and thus we return to our original problem.

I think ultimately societies decide on which values they consider most important and the way they frame and interact with the world is a manifestation of those values. I am not sure how to make this statement cleanly separated from a relativistic claim about the universal validity of all values, but if I were to combat such a relativistic claim I would need to come up with a "background-independent" way to evaluate whether some values are better than others without tacitly assuming the superiority of the values I am seeking to evaluate.

The Research I chose to complete

And then there was my chosen research direction. In 2010, I started working with a new particle physics professor at MIT I had entered particle physics at a strange time. His main field of research was particle physics phenomenology and involved building and extending models of particle interactions. During that same year, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland began its first proton-proton collisions. Besides searching for the higgs boson, a major objective of the LHC was to find evidence for "Beyond the Standard Model" physics.

The Standard Model, the current best theory of the quantum properties of electromagnetism, radioactivity, and nuclear interactions, was completed in the early 1970s. Since then physicists have sought ways to extend the Standard Model to account for features of the universe it seems to neglect. Major omissions in physicists minds are the existence of neutrino masses, dark matter and dark energy, and apparent theoretical inconsistencies within the Standard Model itself. All of the models meant to address these problems fall into what physicists call "Beyond the Standard Model" (BSM) physics. The professor I began working with was introduced to me as an expert in BSM physics, and with the LHC just beginning its operations to seek evidence for BSM physics, it seems that the introduction was fortuitous. 

I thought I was well prepared to begin research. That my personal estimation was not true would not be surprising to anyone who has been through a first research project. The process of doing research is very different from the process of learning a subject. It's like the difference between doing laps in a 50 meter pool versus being dropped somewhere in the Atlantic and being told to swim to London. So, yes, I floundered trying to build the skills needed for this new type of work. But what was most concerning was that I had to do so with an encroaching sense that the work itself had less promise than the field, or my advisor, believed. 

The main problem with theories in BSM physics is that when these theories were first proposed they often predicted phenomena that could not be studied by any existing experiment on earth. Despite the theoretical and experimental omissions of the Standard Model, it seemed to be a really good and accurate lens through which to study most particle interactions. As a result theorists had to cast nets far beyond the theoretical apparatus of the Standard Model itself and build physical theories based on assumptions that could not be vetted until large and expensive new experiments (like the LHC) were built to study them. By the new century, it seemed that the previous generation of physicists had done their job too well, having developed the Standard model they had created a theoretical framework which so well described existing and future particle interactions, that later theorists had to devise many new theoretical models whose regimes of physical relevance were so far removed from daily concern that clear experimental analogs did not yet exist. 

That I chose this field as my area of research was something of a coincidence, or perhaps a lazy submission to the momentum of my trajectory. After MITES I learned quantum mechanics then quantum field theory. The books that I used were both written by particle physicists and thus often used particle physics as lens through which to frame the lessons in the subjects. Thus, when I sought a research project and a research advisor, I sent query emails to particle theorists, because that was the field of research I knew the most about. 

There was a veil of superiority as well. The most famous physicists of the 20th century (perhaps besides Einstein), were all particle physicists. These were the physicists who were seen by the physics community and the larger scientific but non-physics community to be the vanguards of the discipline at the time that their most famous work was being completed. Maybe something in me wished to be a part of this lore. Maybe a part of me wished to be famous as well.

Loose Ends
-  concerned phenomena that could not be studied   these theories is that they require experiments existing at energy scales far beyond what was possible when these theories were first proposed. It seemed that theorists had done their job too well, building theoretical frameworks which well described existing particle interactions, thus leaving the theorists with many dozen theoretical questions and models whose experimental analogs did not yet exist.


- HC had began its first was To be honest particle physics has been in a strange place for decades. Ever since the Standard model of particle physics was formulated in the early 1970s, particle physicists have been seeking ways to build theories beyond it.
